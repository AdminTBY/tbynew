The private sector and universities have a large role, since the country has only one major higher education institution that does global-level research. Another issue is 80-85% of the student body are female. Somewhere else, this is would be considered an achievement, but it begs the question why young men are not seeking out higher education. To address this issue, there needs to be a change in mentality, since a job is seen as a right in Oman. We are not building competitiveness in our human capital, and the private sector has not created enough jobs to support a competition mentality.</p><p><strong>How can Oman fully unlock its hospitality and tourism potential?<br></strong>We have seen development in the hospitality area over the last two years, with the total number of rooms almost doubling, a new airport, and convention center. For investors, the current environment is stressful because demand has not kept up with supply. Over the long term, these stress factors will be mitigated. However, hospitality is not just about building hotels, but also about developing the entire value chain of tourism and hospitality, from the moment one enters the country to the moment they leave. We must ensure visitors can easily experience local culture. The government has done a lot to open up, and the population is also working to open up, yet there is more to be done. Freedom of movement and ease of experience are what make Oman a great experience. We need to create an economy around this, which we are actively working toward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the major highlights in 2019, and what are the expansion plans?<br></strong>Due to the low oil prices more recently, the economy in general has been restrained. However, Oman is building for the future and pursuing a development plan focusing on diversification, privatization, and industrialization, with the objective of reducing its reliance on the oil sector. Leveraging on its strategic location, Oman's seaports are an integral part of the economy and are poised to drive growth and contribute to the Sultanate's diversification. In line with this, MHD recently entered the logistics space through a JV partner with special focus on Duqm. We are also looking into solar energy and are in discussions with various key partners. Oman is undergoing a process of restructuring and innovation in its transition of the power sector, and electric vehicles play a role in it. Electric charging stations have huge potential, and we are working on expanding in this sector. Besides this, we are also looking at the addition of new agencies to our current product line. The most recently acquired agency in automotive is McLaren, which caters to the super premium and luxury segment, challenging new technology and building cars for the future.</p><p><strong>What factors can Oman leverage to attract foreign investors?<br></strong>Oman has many factors that it has leveraged to attract foreign investors: Oman's geostrategic location, expanded logistics network, cultural diversity, and investment-friendly policies will greatly encourage new investments in the country. Most importantly, its friendly policies have enabled the Sultanate to forge strong bilateral ties with countries around the world and integrate with the global economy. Furthermore, Oman has invested in infrastructure with the goal of becoming a global logistics center. Oman's seaports, airports, and road network are constantly being expanded and improved. In the last decade, free zones have been the primary inducement for foreign investors to enter Oman. These include the Sohar Port and Free Zone, Salalah Free Zone, Al Mazunah Free Zone, and the Duqm Special Economic Zone (Duqm SEZ). Oman has also strengthened its legislative framework, and the new laws will further improve the business and investment environment, giving a much-needed thrust to the diversification and private sector-led growth in the Sultanate. One of the most important initiatives in this regard is a comprehensive privatization and PPP platform. The new laws make it easier to carry out the sale of state companies and sets out a clearer framework for private companies to work with the public sector. The new Foreign Capital Investment Law that went into effect in January 2020 aims to promote the Sultanate as a leading investment destination and provide a favorable environment for attracting foreign investments into the country.</p><p><strong>What does innovation mean for you, and what role can technology play in facilitating this innovation in companies?</strong><br>In the business world, innovation involves developing new products, improving existing technologies and processes, increasing efficiency, reaching new customers, and increasing profits. As an organization, in order to have an edge over our competitors, we need to adapt and innovate our processes to the changing trends and a new generation. The purpose of innovation is to come up with new ideas and technologies that increase productivity and generate greater output with the same input. Technology plays a critical role in facilitating innovation by making it possible for enterprises to experiment with ideas and concepts in a whole new way at a low cost.  Prototyping has become available to all through easy-to-use software. Through technology, one can simulate various market scenarios based on available real-life data. Virtual reality makes it possible to create new blueprints that make products and services come alive, thus making it possible to evaluate them prior to building or manufacturing them. Technology brings automation that decreases manual, repetitive work, freeing up time for more value-creating tasks that directly impact the business. Spending time on these tasks helps reduce costs, increase turnover, and provide customers with solutions that truly benefit them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are some of the major challenges US businesses are facing in Oman, and how will these challenges evolve in the post-COVID-19 environment? <br></strong>There are challenges in any environment and in any economy. All economies have their own particular challenges. Whether companies are US-based, international, or Omani, they face obstacles. With the new leadership, we are hopeful that any obstacles and difficulties will be removed, creating an even easier business environment in line with Oman's Vision 2040.</p><p><strong>How will the nature of partnerships between local and US players change in the medium term, and what will be the main drivers of these changes? </strong><br>Relationships between US and Omani companies—whether JVs, partnerships, or commercial representations—have always been healthy and will continue being so.</p><p><strong>What new opportunities can the drive for innovation and digitization in Oman provide US firms with? </strong><br>The US is a leading country when it comes to digitalization and innovation. The opportunity is like an open canvas. Oman is still in its infancy in these sectors, but there is a strong desire at both the business level and the government level to move in this direction in a robust way, so US companies are encouraged to bring their know-how into Oman, explore its potential, and look for opportunities for new technologies.</p><p><strong>Why should US public and private investors look at deploying capital in the Sultanate, and what investments do you most recommend?</strong><br>Why does any company invest anywhere? It is to make money. Oman has a number of benefits for investors. First of all, Oman is one of the few countries that has a FTA with the US. Oman is an emerging market with an FTA, and we have a legal infrastructure that protects foreign investment and allows for repatriation of funds. Oman has great opportunities: it is safe for both business and living and offers a high quality of life. The Sultanate also offers a young, prosperous, and growing economy and population. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How do you expect Omani companies to fare in the global trade slowdown, and what role does Credit Oman play in the Sultanate's diversification strategy?<br></strong>As an oil-producing country, Oman's need to diversify the economy is a fundamental focus for the country's future. This diversification strategy, however, comes with a series of challenges, especially at a time when demand is falling, with rising pressure on margins. For this reason, prioritization, agility, and innovation are key elements that every business needs to incorporate to survive and eventually grow. Some sectors will be more successful than others, but widespread competition will push players to become smarter and adopt technology and alternative selling solutions in their business model. Companies in various sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing, have been struggling to spread their products' networks beyond conventional markets due to a fear of not receiving their money in time or even at all sometimes. This is where Credit Oman comes into play, offering trade credit insurance to support Omani companies to sell locally to other businesses and export their goods and services without risking insolvency from the buying counterpart. The current market conditions in the country have pushed a good number of players to explore new markets, like Africa or Latin America. These markets often present a high degree of political risk, which is why we have products that cover this type of exposure as well. Rates and products are based off a thorough process of due diligence, which is why, aside from the products themselves, at times we simply recommend not to engage in business relationships with certain foreign players due to lack of information without a secured collateral.</p><p><strong>Are you looking to expand your work with SMEs?<br></strong>We are definitely looking at SMEs across all segments. In developed countries, the SME segment is quite large. SMEs in Oman remain underserviced by financial institutions due to their high-risk profiles. This will require more scrutiny. We are indeed creating a product with some banks and related supportive entities to help SMEs with domestic sales and exports credit guarantees as well. SMEs need money quickly in order to survive, and by providing credit guarantees based on upcoming trade transactions, SMEs can use Credit Oman guarantees to avail working capital facilities. At the moment, we do not have many export-driven small companies, but providing such a product will help SMEs expand faster and leverage technological trade platforms.</p><p><strong>Which markets have the most potential for Omani companies to tap into, and what are the main risks in the short to medium term?</strong><br>We use international standards in terms of credit rating for countries. We have country risk and buyer risk. We apply a risk-based assessment based on an international rating and then conclude the credit worthiness of that transaction. Oman's conventional destinations for exports given its location are GCC countries and the Indian subcontinent. We see a great deal of trade being conducted in Africa as a whole, specifically the east, mainly due to logistical cost effectiveness. Many parts of Europe and Latin America are witnessing some good growth as well. With the massive expansion of e-commerce globally, the world is now within everyone's reach. Credit Oman, like all export credit agencies around the world, plays a pivotal role in enabling trade locally and internationally with the support of the government. We are flexible and agile to tailor-made, fit-for-purpose credit covers for all our clients to trade with confidence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do SMEs contribute to Oman's economic growth?<br></strong>Opportunities exist across all the sectors, especially for SMEs. Over the last 10 years, there has been a lot of investment in cinemas, coffee shops, restaurants, and other leisure activities.  As a result, some of our entrepreneurs now have multiple brands and offerings. This creates a snowball effect, as it leads to employment generation, which in turn increases wealth amongst our citizens who can then afford to buy products and services (preferably from an SME), ultimately allowing that business and the economy to grow. IT, communications, renewable energy, and IoT are areas where the new generation of entrepreneurs can play a big role. Our objective is to invest in our own future. If we have a strong, viable SME sector, our businesses and ultimately the economy will be strong.</p><p><strong>How do you select those projects that will best suit Oman's marketplace?<br></strong>At the start of each year, we analyze the market to see the new players in the field and identify gaps in the market.  If we see a gap no one else is addressing, we see if it meets our criteria for intervention and development. We have a large shareholder base that helps us better understand new trends and future potential business opportunities that newcomers can benefit from. There are large corporations that use Sharakah's expertise to achieve their SME-related CSR goals, be it through sponsorship or providing training to young entrepreneurs and graduates to prepare them for a future in business. We hold Ruwad Sharakah events where we invite prominent businesspeople to share their expertise and give advice to our entrepreneurs, giving them a platform to ask questions and learn from the best in the industry. We are delighted with the progress we have made in the last 20 years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

We were not as negatively impacted by the uncertainty as other companies because we stuck to our budget, did not spend extra, did not expand staff, and had limited projects. We are now working on fiber-optic installation with Omantel and have had projects with Oman Broadband Company. We have also installed integrated security systems that include CCTV cameras and other core security infrastructure. In the last 10 years, we started to focus more on security systems and fiber optics and not as much on fire safety. We want to expand regionally and enter the Qatari market without any partners through our security systems. The recent changes to its legal and regulatory frameworks will be helpful for us. Our strategy for the next seven years will focus on Omanization in order to reach 30%.</p><p><strong>Given that there are not as many large projects taking place as before, how is this impacting your contract bidding strategy?<br></strong>We are looking for smaller players that we can engage with and participate in whatever is available. In 2017, our focus was on picking up huge projects and relying on those; however, a lack of success can translate into difficult cash flow situations. We have changed our strategy to focus on smaller projects, and our operations have smoothed out since. We are growing and are always interested in increasing our number of suppliers. Competition is extremely important to Oman. Once there are more players in the market, the competition will enhance our business and the business being done on the entire market. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the firm's key areas of focus?<br></strong>Y&amp;S positions itself as an experienced Omani law firm able to provide commercially relevant legal support and advice in line with international best practice. Our areas of expertise are litigation and dispute resolution, corporate-commercial, oil and gas, employment law, banking and finance (including regulatory and securities law), intellectual property, telecommunications, healthcare, insurance, property and real estate, consumer protection, and criminal law. We are privileged to count a number of major Omani and international banks and corporations amongst our client base.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the new FDI Law aimed at improving the foreign investment structure in Oman?<br></strong>Whilst it is our understanding that the new Foreign Capital Investment Law offers a number of incentives to non-Omani investors and expands the investment sectors open to such investors, the executive regulations to be issued by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be key to assessing the impact of this law and the extent to which it will improve the foreign investment environment in Oman. This new law will not affect existing legal provisions and legislation with respect to GCC investments, the Special Economic Zone at Duqm, the Public Establishment for Industrial Estates (Madayn), or free zones. The law provides that Omani courts will have jurisdiction to hear disputes between an investment project and third parties on an expedited basis.</p><p><strong>What are the main implications of the new PPP Law and the Privatization Law for Oman's business environment?<br></strong>It must be noted that the executive regulations for these laws have yet to be issued. As such, the below implications are based on a partial view of Oman's PPP and privatization regulatory regime. First, the Public Authority for Privatisation and Partnership (PAPP) is responsible for overseeing PPP projects in Oman and awarding tenders, so it will have a great deal of power in this business landscape, as a specific appeals process will be created for disputes relating to the tender process, project award, or project implementation. Nonetheless, the applicable government ministry will remain responsible for the management of a PPP project. Second, any PPP project must have Ministry of Finance approval prior to launching, with such approval given if the concerned project conforms to Oman's strategy and development plans. As these requirements are not defined, PPP projects may be undertaken in a wide array of areas. Third, PPP projects shall not be subject to the Omani Tenders Law, and direct approaches may be undertaken for certain PPP projects without a tender, subject to the Council of Ministers' approval. PPP projects may have a duration of up to 50 years, which is generous by regional market standards. Fourth, in the case of privatizations, Omani employees must be transferred and remain on the same terms of employment as pre-privatization for a period of five years. Lastly, and most importantly, the PPP Law and the Privatization Law both clearly state that 100% foreign ownership is allowed. It is unclear what minimum share capital requirements shall apply and what limits shall apply on government participation but we await issuance of the related executive regulations. There will be, understandably, controls on the share capital of project companies (including in respect to the creation of security or sale of shares).</p><p><strong>How can the Sultanate further develop the skills of its lawyers and legal consultants?<br></strong>Oman's legal landscape features legal practitioners who are practising law and students who are studying law in various colleges. Both face international and national issues. Now is the proper time to establish training entities to develop the skills of those who handle extensive legal work, whether arbitrators, legal advisors, or litigators. We have put this goal in our strategic plan and hope to commence it shortly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How can the Omani private sector successfully embrace the technological revolution to stay ahead of the innovation curve, and what unique factors will enable and accelerate the attainment of the pillars of Industry 4.0?<br></strong>Oman's private sector can successfully benefit from and remain at the forefront of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR)  being proactive and becoming early adopters of related technologies. Moreover, enhancing local value-added strategies—which includes encouraging innovation and technology transfer as well as training of the workforce—will help private Omani companies to move ahead into the 4IR swiftly. During the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Omani companies have demonstrated their ability to innovate and use technologies in a meaningful and useful way. I would like to share three such examples: the evelopment of breathing equipment; contact tracing initiatives such as mobile phone contact tracing; and manufacturing healthcare-related items such as masks and sanitizers. I am proud to share that a majority of such companies were SMEs owned and operated by promising Omani entrepreneurs.</p><p><strong>How do you expect demand from investors interested in establishing industrial assets in Oman to evolve, and what efforts are being undertaken to ensure the local market will benefit from the entry of new foreign players?</strong><br>I expect FDI into the Sultanate to be high in the future owing to a number of enabling factors. Oman offers world class infrastructure and an attractive legislative framework for foreign investors in the form of a new Foreign Capital Investment Law, Public Private Partnership Law, and the Bankruptcy Law. The establishment a new commercial arbitration process will help investors get quicker resolution. Oman's strategic location, availability of skilled local talent, abundance of land, competitively priced sources of energy coupled with security, peaceful environment, and tolerant society makes it the preferred choice for foreign investors. If we add the fabled natural beauty of the country and the warmth of Omanis, it enhances the country's attractiveness as an investment destination.</p><p><strong>What challenges will family businesses face in adopting to the new era of Oman's economy, and what contribution is expected from them to align with Vision 2040?</strong><br>Some of the challenges facing family businesses include innovation and sustainability, increased costs and competition, dealing with automation and 4IR, enhanced demand for talent, and establishing a corporate governance framework and succession planning. I also believe the most important challenges that family businesses face are internal—from within the family—rather than external ones related to the market or competition. In terms of aligning with Oman's Vision 2040, most family businesses are agile, and that differentiates them from other companies. They have the ability to adapt swiftly to the changes in economic policy taking place in the country under the wise and able leadership of Sultan Haitham bin Tarik. Therefore, family companies in the Sultanate will be able to contribute to achieving the goals of Vision 2040 in terms of technology transfer as well as contribute to job creation for Omani nationals and developing local talent, in addition to contributing towards enhancing in-country value (ICV) in the Sultanate. This is the best time to invest in Oman; with our renewed renaissance, updated laws to promote investments, and new investment opportunities based on public-private partnerships, Oman is ready and open for business, more so now than ever before.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role is ISC set to play in advancing the international reputation of Oman as a business destination?<br></strong>ISC was established to improve investment-related services in Oman, and the Invest Easy is a portal designed and developed as a single window for investors and business owners to apply for company registrations and business licenses. This system's availability and the initiatives that accompany it have tremendously improved the Sultanate's Ease of Doing Business 2020 ranking, taking it from 78th to 68th. Recently, ISC has supported committed investors facing implementation issues. Moving forward, the center will be tasked with playing a more prominent and central role in coordinating, resolving, and tracking project implementation. This will enable ISC to forge a more meaningful relationship with investors to ensure they obtain on-ground support to realize their investments. The ease with which individuals can engage in business in a country is a fundamental indicator of how progressive and forward-thinking the country is; hence, ISC's role and its initiatives are central to improving the Sultanate's international business reputation.</p><p><strong>What is ISC's medium-term growth strategy, and how is it aligned to the goals of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Tanfeedh, and Oman Vision 2040?</strong><br>The Ministry of Commerce and Industry is the central institution responsible for the administration of company registrations and issuance of business licenses. ISC's medium-term plan is focused on improving and enhancing its service delivery model, in order to enable the effective administration and implementation of investment-related services. As such, ISC's medium-term strategy is anchored on two main initiatives: the complete integration of Invest Easy with key public and private sector entities and the accelerated registration and licensing of businesses, and improvement of project facilitation. ISC aims to integrate the Invest Easy portal with over 70 public- and private-sector entities. To date, over 40 entities have achieved some form of integration with Invest Easy. The urgency to complete integration is to ensure that Invest Easy improves its services as a single window for investors and business owners when interfacing with the government on all services related to investment facilitation. Beyond its responsibility of administering company registration and issuing of licenses, ISC will seek to improve the Sultanate's project facilitation framework, ensure clarity, accountability, and responsibility, and monitor project progress. Government institutions are inherently complex when dealing with projects that require stakeholder engagement, approvals, and buy-in. ISC understands that project implementation requires constant coordination, frequent problem solving, timely escalation, and issue resolution to give investors the necessary support to complete projects and ultimately help build and catalyze the economy. At the end of the day, ISC is a tool to achieve the goals established by national plans such as Tanfeedh and Vision 2040. By granting an easy investment environment to foreign capital holders keen to do business in Oman, ISC, as mandated by Foreign Capital Investment Law, contributes to the diversification and balanced growth of the national economy.</p><p><strong>How will relationships between local and foreign private sectors evolve moving forward?<br></strong>The promulgation of the Privatization Law, PPP Law, and Foreign Capital Investment Law will significantly impact Oman's investment landscape, as a holistic approach has been undertaken to ensure a private sector-driven economy. These laws will not only provide assurances to investors, but also guide the development of new and future policies tailored to the needs of the changing global business environment. The introduction of such laws has resulted in institutional reforms as well. With the injection of foreign capital into the economy, the spillover effects will present numerous opportunities for local private-sector players to develop complementary or supporting business for the industry. With the promulgation of all three laws, the Sultanate expects efforts and initiatives that will contribute to the development of the national economy, enhance local added value, diversify sources of income, build local capability, increase employment opportunities, and strengthen the capital market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does Oman offer investors, and how have you helped investors coming to Oman?<br></strong>Today, more than ever, there are many reasons to invest in Oman. Beyond the rich possibilities the sectors at the heart of our economic diversification strategy (such as manufacturing, tourism, fisheries, mining, and logistics), an undoubtedly strong part of the Sultanate's FDI appeal are the measures taken to create Oman's attractive business and investment landscape. Amongst these is the creation of important infrastructure, such as excellent roads, award-winning airports and state-of-the-art ports, flourishing industrial estates and technology parks, and our free zones. An additional attraction for investors is Oman's portfolio of new business-friendly legislation covering foreign investment, PPPs, insolvency, and commercial companies. With factors such as these, it is no surprise substantial investment is making its way into projects across the nation. Take Duqm's Special Economic Zone Authority, the destination for a USD4.6-billion multi-source project financing venture between Oman Oil and Kuwait Petroleum International to develop, construct, and operate the Duqm Refinery. At Ithraa, we are passionate about helping our private sector capitalize on economic growth everywhere in the world. To this end, we support Omani businesses to ensure they can compete in an increasingly challenging global marketplace. On both export and investment fronts, it is worth noting the government's first-class services offered to both local and international firms. The Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry's (MoCI) Invest Easy is a great example of how we are streamlining the process of setting-up and running a business locally. We have also recently launched the Invest in Oman portal, a platform dedicated to driving and facilitating investment in Oman, connecting local project owners, investors, and entrepreneurs with the international business community.</p><p><strong>How do you help industrial players increase the competitiveness of the Made in Oman brand overseas?<br></strong>Omani-made products and services are enjoying tremendous international success. Non-oil exports are worth around OMR3 billion and can be found in over 130 countries. In addition to our in-house activities, services, and resources, we have partnered with the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Madayn on the Omani Products Exhibition (OPEX), a series of large-scale, international trade shows designed specifically to renew and revitalize the promotion of Oman-made goods overseas. Given the feedback we have received from participating firms, these trade efforts are paying dividends and helping change the way Omani non-oil exporters do business. As a result, now more than at any time in our history, Omani firms are selling more goods internationally.</p><p><strong>How would you define the profile of investors sought after by the Omani government?<br></strong>Historically, we have attracted large and long-term investors. However, today we are talking to a much broader investor audience, enticing them with opportunities in our growing SME space. Attracting and retaining inward investment is important to Oman's economic ambitions. We want the Sultanate to be a place where business can grow, succeed, and thrive. And we want it to be a place where great ideas and innovations turn into great products and services. As the new foreign investment legislation clearly shows, Oman is more determined than ever to deliver the pro-business environment international investors require.</p><p><strong>How do you envision the government's role in Oman's economy in the future?<br></strong>The process of privatization has been underway for some time, especially in the utilities and telecommunications sectors—an approach that seeks to enhance the utilization of resources, attract foreign investment, reduce costs, as well as share wealth across society. Still, the government continues to play a key role in the economic development of cities, towns, and villages across Oman, implementing a wide variety of policies and measures that bring opportunities and prosperity to these communities and ensuring a secure and stable environment in which economic development can flourish. Indeed, as we move toward becoming a digital economy, the public sector not just in Oman but around the world, will be even more active. From cybersecurity to technologies such as IoT and AI, governments will play a crucial role. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does CMC operate?<br></strong>CMC is an independent center responsible for ensuring the competitiveness of Omani markets. Since its inception and establishment, there have been significant efforts to develop the systems and, more importantly, engage in advocacy, talking to the private sector through the chambers of commerce to understand more about their industries. We have also been in discussions with partner organizations and regulators to raise awareness of the center and with international and sister organizations in other jurisdictions to learn best practices and developments. Competition is at the heart of international investment and trade flows, and we play our part in promoting FDI and economic diversification. It is a way of ensuring a fair and balanced playing field for any participant whether small or large while considering market structures and how various sectors work. Our work covers mergers, integrations, and practices prohibited under the competition law.</p><p><strong>What does the wave of new laws and legal updates to mean for Oman's economic environment?<br></strong>2019 saw interesting developments in the business environment with various laws being enacted around privatization, PPP, foreign investment, and bankruptcy, with an update of the commercial entities law. The government sees itself as an enabler by directly investing in sectors that need support. We have experienced this with Tanfeedh, a tool for investment and a regulation catalyst. We are one of those enabling units, but we cannot achieve it alone. The new laws mean Oman is improving its business environment, and a gauge of that is how we are becoming competitive externally. Our focus is now shifting toward adopting international best practices. We want to see sectors that thrive because of these laws. For example, PPPs will enable the government to provide additional services, while privatization will help the stock market improve its performance and inject new liquidity. These laws need to be effectively activated and enacted.</p><p><strong>What are the most exposed sectors in terms of fair market value and competition?<br></strong>Our work with our partners and various agencies such as the National Center for Information and Statistics and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will give us a better feel for what is happening. With respect to anti-competitive behavior, we keep an eye on the market's competition status. New developments mean new challenges. Digital platforms are coming to Oman and changing the game, so we must be ready. If someone can do things better than you, it is fair if they compete, but we have a problem if this is manipulated in any way. If Amazon comes to Oman and competes with others, it is positive, but if they buy everyone else, that is a different story. There are some examples in the region, such as the Uber-Careem acquisition, which can potentially have a negative impact on the market. Any company that comes into Oman is subject to our laws. We have the ability to work with our sister jurisdictions in many areas where we can cooperate internationally if companies misbehave. We have FTAs and WTO agreements, but we should also be mindful of our jurisdiction if there are cross-border issues.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020?<br></strong>We are still in the initiation stage, so advocacy is at the top of the list, with a wider set of engagements with businesses and various regulators. We will continue with our 2019 program to create more international partnerships with sister jurisdictions. This is critical for us to learn and share best practices and experiences. We want to conduct deeper market studies to understand key sectors that will have an impact on businesses and the consumers, which are the ultimate beneficiaries. We will align ourselves with the vision and objectives of creating a better business environment. We are keen to work with anyone who is willing to support our mission of fairer markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did you manage to bring the company to this stage in such a short time?<br></strong>The company was founded in 2015 and started operations in 2017. In Nigeria, we have operated USD1.2 billion worth of assets, and we are looking to grow our footprint. We took advantage of the policies of Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), which wanted to increase participation of indigenous companies in the oil and gas space; however, we also wanted to make sure that we are promoting value to our clients. ODENL's vision is to be proudly Nigerian, but in terms of operations, we want to compete with the best worldwide. What has set us apart is our professionalism, service delivery, and Nigerian roots.</p><p><strong>How did you manage to invest in your fleet and equipment?<br></strong>We spoke with several international drilling contractors about what we wanted to do. We were looking for companies that were the best strategic fit for us in terms of our outlook, professionalism, and values. We went into partnership with Valaris because we felt it was the best fit, and this has proved to be right decision as it is clear that we would not have succeeded without the backing of such a sound company. Valaris is an investor and minority stakeholder in the business, so we are still a 100% indigenous company.</p><p><strong>How do indigenous players manage without international partnerships?<br></strong>Not many Nigerian companies have been able to grow in a sustainable manner, especially in the services sector. All those who have been successful have had an international partnership. We have been speaking with NCDMB and the regulators, saying there needs to be more stakeholder engagement. If we are to succeed in developing local capacity, financial institutions have to play a critical part, as there needs to be more long-term thinking about how loans are structured for industry participants. Otherwise, we will take one step forward and several steps backwards. Those discussions are still ongoing and we hope that they will go in the right direction, but as most things, it will take some time.</p><p><strong>What is your opinion of the new deep offshore royalty passed by the government?<br></strong>While we understand the government's intention, there is concern in some quarters that the opposite of what it is trying to achieve might happen. While it is true that government revenue has been less than desired, the uncertainty around the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) has in fact resulted in more loss than the royalty issue. If the PIB had been sorted out and there was a more robust framework, a large amount of the money that has gone to Mozambique and Ghana would have found its way to Nigeria.</p><p><strong>What if the government's intention is to fully localize the offshore space?<br></strong>If we look at the onshore space, which has been localized, it is still not optimized. Many of the fields owned by local entities are still not in operation, even after several years. This is because they lack either the technical or the financial capacity. Raising funds is a challenge. If we can get local enterprises to form a rig-sharing club and string them together into a 10-15 well operation, then what was not economically viable for each of them individually may become viable as a group. And it may be possible to procure funding for this type of “club." The same idea will not really work in the offshore space, where the technical and funding requirements are multiples of what they are in the onshore space.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for 2020?<br></strong>I am cautiously optimistic about 2020. On the deepwater drilling side, I do not see that much growth in the market. Even before the announcement of the law revision of the royalty terms, I did not see much growth. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Aiteo has become the top indigenous oil producer in Nigeria. How did it achieve this? <br></strong>Aiteo started as a trading company founded by Benedict Peters. Aiteo Exploration and Production was created in 2014 to participate in the divestment exercise of IOCs, specifically Shell. Aiteo EMP became the preferred bidder to acquire a 45% stake in Shell, Total, and Agip in OML29 in the Niger Delta. Through that acquisition, Aiteo E&amp;P made the largest OFID in the oil and gas industry. However, shortly after the acquisition, the oil price plummeted, and we had to increase our volumes to get more cash to meet commitments and keep the asset going. We deployed pipes and an array of strategies to push production, and within less than 18 months we were producing 90,000bpd, up from 25,000bpd. Currently, production stands at around 70,000-75,000bpd, as this is a nearly 40-year-old asset with many integrity issues. Part of the package we acquired included the operation of a 117-km trunk line, a key national oil and gas infrastructure with a designed capacity of 600,000bpd to carry crude. When we took over the operations of the pipeline, it was operating at over 60% reliability, which we increased to over 80%.</p><p><strong>What is Aiteo's contribution to local oil output?<br></strong>Some 400,000bpd come from indigenous operators, of which the Aiteo JV with NNPC produces about 25%. However, Aiteo also has interests in electricity generation so we also participated through our Aiteo Power sister company in the divestment of the NIPP power project. We are also the preferred bidder for another three power plants. Moreover, our downstream business set up an extensive downstream facility with two tank farms in Lagos and Port Harcourt for a combined capacity of over 200 million liters of product. Aiteo Group has a multi-business line, and our infrastructure sector is managing the pipeline. Together, there is Aiteo Infrastructure, Aiteo Power, Aiteo EMP, and Aiteo Downstream.<br>What role do you see indigenous companies further acquiring, and what challenges will they find?<br>Most indigenous companies came into this sector either through direct acquisitions or marginal field distribution, and both these routes require financing. Entry costs were also fairly high. Looking back, even in the midst of challenging business environments, they have done well. For a country that produces 2 million bpd, 400,000—or 25%—by indigenous producers within the space of five to six years is commendable. However, there are still challenges they will face, such as oil theft and pipeline vandalism. In addition, companies need to seek alternative financing mechanisms to get projects off the ground. There are also some deals that certain companies have been doing with technology partners or service providers with NNPC to provide the necessary financing.</p><p><strong>Do you expect any consolidation between Nigerian oil and gas companies?<br></strong>I would not rule it out, though in the immediate term it would be tricky because people have different portfolios of debt they are managing. For consolidation to happen, you need a solution to synchronize these debts to be able to properly value the companies. We are still in the early stages of big indigenous players. As they mature, some consolidation or a joint venture arrangement will become imperative. In Nigeria today, Shell, Total, Agip, Chevron, and Exxon are working together on certain projects, and I see that happening with the Nigerian companies over time.</p><p><strong>How is Nigeria progressing with regards to monetizing its huge gas resources?<br></strong>I do not think Nigeria has a choice. First, people are moving into cleaner fuels, and natural gas is cleaner. Second, electricity is scarce in Nigeria, and gas still provides the cheapest way to increase electricity production. Ultimately, we will come around to utilizing Nigeria's natural gas reserves, which are ranked about seventh in the world and will help us diversify our economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>2019 was a great year for Saipem globally, with contracts amounting to USD400 million. Saipem Nigeria was also awarded the biggest ongoing project in the country. What does the LNG Train Seven Project mean for you?<br></strong>2019 was indeed a good year both for Saipem worldwide and in Nigeria. As we speak, the Train Seven LNG plant project has not been awarded yet, but we have been selected and are waiting for the client to make the final investment decision. 2019 was especially good in Nigeria because we successfully completed the Egina Oilfield Project, the first megaproject done completely under the Nigeria Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act. We have also just completed Shell's Bonga Northwest Project, while works for the Okpai Power Plant are still ongoing for Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) and are nearing completion of phase two. We are still working on the Dangote Fertilizer Project, which is a challenging but important project. It is the first megaproject completely awarded to a private, 100% indigenous client without the involvement of an international oil company or the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).</p><p><strong>As an international company, how does Saipem operate in a project that is 100% local?<br></strong>The act mentioned before gives advantages to Nigerian companies, but it does not prevent foreign ones from winning contracts. The act tries to set the framework and basis for international companies to maximize their presence in the country and foster the development of local content. There are some required thresholds respecting the quantity of local content, but there is also the provision of waivers under the act when the capacity cannot be found within Nigeria. At Saipem, we see this law not as a barrier, but as a recognition of Saipem's investment: we have local content in our DNA wherever we operate in the world, and our operations are proof of that. In fact, this law was a positive surprise for us because we implemented local content long before the legislation came in. We have been in the country for more than 50 years. We have an almost 1-million-sqm fabrication yard in Port Harcourt that we built long before the law and its guidelines. It is a law that not only fosters the development of local companies, but also gives international companies the tools to work in Nigeria. In this way, it is also a recognition of the investment of companies like Saipem in Nigeria. In certain respects, the legislation has even boosted our competitiveness, because while some other companies had to catch up in terms of local content, we were already set up for it.</p><p><strong>When embracing local content and local talent, what main challenges do you encounter?<br></strong>The major problem is the availability of resources, both in terms of manpower and assets. But the biggest issue in Nigeria for me is the lack of continuous workloads in projects. Saipem has big shoulders, so it can cope for a period without projects; it has operations worldwide and has financial structures to manage this. But looking from the perspective of an indigenous contractor, they cannot invest if there are no jobs; so when projects come up, they do not have the specialized workforce and facilities to tackle the job. However, our motto is, “Here to stay." Yes, we face challenges, but if we do not take them on, they will always be there. If we continue to engage with and support a local company, they will be more efficient each time. If you want to come here to do one project and run away, local content will be a barrier. It will make you less effective. But, if you are a company that plans to stay, like Saipem Nigeria, the local content requirements give you more opportunities in the long run. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you seen an improvement in the road logistics situation in Apapa over the past year?<br></strong>There have been improvements, but not as much as I predicted. The road is almost complete. It is not right up to the port gate, but it is accessible. In 2019, a whole section was closed. Now, the whole road can be used, even though some areas are not finished. They have employed government agencies, including the navy and customs. There are some checkpoints, which at least reduces the congestion at Apapa slightly. There is a line where the authorities let a certain number of trucks through in a day. It works in terms of the traffic flow; one does not get into a situation where they are sitting on the road for days. You know it will take an X amount of time to get to the front of the queue. The problem is cost, which has increased. However, now at least we know the cost and timeframe of getting goods into Apapa. In the past, something that may have taken 10 days to get into Apapa today takes about two. Things are improving.</p><p><strong>What is causing the congestion in Apapa?<br></strong>Every year, there are more trucks on the road. Once there is a project, either the transporter or the company purchases more trucks to service that project. Once that project ends, those trucks stay; they get the majority of their work from Apapa. This means we have more trucks on the road compared to three years ago. In 2014, there were fewer trucks and better road infrastructure. There was no barge movement for consumers then, but it was still easy.</p><p><strong>How much of your empty cargo volume is road versus barges?<br></strong>The problem is with capacity, especially in the ports. The core business at the ports is to receive import cargo and then send out export cargo. That means one cannot deploy resources to empties. They cannot keep vessels waiting outside, either. It is based on capacity availability. For two of the shipping lines, we do six to eight barges per day, though those two shipping lines want to do more. They could probably do double. We have other shipping lines enquiring, too but we are close to full capacity as far as handling barges are concerned</p><p><strong>What do you anticipate revenue and growth in the business in the coming year?<br></strong>The empty container business will not go on indefinitely. There will still be scope for empty returns, though not the volumes we are seeing now. One of the areas we want to do is the full containers as long as it can be evacuated to an off dock immediately. We do not have the space to store and have customs agents come and take three or four weeks to clear a container. We need the containers out to receive the next vessel. That is one area where we are actively speaking to potential partners to ensure we can bring maybe two vessels a month. 1,000TEUs a month is a realistic target for us. We are doing a great deal of steel products as well. The challenge is for us is to make sure we can offer all these services and do it in a way such that no one is neglecting any of the clients. We also seek to be as efficient as possible and maximize revenue. Our challenge at the moment is picking and choosing which business makes sense. We have more demand than our capacity can allow. It is a good place to be in, but sometimes one is so busy with the operation that they need to take a step back and determine which business ventures make sense.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are your core activities in Nigeria?<br></strong>Sana Group is special because it continuously raises the standard in all the construction sectors it serves. We are active in four distinct sectors. The main business focus is in the construction of factories, ranging from light industries and warehouses to heavy industrial plants. Our turnkey activities include design and execution for the food industry, leading to Sana Global Construction's recognition as the leader in this particularly specialized and demanding sector. Sana Global Construction recently completed an expansion of the Kellogg factory in Lagos, which was also built by Sana Global. Both projects are good examples of our exceptional capability and performance. Through our work, we raised hygiene and operational standards. We are proud to have improved the standard of construction in the food sector. Sana Group's health and safety standards and its reputation for excellence in project execution is world class. We strive to ensure that every project we execute is better than the previous one. Our second business focus is the manufacturing and trading of construction chemicals and the third is the manufacturing of high-quality cement blocks. The fourth sector Sana Group participates in is structural steel fabrication. Recognizing an unmet demand for high-quality steel fabrication, we established Sana Building System (SBS), arguably the most important part of our business. SBS is a state-of-the-art pre-engineered building (PEB) and hot rolled steel structures (HRSS) design and fabrication company. It is currently the only operation of its type in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about the PEB design?<br></strong>There are two basic types of steel structures. One is called hot rolled or HRSS, which involves buying mill-produced beams and cutting, drilling, and welding them. The other type is PEB. Our PEB engineering programs analyze each component in a structure to identify levels of high stress and then produce custom designs to optimize steel content to absorb pressure. PEB design ensures efficient inter-dependency between a building's steel frames, steel secondary components, and cladding. This results in an extremely competitive building solution compared to other construction options. Until the establishment of SBS, such structures were imported, mainly from the UAE. We import high-grade plates, sheets, and coils and fabricate them into engineered beams in our factory in Nigeria. The entire engineering and design process are done in-house by our professional engineers. PEB is an engineered product, which means we employ the latest engineering software capable of designing buildings to the most demanding international standards. Engineers input the proposed building's dimensions, select the applicable building code, and a fully code-compliant design is generated. Skilled structural draftsmen produce detailed shop fabrication drawings, which SBS' experienced fabrication shop workforce follow to precisely cut plates and assemble the welded beams. This process is very efficient. It invariably results in a savings of at least 20-30%.  This cost savings in fit-for-purpose PEB fabricated steel is a huge advantage. When compared to concrete construction, the PEB cost advantage is even greater. We are the first company to provide this turnkey solution in Nigeria. This innovative product will be available once SBS' factory is commissioned in May 2020. SBS will virtually eliminate the need for expensive imported steel structures, conserving Nigeria's hard currency. It is a high-tech product that also adds value to the general community. SBS invests in the latest technology and conducts continuous training to provide its well-educated technical staff with the right skills to perform their demanding tasks.</p><p><strong>What are Sana Group's key priorities for 2020?<br></strong>First, we want both SBS and Sana Blocks to be considered the preferred choices within their target markets. Another priority is to expand our market share in the road-works construction sector. Following the launch of SBS, we intend to enter the low-cost, affordable housing market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you witnessed increased interest from foreign and local investors toward Nigeria's infrastructure?<br></strong>Interest has always been high, but we need more. The level of investment is still a drop in the ocean compared to the deficit. The challenge is to find bankable projects, as investors are not just interested in names and titles. Investors should look at projects with a solid business case, with understood risks. These projects need to have gone through a proper procurement process, in line with the regulatory environment in the country for PPPs. We are open for business, but we need significantly more effort to ensure there is a constant flow of bankable projects into the market to attract more investment. We still have our challenges with roads, healthcare, water, and airports across all sectors. There is a nexus between infrastructure, development, and prosperity, as no society can become economically buoyant without solid infrastructure. This is what the national master plan is all about. We need to spend USD3.1 trillion over the next 30 years to raise our stock of infrastructure to 70% of GDP. By definition, a 1% increase in one's spending on infrastructure stock results directly in a 1% increase in GDP. This is something that investors cannot take out of the country with them, unlike profit.</p><p><strong>What is holding infrastructure back?<br></strong>Projects do not become bankable by an act of God. Infrastructure normally goes through a number of phases, with detailed, sophisticated feasibility studies. You need significant human capital to do that. We do not have an abundance of this human capital. You also need project development funding. If one requires external consultants to help them prepare these projects, then that becomes expensive. You need patient capital, too, and it needs to be invested upfront. Moreover, there are also issues around political will.</p><p><strong>What is ICRC doing to address these challenges?<br></strong>We are working hard to ensure we create an ecosystem where there is development funding for these important projects. We are also about create the ICRC Academy. That will be an infrastructure academy that focuses on developing the human capital we need to take on these projects. In the UK, there is an Infrastructure Projects Authority in the cabinet and the Project Academy in Cambridge, where people learn how to develop projects. It is not something you study in university, as each project requires a multiplicity of skills. You need people who have the skills to be able to integrate and pull that together. There are a series of critical issues that play a crucial role. In Nigeria specifically, we have jurisdiction issues between the states and the federal government. There is a rivalry sometimes, particularly around land. If you want to expand the highway, then you have to get land from the states, for example. But these are challenges that are surmountable; India and China have shown it is possible. More importantly, we have let the deficit grow for too long, without doing anything. It will take time to prepare the feasibility, make the projects bankable, and go through a competitive procurement process. The process must be transparent and competitive, so that people will feel safe to bring their capital. All this takes time. What is important is the effort. Lekki Deep Water Port is a huge new investment. The Abuja-Kaduna Pipeline is also happening, and these will change the face of our country. We have 69 projects there ready and in place. About 138 projects are in the pre-contract stage.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are some of the services Unireach provides?<br></strong>Indeed, we have been doing some procurement under our supply chain management services upon request but decided a few years ago to assign a dedicated team to assist our clients in their procurement needs to ensure they get the right product with the exact required specs at the best possible cost. As for the mining sector and in the same vein, we recently established a new corporation to locally purchase different types of minerals of Nigerian origin from identified and certified mining companies in order to export and supply our overseas clienteles. After many months of official accreditation and licensing period as well as due diligence process by our clients, we are proud that presently we are busy preparing our first major purchase order for a blue-chip German company.</p><p><strong>What challenges do you face in the logistics business in Nigeria in general and while operating inside and around Lagos ports?<br></strong>We have been struggling for a few years now with bad roads surrounding Lagos ports in particular and from lack of suitable infrastructure for trucks and tanks to operate within that busy area of Lagos. We have tried to cope along with importers and our partners in the same line of business, but it has not been easy since we cannot pre-plan timelines for deliveries or budget a landed cost of a project. Once the customs clearing process is correctly performed, consignments can be ready to get loaded out of ports in an average timeframe of a week; however, excessive delays experienced in getting trucks inside terminals to load containers and return empty ones back to ports remain our toughest challenge and frustration, budget wise.</p><p><strong>How have you managed to thrive amidst such challenging circumstances?<br></strong>Key players survived simply because they played their cards right. We definitely experienced our share of loss from the economic crises but were able to somehow weather it due to our team. Our decision to diversify and venture into new businesses and territories gave us an edge and helped us reach our present position.</p><p><strong>What is your mid- to long-term strategy for success?<br></strong>Like all other business owners and entrepreneurs, we invest, create job opportunities, engage individuals, and work hard to achieve set goals and reach a steady business growth. In return, our constant and major concerns are to have a steady and strong economy, a healthy social and work environment, security, and reliable government multi services. We have been lacking in some areas but try to make do the best we can. Our mid- to long-term business strategies and priorities are to ensure we succeed in our different ventures, with our usual focus on the supply chain management being our “niche" service and on the newly established and promising business of minerals trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Average 4% GDP Growth Since 2008]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mohamed-benchaaboun-minister-economy-finance-morocco]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>After just over a year of your appointment as Minister, what achievements are you most proud of?</h4><p>Allow me first of all to emphasize that, under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Morocco has strongly boosted its reform process by launching large-scale projects accelerating the process of structural transformation of our economy and achieving strong and more inclusive growth, thus speeding up our country's economic emergence. In line with this, we have developed a pragmatic and more results-oriented approach to address the issues facing this department. In the macroeconomic field, we are exploring alternative solutions to reconcile consolidating macroeconomic stability with social and infrastructure needs. We intend to involve the private sector to a greater extent in the construction of infrastructure through PPPs to enhance the effectiveness of public investment and to better target social expenditure. Regarding reform, our action will be directed toward those able to concretely improve business environment, in particular SMEs, and thereby promote investment, employment, and inclusiveness. We resolved, last year, the problem of the VAT credit, which was weighing heavily on companies' cash flows. We are now committed to reimbursing any credit accumulated over the year and to simplify the VAT system to reinforce its neutrality. A second problem addressed concerns the extension of payment periods, which generated additional costs for companies. We have set up an observatory of payment periods and created an electronic platform dedicated to processing complaints from suppliers of public establishments and companies. These efforts have led to a significant reduction in the time taken for public procurement contracts, which now only takes 35 days, as compared to 80 days previously. For public companies and establishments, the average payment period decreased as well, taking only 48.7 days in September 2019 instead of 78 days in 2017. Regarding access to financing for businesses, and more particularly for SMEs and very small enterprises (VSE), we recently launched an integrated business support and financing program. This program, which is the result of several meetings and working sessions with the central bank and commercial banks, is focused on three major axes: the financing of entrepreneurship, the coordination of actions in support for entrepreneurship at regional level and financial inclusion in rural areas. A number of concrete measures have also been taken in order to support This project in particular the disposal of personal guarantees, the reduction of credit costs with a preferential interest rate of 2% in urban areas and 1.75% in rural areas and the creation of a special allocation account “Fund dedicated to financing entrepreneurship" within the framework of the 2020 finance law. A committee responsible for coordinating and monitoring the execution of parent measures for entrepreneurial support will soon be created." We have also adopted a National Financial Inclusion Strategy which aims to integrate into the financial system, in addition to the rural populations targeted by the funding support program, populations who have difficulty accessing financial services, such as youth, women, and VSEs. These devices are accompanied by other financial mechanisms, notably collaborative funding or "crowdfunding", which aims to ensure new sources of financing for SMEs and young innovative project leaders.</p><h4>Despite global turmoil, Morocco's economic growth remains constant. What are its key drivers?</h4><p>Indeed, despite global market outlooks and a reoccurring drought for several years, GDP growth has averaged nearly 4% since 2008. This performance is the result of the increased diversification of our productive base through integrated sectorial policies. For example, the Green Morocco plan has made our agriculture less dependent on the vagaries of the climate by developing new, high value-added sectors. Meanwhile, the Industrial Acceleration plan has encouraged the emergence of new export sectors with higher technological content, notably in the automotive, offshore, aeronautics, and electronics sectors.<br>As such, automotive production reached 402,000 units in 2018, as compared to 10,000 vehicles in 2004, with a local integration level of more than 50% and a market share of nearly 40% at the level of the African continent. And in order to reduce our energy dependency, we have made significant progress in renewable energy programs, raising the share of renewable energy to around 34% of installed electrical power, with a 2030 target of 52%.</p><h4>What is the impact of the port of Tanger Med and its respective extension on the Moroccan economy?</h4><p>An open and competitive economy would not be possible without the development of substantial infrastructure and an efficient supply base. We have built, in a short time, 1,800km of highways, ports, and integrated industrial zones to make of our proximity to Europe a real competitive advantage and fully exploit our strategic position as a gateway to Africa.<br>The Tangier Med complex is an industrial platform for more than 900 companies representing an annual business volume of MAD80 million in the automotive, aeronautics, logistics, textiles, and trade sectors. The dynamic activity around this port has contributed to improve the performance of the Moroccan economy by making Morocco an attractive destination for international investments and by positioning the country as a regional hub for the production and export of goods and services to the global market.</p><h4>Reducing debt and public spending and balancing the deficit are among the objectives of the new finance bill. How will the government ensure the achievement of these objectives?</h4><p>The maintenance of macroeconomic balances is the subject of continuous efforts to control expenditure, improve the yield of tax revenues, and mobilize non-tax revenues. Thus, within the framework of the 2020 budget bill, we are going to pursue these efforts through rationalization of public expenditure; improving the efficiency of investment expenditure; increasing the mobilization of tax and customs revenues; improving the governance and transparency of public institutions and companies; and introducing new financing mechanisms to reduce the treasury's debt. Simultaneously, the government has committed itself to pursuing structural reforms to strengthen its productive base and making it possible to control budget deficit and sustain growth, thereby reducing recourse to debt. These reforms will focus on a tax reform that will recommend a framework for the next five years; implementing provisions of an organic budget law and strengthening the correlation between performance and evaluation and accountability principles; implementing a new approach to the management of public investment projects; insuring that investment projects are chosen on the basis of their social and economic impact; and the pension system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does Urban Shelter do?<br></strong>Urban Shelter is a real estate developer in Nigeria with over 27 years of experience in project conceptualization, management, and delivery. We are one of the few real estate companies in Nigeria that covers the whole spectrum of real estate development. Our focus ranges from affordable housing to high-end homes, as well as retail and commercial. Our residential ranges from USD12,000-750,000. Geographical spread is also important to the company; we have six live projects in Abuja, one in Kaduna State, two in Niger State, and two in Lagos State. In 2020, we hope to launch in Enugu State and Kano State.</p><p><strong>What makes affordable housing attractive to you, and how do you balance cost and quality?<br></strong>Volume is key. We are not in business of making money; putting people in homes is our passion.  Scale is important when developing affordable homes. The planning and development stages of a project is a labor of love, from the concept and architectural design to green tech and prop tech solutions, and so on. We would prefer to build 500 homes instead of 50. There has never been a project where the infrastructure is there already. We bring expertise in for power lines, water lines, sewage lines, and roads. That volume means that you have shared costs without diminishing returns. Rather than build a 2-km road for one house that costs NGN200 million to build, I would build that 2-km road and construct 500 homes for NGN5 million.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about how mortgages work in Nigeria?<br></strong>Nigeria faces a challenge when it comes to mortgages. Mortgage services are limited, given the volume of demand. There have been some key institutions at the forefront of championing mortgage provision, including the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) and the Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC). Mortgages make up less than 1% of GDP. Internationally, the mortgage market is the driver for housing construction and economic growth. FMBN rates are at 6%, which is accessible for any Nigerian contributing to the National Housing Fund (NHF). However, application and approval times can be protracted, while non-subsidized rates can vary from 20-27%. Part of our challenge is to make affordable homes more accessible to individuals. So, we devised a five-year repayment plan. Most developers do a one-year payback plan, with some doing an 18-month or two-year plan.  Furthermore, clients can move in 30 months after the date of their first payment and pay the balance while occupying their homes. In 2018, Urban Shelter signed an agreement with NMRC that will effectively allow it to re-mortgage clients under the five-year payment plan. It is immensely gratifying to be able to provide financial tools and options for Nigerians to get a step on the property ladder.</p><p><strong>How can Nigeria improve the situation?<br></strong>We need to improve the Nigerian macro-economy in which we operate, live, and do business.  Improving macroeconomic indicators means falling interest rates; what typically stops clients from getting into the mortgage market is high mortgage rates in the 20s. If inflation is already in the double digits, the market free rate is also going to be high. Interbank lending rates will be at double digits, around 13-14%. Money becomes too expensive. You also have situations where mortgage banks themselves are borrowing from commercial banks, which are also facing financial risks. Recently, inflation has gone down to low digits. That is a good sign, as is increasing political stability following elections earlier in 2019. We hopefully should see a cascading effect where other rates will fall and indicators improve. Eventually, that will reduce mortgage rates. The mortgage market also needs more liquidity, which the Family Homes Fund will help to address.  Concrete intervention in the housing and mortgage market must be made. Examples can be found in Singapore and even Mexico. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[making-houses-into-homes]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>What was the starting point of Landmark, and how did you become a leader today?<br>Landmark Corporate Reality was created to bridge a housing gap. Real estate developers were performing below international standards in terms of quality. Another factor is the government's  failure when it comes to housing. In other developing countries, governments have intervened in the real estate sector. However, in Nigeria, the government is neither helping nor contributing. As a result, it is up to the private sector meet the shortfall. Companies come here, build low-quality buildings, and then leave. People also lack a vehicle for complaint. I did research and wanted to bridge the gap among low-, medium-, and high-income housing. Once people have adequate shelter, other social advances become possible.</p><p><strong>How did you raise the funds to start these operations?<br></strong>Raising capital was difficult, as financial institutions charge double-digit rates on loans. How can you provide accommodation when taking out a double-digit loan? The price of the property would be too high. I started small with some friends, eventually moving to our own office after having seen gradual growth. We started with six apartments, and then one acre; before we knew it, we were creating large estates, all without government backing. We revert to borrowing money from banks, but today we are still essentially floated on internal equity and have become a large company. To date, we have provided housing for over 1,500 people who pay over a six-month period.</p><p><strong>What major projects are you working on now, and what is in the pipeline?<br></strong>We have several major projects right now. One major project is in Lekki Skim and has a value of NAR10 billion. For 2Q2020, we will be introducing another major project, the Quart Lansing project, a 25-story high rise featuring offices and apartments. The architect is from Dubai, and we are still working on designs. The project will be affordable luxury. Though we are increasingly targeting high-net-worth individuals, we are still working to address the housing crisis. We notice that many people are coming to work from the mainland to the island. We are trying to solve this issue whereby people can live and work in the same place. Lagos is on its way to becoming the second-largest city in the world. We have to plan ahead to cater to the population as there is not much available land in Lagos. Therefore, we are focusing on using the full potential of the land by building high rises. However, we do not want to pass our projects off to consumers at high cost.</p><p><strong>Is it profitable to target the low and middle class?<br></strong>It is profitable, but we are not here simply to maximize profits. We prefer to find a profit point where we can still provide housing for middle-class people in a win-win scenario. The more projects we do in different areas the more people will buy.</p><p><strong>How do you find the sector in terms of competition?<br></strong>Indigenous companies are on the rise, as is competition. However, Landmark is not focused on its competition. For us, there are two real estate companies: Landmark and the rest. We are focused on affordable housing and bridging that gap.</p><p><strong>What is the pace of change in bridging this housing gap?<br></strong>With time, high costs and poorly constructed houses will be phased out. There will be serious massive developments, and people will embrace what Landmark is doing. We want Lagos to be one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and we have a positive outlook on the industry.</p><p><strong>What are your key priorities for the year ahead?<br></strong>For 2020, my priorities are for every individual to own a house and have a shelter overhead. We want to solve the housing deficit and take people out of these uninhabitable accommodations. We want to solve the housing deficit in Nigeria, and I am optimistic we will get there. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What updates to the Eko Atlantic project have there been in the last year?<br></strong>Over the past year, Eko Atlantic has progressed substantially. We have real estate developments being completed by our clients and also have clients who have submitted plans for future construction. There are buildings breaking ground for construction in 2020, and several buildings are currently in the final approval processes for development. We are also proud that this past year, while working with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), we have been able to achieve Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE) certification for one of our client's existing developments. As Eko Atlantic infrastructure is already operational, residents and businesses alike have taken occupancy. The city has further become an attractive option for corporations to establish their headquarters, and developers to conduct due diligence for future development. Since Eko Atlantic is a free zone, our goal is to become a financial and commercial free zone and a financial center for sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, we intend to establish Eko Atlantic City as a major tourist attraction in Lagos and Nigeria. In the coming year, we will open our marina, which will be pedestrian-friendly and surrounded by shops and restaurants. The first restaurant in Eko Atlantic City opened over a year ago, and the second restaurant launched in December 2019. All these are important milestones for us</p><p><strong>How do you contribute to local content, particularly through job creation for the Nigerian population and indigenous companies?<br></strong>We are an indigenous company, and most of the engineering works are executed in-house or by contracting companies, which are all Nigerian. It is our strict policy to manufacture or procure as many of our supplies as possible from within Nigeria. We heavily push for local content. Consequently, we are able to maintain high standards while maintaining a cost-effective basis as we build this city.</p><p><strong>Since the beginning of 2018, what challenges have you encountered with the project?<br></strong>The country is emerging from an economic recession, resulting in a general slowdown in the real estate industry. The upward trajectory we are witnessing is a reflection of the growing demand for business-friendly infrastructure in terms of high-quality offices, housing, entertainment, hospitality, hotels, hospitals, and schools. Naturally, we are experiencing strong interest in these sectors within the city due to the numerous advantages it has to offer. Nevertheless, after a prolonged recession, we are experiencing a real estate market committed to making up for lost time. Eko Atlantic City is an infrastructure project developed to provide modern and efficient infrastructure facilities while simultaneously combating coastal erosion. Already established within the city is a considerable portion of the infrastructure network including the road network, water distribution, wastewater treatment, fiber optic network, and electrical distribution. We are constantly developing innovative and cost-effective solutions to sustainably service our city for generations to come.</p><p><strong>What are your key priorities for 2020 with the Eko Atlantic project?<br></strong>We are focused on developing Eko Atlantic City as a green city. One way we're achieving this is by working with IFC, which has an EDGE certification. This certification helps developers identify cost-effective ways to reduce the resource, energy, and water consumption needs for their buildings and, at the same time, lower their overall carbon footprint. By encouraging our developers to work with environmentally friendly materials and utilize energy-efficient designs, we will have a higher percentage of green buildings within Eko Atlantic, which could become a new benchmark for city building around the world. Therefore, Lagos and Nigeria, through adopting EDGE certification and international standards for developments in Eko Atlantic City, are joining the world in creating a green new city. This is our ambition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Could you walk us through the background of the company since its operations began in Nigeria? <br></strong>We turned four recently and thus reflected on and reviewed our journey so far. It has been a journey of many experiences. When we started this business, there was no template or prototype for us to piggyback on. We had to build a 360-degree, Pan-African creative agency from scratch. In retrospect, this allowed us to start with a clean slate and with no preconceived notions or prejudices. We knew what solutions we set out to provide in a peculiar industry populated by young talented and creative people. Our goal is to manage and represent the best among this pool, optimize them, and make them compete in the global marketplace</p><p><strong>The steady rise of Nigeria's event industry has increased competition in the country. What is the company's competitive advantage?</strong><br>It is important to note that the events or 'live' aspect is just one arm of what we do. We have other divisions in film, music, sports, art, and digital. Our competitive advantage and business strategies are quite aligned and uniform across all divisions. We place the needs of clients at the forefront of all we do. In order to do this, we have had to take great ownership of the value chain. Rather than waiting for the phones to ring, we are being proactive and create packages around our unique talents. We can create content, produce, record, design pitches, and marry the worlds of the creative and the commercial. This gives our clients greater visibility and leverage in an increasingly competitive field.<br> <br><strong>How does the company contribute to the local industry and set new standards in the Nigerian and African talent industry?<br></strong>Everything we have done has been built on local talent and showcasing the best and brightest of Africa, whether through our staff or the people we represent. As a youth-centric organization, we are keen on tapping into the biggest demographic in Africa and ensuring we understand their peculiar demands, trends, and norms. Theirs is a language we speak fluently. <br> <br><strong>How can the entertainment industry in Nigeria contribute to boosting other sectors, such as tourism?<br></strong>The boost in tourism is already happening before our very eyes. Many artists and actors already have a pan-African and global appeal. We now have a concert season every December where people come from far and wide to be in Lagos. Film crews from all across Africa and the world are coming to Nigeria to shoot on location, to cast, and for post-production. Capacity and skills are improving all the time, and Africa is a match for anyone in the world.<br> <br><strong>What are your plans and key priorities for the year 2020?<br></strong>2020 has obviously made for a most unexpected start, and every business' strategy has had to take a back seat to more globally expedient matters. What the COVID-19 pandemic reminds us, however, is that no industry, nation, or continent operates in a vacuum. We are far more connected than we could have imagined. Interestingly, this was the very foundation of what Temple's priorities are going forward. We seek to become bridge builders primarily between the vast spectrum of African talents, but also across the globe. For too long, we in Africa have not valued our stories, culture, and heritage, which are all invariably rich in artistry and beauty. As a result, we have been exploited at every turn, and we rarely get the commensurate worth of our abilities. In 2020, we will launch Ogidi Studios by Temple, a state-of-the-art audio and visual production facility that houses live-action and music recording studios, along with post-production, photography, and VFX suites. This puts us firmly in control of the stories we are putting out there. The narrative is changing, and Temple is here for that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are AELEX's key areas of business in Nigeria today?<br></strong>The most active are disputes, which include arbitration and tax litigation. We also cover M&amp;As, which are particularly busy. In 2019, we closed on a couple of interesting transactions. There was one involving The Coca-Cola Company acquiring a local juice manufacturer, which took about three years to close. We also worked for a PE firm that was acquiring assets from another such firm. In our firm, the number of lawyers has grown. A year ago, we had nine partners, while now we have 11. We also have more associates. We hope the economy continues to grow to help us sustain our current size.</p><p><strong>How do you remain competitive in a field where there is not much specialization?<br></strong>You start by looking at the clients you provide services to, as opposed to what practice area you want to be active in. Different clients have different needs, and they avail themselves of the firms that best service those. In order to service clients, I need the full complement of skills and services. You are not always just selling a certain service, but a package of services. There are areas of strength, and in these areas, we can differentiate ourselves. We have a reputation in certain areas, which we can leverage to sell those services and familiarize our clients with the general quality of our offering. Corporate relationships allow us to offer numerous services across many service areas.</p><p><strong>What involvement has AELEX had in the entertainment industry to date, and what sectors offer greater business potential for law firms tomorrow?</strong><br>We have had some involvement through deals in television, for example. Entertainment is an area that requires much thought about potential clients. Providing services to corporations is different from providing them to the individual, because the corporation has layers to deal with. With an individual, you have to do a bit more hand holding. Our clients are more corporations than individuals, but individuals in entertainment are making the money. We have to get them to appreciate that there is value in our services.</p><p><strong>What would you recommend producers, musicians, and artists do in Nigeria to protect their intellectual property?<br></strong>People need to understand that protecting intellectual property is worth their while. Copyrights are particularly important for the arts, and protecting it when someone infringes on it requires money to challenge it. In many countries, there are collecting societies that act on behalf of artists. Artists join a collecting society and its task is to discover who is violating copyrights and then challenge those individuals or corporations. The collecting societies in Nigeria have challenged major companies for using property they have not paid for. This is one way to protect these rights, but people need to understand the importance of this. Bit by bit, the knowledge and structure is being developed to better protect these rights across the industry. In Nigeria, every artist seems to think that they should set up their own recording company, and this means that it is difficult to aggregate. We have not seen this critical mass develop yet. If you get big enough, you can have enough cash to invest in smaller players or artists when they are still in their infancy. The absence of this keeps the industry from really developing.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for 2020?<br></strong>At the end of the day, we are service providers. Someone has to want what we are selling. Companies must be doing business and needing legal services for us to continue flourishing. If the economy is not doing so well, then fewer people will be doing business or looking for legal services. This year, we are hoping that election uncertainty will have passed, and we will be able to look forward to a clearer picture. There is more clarity concerning budgets, so we hope there will be more funds available to finance activity, which will translate into greater stability and opportunity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the business environment and the investment climate in Nigeria?<br></strong>I am cautiously optimistic. A number of cabinet members were retained in key offices post-election, which is a sign of stability. What businesses thrive on is stability and consistency, so we can plan better. So, we expect a continuity of policies overall into the new year. One of the reasons for optimism is the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), which has gone to great lengths to orchestrate new behaviors in the banking and financial market that will help the real sector. When the central bank insists on banks meeting the loan deposit ratio and putting deadlines, more money will flow into the real sector, which can help propel the desired growth. Nigeria however, continues to face a number of pressures, like the minimum wage issue and the ability to meet those obligations, the volatility in oil prices and how that impacts fiscal policies, and the direction of inflation and exchange rate. As a result of all that, there is reason to be cautious with that optimism. Indeed, looking at the competitiveness of the Nigerian market, the level of confidence needs to improve.</p><p><strong>How has your investments in the power sector offset the decline in the growth?<br></strong>The power sector is faced with many challenges. Restoring the implementation of unbundling the power holding company into generation companies (genco), distribution companies (discos), and transmission companies was fraught with difficulties. In the genco space, where we operate, we lead the advocacy charge and seek to bring the changes we feel are necessary. Not until we deal with these value chain issues will we see the level of growth necessary to orchestrate the development that we need in Nigeria. For us in thermal power, we basically make power from gas, and gas becomes the first spot of call when we talk about losses. Our losses as a result of gas issues are many, and the majority of issues border on commercial issues and pipeline security issues. Commercial issues are a major part. We are expected to pay USD2.50 for gas, whereas gas suppliers have demands for their gas ranging from USD5 to USD7. Why should they sell to me when they can sell it elsewhere for more money? On a positive note, we took two steps in 2019. First, we engaged with stakeholders and ensured we are guaranteed minimum gas volumes. Second, we moved to activate our gas equipment. We will have sufficient gas in the long run to power our assets, so we are not worried about the future. If there are issues, they will be temporary, because we have the ability to control these issues as long as we can produce and generate our own gas. The bulk of the technical issues are around funding.</p><p><strong>Can you expand on the hospitality sector?<br></strong>For the hospitality sector, what is crucial is we continue to enjoy enormous loyalty from our guests. We remain, undoubtedly, the best brand in Nigeria in this space. We have continued to win global, regional, and local awards. As a matter of fact, we were recognized as the leading business hotel in Africa for the fourth year running by the World Travel Awards. Occupancy level has been strong. There are still more business travelers than leisure travelers, and it will remain that way until we can do more in terms of improving the infrastructure for tourism in Nigeria. If we do not deal with perceptions, confidence, and security, it will be difficult for us to promote tourism. The government needs to make certain infrastructure available and team up with the private sector to build this infrastructure. Furthermore, certain policies and incentives must be implemented. Even traditional products like historical sites and museums are not in conditions to compete. That is what is lacking for leisure travel to improve.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you see UK debt relief and humanitarian aid efforts developing in Africa as a result of the COVID-19 situation?<br></strong>The UK is a large donor into Africa, and what we have seen over the last few years is a much closer coordination across the UK governments various arms where we seek to get maximum impact from working collectively. In the context of COVID-19, such alignment is more essential that ever, and we are seeing that not just within the UK government's aid efforts but also across all DFIs and even into the private-sector investment community as well. In the UK, as part of the immediate response to the pandemic, we have taken a wholesale look across all of our programming work in Africa and ensure that as much of that as possible is directed to provide the help and support that the governments across Africa are in need of to help them respond to the pandemic and also to put in place the building blocks for a strong recovery. People are talking about rebuilding better and building back greener, more sustainably, and more inclusively. That is essentially the focus for us, which is making sure that every pound and penny counts to help Africa's governments and people recover from the pandemic.</p><p><strong>How do you see the UK-Nigeria relationship developing?<br></strong>Nigeria is not the only one that is keen to boost trade, because the UK is as well. The story of Nigeria and its sheer size and scale makes it an essential partner in Africa. It is so dynamic and energetic, and the innovations we see on every street corner in Lagos are inspiring and makes you want to work together. We have had a great business relationship with Nigeria for a number of years, and not just in terms of oil and gas, although that has been a dominant feature. There has been GPB4.5 billion worth of trade between our countries year on year. Over this last year, we saw nearly a half billion worth of new business from the UK into Nigeria. We have worked hard to bring those opportunities to the UK business community. At the end of 2019, we did a Nigeria investment showcase in London, for example, with the Lord Mayor of London and packed the room with UK investors who are interested and excited to hear from Nigerians about the opportunities. We have a great relationship at the government-to-government level and across business levels. The Nigerian government has ambitions to diversify its energy mix in the next 10 years, so we see real opportunities in the renewables space as well. We have exciting deals happening around that in terms of solar energy and other areas. Agriculture is another area of growth, and we see education as an extraordinary sector as well given the size of its population and the ambition and drive of Nigerians. We have had fantastic conversations around education and skills training.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy to boost confidence for investors and UK companies that want to enter the market in Africa?<br></strong>According to traditional investors such as Unilever and Diageo, which have operations on the ground, times are tough, as they are around the world, but everyone is committed to Africa and committed to doing the right thing in terms of helping in that response phase and being part of the recovery phase. The way that we see UK investments across Africa really plays into what the strengths will be for that recovery phase. We are seeing people coming to terms with the new reality. We are seeing and hearing from companies that are interested in the opportunities that will emerge in Africa, whether that is in terms of mergers and acquisitions, business restructuring, or companies that were previously vibrant and dynamic but are perhaps just cash strapped and looking for investment. We will see a return of some of that investment that has flooded particularly out of sub-Saharan Africa in the last few months. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What services do you provide to hotels?<br></strong>We do feasibility studies to analyze the market. We look at what hotel guests want and how much they are willing to pay for each product. From that, we can calculate how much profit can be made. Once we are past that stage, we devise and implement a strategy for the branding and management of the new hotel, if that is the appropriate route to take. In addition, we assist in the design process of new hotels, working with the design team and the chosen brand to “get it done."</p><p><strong>What are some of the trends that are shaping Nigeria's hospitality sector?<br></strong>The hospitality sector was not well-developed up until 15 years ago. As trust and confidence in the government and economy increased, more local investors decided to invest in the hospitality and tourism sectors, in particular hotels and restaurants. Since then, the quality of services and products has continued to improve. Moreover, several international hotel chains entered the market and raised the bar. The arrival of international hotel chains is why independent hotels are now in great shape, as they are now seeking to emulate the branded offerings.</p><p><strong>Can you break down the tourism sector for us? <br></strong>Apart from some exceptions, domestic tourists represent the biggest segment of the market. Some 90% of guests in hotels in Lagos are Nigerians. Unlike some other countries, hotels in Nigeria charge the same price to domestic and international tourists. Moreover, the tourism industry can only really access finance from local banks. Due to the volatile nature of the Nigerian naira, it is hard to get and service loans from international banks. For example, the former InterContinental Lagos hotel was financed with USD-denominated loans from local banks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What strategies is Regno Media carrying out in order to stay ahead of competition?<br></strong>Regno Media's strategy to stay ahead of competition is a targeted yet passionate approach that encompasses a combination of factors such as research, excellent customer relations management, and timely service delivery. Our passion for advertising dictates innovations in the technology we deploy, our relationship management style, and our market intelligence approach, all with the aim of ensuring our customers' maximum satisfaction.</p><p><strong>How has Nigeria's digital wave affected Regno Media, particularly through its LED screen and digital billboards, and which of your platforms are currently most on demand?</strong><br>The digital economy has helped to raise the bar in the digital out-of-home advertising industry. Regno Media is not left out in the competition, as it has a reasonable number of both digital and static billboards in strategic locations that are much sought after. Demand for both platforms have been high. While our static boards can only accommodate one brand at a time, our digital boards have allowed  us to accommodate multiple brands and increase revenues at the same time.</p><p><strong>What added value specific to Regno Media do you provide to your clients, and how do you maintain your loyal customer base?</strong><br>We provide our clients with advisory services and suggest strategic locations that delivers their messages to their audience. We provide efficient delivery services at competitive prices without compromising on the quality of work that we deliver. With all this on offer, our existing customers have remained loyal, and we have seen a steady increase in new clients.</p><p><strong>Between 2018 and 2020, advertising dollars in Nigeria has grown and is devoted to TV and video promotion. What opportunities does this present to businesses like Regno Media?</strong><br>The perceived rise in TV and video promotion dollar spends can be complemented and made more effective by leveraging other platforms such as social media, out-of-home media, and so on, thereby creating opportunities for Regno Media in the out-of-home industry.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations and key priorities for 2020?<br></strong>We have begun to see a gradual increase in spending in the economy. Businesses are again turning their focus to marketing and are increasing their budgets for this. We expect there to be an increase in revenue and hoardings in 2020. The company's priorities are to work in tandem with our existing customers in order to better serve them and gather market intelligence in order to convert our prospects with ease.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the impact of COVID-19 on your operations and decision-making, and how is the confederation reacting to the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic?</h4><p>The confederation is heavily involved in all of the discussions with the government. During this crisis, we have been in greater contact with the different entities so that we can bring our point of view on the decisions that have been made. There are three main impacts from the crisis: sanitary, social, and economic. We are involved in the social and economic sides through an entity that has been created with ministers, parts of the government, the government body of banks, and CGEM. This is where decisions are being made on the social and economic sides. From that perspective, we are heavily involved; it is almost a full-time job on that front. That is our impact. Many measures to help the private sector and its workers, as well as those in the formal economy, have emerged from this. That is where we are acting the most in this crisis.</p><h4>CGEM conducted an investigation of the economic repercussions of the pandemic and surveyed 1,820 companies on their expectations of payment periods post COVID-19. How were these results?</h4><p>The results show that the crisis is deep and impacting everyone in all sectors. Another thing we learned is that about one-third of people are not working. That is a massive number. The third message we got from the survey is that nearly all companies are in a difficult situation; out of 33 sectors, 28 sectors are declaring falls in revenues of more than 25%. The second part of the study allowed us to test how the private sector has accepted our measures in our government body between the government, CGEM, and the banks. In total, two-thirds of the companies have used the measures, while all of the measures have been used by roughly half of the companies. This means the measures that have been taken have been extremely helpful for the sector. The last thing the study showed was that payment delays have increased by more than 60 days as a result of the crisis. That's a huge problem worldwide, and it suggests that the economy will fall everywhere around the world. If people cannot pay, companies will go bankrupt.</p><h4>Which sectors have been most affected?</h4><p>Getting back to normal is extremely important as the base for GDP growth and revealing the sectors that can bounce back first. Today, industry is a strong sector for Morocco because it is starting up with a relocation and redistribution of demand and the offer. Not everything will be made in China anymore, and we anticipate more industry spreading out to different countries. There will be opportunities everywhere. Morocco has done a fantastic job in showing that it has a strong industry in the aeronautics and automotive sectors. We were strong in textiles and clothing as well, but also in others. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, has potential. We have a base and are close to and friendly with Europe. Most likely, we have a role to play to be an alternative to the European market in terms of supplying industrial products. I would not bet on tourism in the short term, however.</p><h4>What are your priorities and goals for the year ahead?</h4><p>As a confederation of entrepreneurs, our goal is to save as many companies and as much employment as possible. We need to protect our supply. That means protecting our people and our companies. At the same time, we need to be realistic and understand that we cannot stay at home forever. We need to do it, but also keep in mind other safety measures that can be taken in this situation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has the company continued to strengthen its portfolio last year?</h4><p>In 2019, we entered new therapeutic areas, where for example we are set to start an interesting new psychiatric protocol. We are close to starting with vaccines as well. The vaccine protocols are different from what we usually do. Normally, there is phase one with volunteers, phase two with a small number of ill patients with low doses, and phase three with more patients to measure security and efficacy, and phase four for pharmacovigilance. Vaccines have different phases as with all clinical trials, but for phase four of a vaccine trial you need a high volume of patients for testing. There are three studies in the pipeline and it is an area in which we will strengthen out presence going forward. We are working on a vaccine for syncytial virus (RSV) in seniors and children, and we are also working on a vaccine for pregnant women.</p><h4>How would you compare the company's results in 2019 to those of 2018?</h4><p>2019 was full of uncertainty, and slower performance than in 2018. The new administration changed many things, for example requiring a whole three-month period to issue medicine permits, where the previous administration had delivered in half that time. In fact, in 2019 pharmaceutical companies actually decided to work abroad given the approval time in Mexico.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the decision of the new administration to modify the public healthcare system?</h4><p>The issue is implementation. It looks great on paper, but in reality, you do not know how it is going to work. The public health system was already chaotic and problematic. In my opinion, it is a great proposal, but we have to see if it will work in practice. There is a shortage of specialist physicians as it is, and doctors do not want to work in the public system.</p><h4>We have heard of many changes in the government's process of selecting medicines for the public health system. What is your opinion on these changes?</h4><p>It is good that the government is trying to reduce monopolies in the health care industry, although I do not think they should use generic medicines brought from India and China. We know within the industry that these medicines do not undergo the same quality processes as in Mexico. This is an ongoing issue that yet to be solved. I agree that costs should decline, just not at the cost of quality, efficacy, and safety.</p><h4>In terms of clinical research, what are your perspectives on the growth of the industry in Mexico?</h4><p>There are great opportunities, but these have always stalled due to regulatory obstacles. What we have, similar to Brazil, is a situation where it takes around three to six months to start a project. Yet, when we need to recruit patients, we do so better than other countries, thereby mitigating this with high turnout rates; however, companies would prefer a more stable regulatory setting. The government is also changing the customs regime, and we have to import medicines and supplies, which today requires a different process. In terms of global ranking, Mexico has not advanced.</p><h4>Which countries compete with Mexico in this aspect in Latin America?</h4><p>Permit approval times are rather similar. Colombia is undergoing some reforms in terms of clinical research, but not everybody there wants to undertake research. The main players are Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. Chile and Peru are also players, but not as notable.</p><h4>What are your growth goals for 2020?</h4><p>Growth will be at around 20% for most projects, and the number of specialists will also rise. And meanwhile, we are undergoing an internal restructuring, and will focus on quality control. 2020 looks like a promising year, where we have been nominated for an international business award for reliability. There are many clinical research centers in operation, but they do not operate as companies, but rather as small clinics that provide consultations. We are one of the few that has a control board and strategic planning. Of those businesses 80% are run by doctors, who have very different visions. You need to set up your locations in close proximity to patients, and we have many in Estado de Mexico, were we have located close by. There are also plans to use telemedicine in conjunction with actual patient visits. We will also open for business in Querétaro around June where we will focus on training and patient consultation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What make Morocco a good destination for investment?</h4><p><span></span>Morocco's political and economic stability is the number-one reason why investors choose it over other countries. The Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, which gives us stability and a very clear short and long-term vision. All the necessary short-term strategies are put in place, including sectorial strategies and ministerial strategies, to oversee the yearly performance of programs and initiatives. Then there are long-term strategies that are guaranteed by the monarchy. For instance, it is not possible for a new government to easily make changes to the tax regime. This guarantees stability to investors. This stability has wide-ranging effects on the overall economy, including macroeconomic indicators and the exchange rate. Furthermore, Morocco has state-of-the-art infrastructure, a key geographical location, and FTAs that give access to more than 1.3 billion consumers in 56 countries. We have also recently signed agreements with several African countries and we have ratified in 2019 the establishment of the new African Free Trade Zone (AFTZ), on top of all this, Moroccan offers highly skilled and talented human resources.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities for Moroccan exporters?</h4><p><span></span>We strongly believe there are opportunities to be found in any crisis so we must be ready to seize and track them anytime and anywhere. According to several reports and analysis, the current situation brings as many challenges as hopes and opportunities. Indeed, the consequences of the coronavirus crisis have resulted in a global reshaping of value chains all over the world and in particular in the Mediterranean region. This is particularly the case for the European Union, which may begin soon to review some of its positions and economic alliances on the international stage. Pressed to reconsider its production plants locations and its subcontractors and providers proximity, the EU could think of reestablish its existing model of the automotive or even aeronautics in other sectors of activity. Here too, Morocco continues to claim a number of advantages for European operators. Despite a quite higher production costs than in other Asian countries, the Kingdom offers unbeatable geographic proximity and logistical efficiency. In addition, thanks to its very extensive network of free trade agreements (Direct access to more than 1.3 billion consumers in 56 countries), Morocco presents itself as a re-export platform to several other countries and continents. In addition, the Moroccan government offers technical and financial support as well as tax exemptions for the set-up of foreign investors, not to mention its highly specialized and equipped industrial acceleration zones. This new approach will also involve linking our objectives with those of our partners, to ensure joint and sustainable development and growth. Another main point is recommending and identifying the tools together, which will combine foreign investment in Morocco, national investment and the development of the Made in Morocco export. Furthermore, this unprecedented epidemic could undoubtedly offer one of the main cross-border collaboration beneficiaries for Morocco; accelerate a major global process: “near shoring". Indeed, in recent years, many multinationals have been studying different options, allowing them to reduce the dependency between their production chains and the economies fluctuations and uncertainties of some geographically remote countries.</p><h4>What can be done to facilitate access to local markets?</h4><p><span></span>Although the current crisis, by benefiting from the wide range of FTAs concluded by Morocco in the last decades, AMDIE is daily collaborating with Moroccan economic operators, to suggest and design new tailor-made measures to the needs of exporting companies. These new roadmaps are made while considering the company's markets, products, and production capabilities. Beyond that AMDIE is working on giving investors the possibility of becoming permanent sustainable exporters, but these investors are still need assistance to approach the international contractors. The biggest challenge for us is closing this loop and to boost production through our industrial ecosystems, in order to grow up exports volumes and reach a national sectorial critical size. The second-biggest challenge is logistics. The Port of Tanger Med and the Nador Tangier West Med port are great additions, but Morocco's ambitions require more projects, and the government acknowledges this need and is developing new logistical solutions and innovative infrastructure. Moreover, due to the current international tendency of buying and sourcing online, easy accessing to national and international digital E-Commerce platforms, combined with a great ranking of the Made in Morocco Products, become undoubtedly a real weapon to boost our exports. Without forgetting the importance of the Moroccan breakthrough in terms of customs procedures. Actually, in 2019 the Moroccan Customs and Indirect Tax Administration announced the full digitalization of the customs procedures.</p><h4>How is the AMDIE helping SMEs?</h4><p><span></span>In the current economic crisis, AMDIE is accelerating its efforts to support Moroccan companies in their search for new niches for growth and international business performance. We are recommending and promoting diversification, adaptation and opening up to new business lines, as well as focusing on export added value. These new strategies can be a success leverages to remain productive and competitive on these harsh times. Our goal is to create an excellent ground for Moroccan businesses growth opportunities. If these capacities are acquired and implemented by SMEs, it could help to catch new deals and lower the risk of a potential shutdown. In June 2020, the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Green and Digital Economy has just launched a set of full support tools and programs dedicated to the Moroccan industrial SMEs. The objective is to give a strong boost to their growth and competitiveness. The current support programs have been reconfigured into two new programs with more attractive loan rates and simplified access and payment conditions. The two programs are “Istitmar" and “Mowakaba". The first one focuses on supporting investment in industrial small businesses, up to 30% of the investment program, whereas the “Mowakaba" program covers the cost of technical assistance and consulting for the benefit of industrial small and medium-sized businesses, with up to 80% for middle-sized businesses (instead of the current 70%) and 90% for the very small companies. That is not all: in addition to Istitmar and Mowakaba, two new created from scratch programs have been implemented. These are 'Tatwir' and 'Nawat'. The “Tatwir" program provides tailor-made support including both investment assistance and technical advisory services, for the benefit of industrial small businesses investing in growth sectors. As for the" Nawat" program, it provides support in terms of consulting, expertise and technical assistance for both very small businesses and self-entrepreneurs and project leaders, whose investments does not exceed 3 million of dirhams.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is NITDA's role in unfolding a government digital plan, and what effects will it have in enabling economic diversification?<br></strong>There was an urgent need to reposition the Nigerian ICT sector to harness digital technologies and create opportunities for Nigerians. In October 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari expanded the mandate of our supervisory ministry and re-designated it to the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy. This resonates with recent global trends. Countries around the world are investing hugely in building capacity to create value and prosperity in the digital economy. Our ministry and the leadership of my mentor and boss Ali Ibrahim has crafted National Digital Economy Strategy to drive digital transformation. NITDA, as a focal agency within the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, is responsible for setting regulations for our digital transition. We are also saddled with the responsibility for coordinating the digitalization of government services, stimulating indigenous innovation, and driving local content to prepare our citizens for the future of work and wealth creation in a digital age. We are setting the rules to ensure healthy competition in the provision of digital services in Nigeria. All this will lead to improved services to citizens and improved productivity through innovation and local content, thereby creating opportunities in the services sector that enable economic diversification.</p><p><strong>NITDA has restructured processes for registering and certifying domestic IT OEMs to ensure local manufacturers adhere to global best practice. What has been the evolution and response so far?</strong><br>The restructuring was aimed at improving the quality of our indigenous products as well as building a vibrant customer support culture. There were many companies on poor quality customer support services. Therefore, NITDA re-organized the process to ensure those who qualify meet the highest global standards for manufacturing. We want them to dominate the Nigerian market in particular and the African market in general. NITDA also included the need for ISO 9001 certification on quality manufacturing process. Some local OEMs have completed this process and received their full status as indigenous OEMs, and we are already receiving reports on improved quality. Overall, the process has been successful. We expect the remaining OEMs to comply and finish the process too, so that they can benefit from government policy on local content. And NITDA is enforcing MDAs to support them.</p><p><strong>What are NITDA's strategies behind the plan to deploy ICT centers in all state secretariats, and what are the benefits to be achieved by this?</strong><br>NITDA is investing in digital infrastructure to bridge digital gaps and promote digital society, literacy, skills, entrepreneurship, and inclusion. So far, 320 digital capacity training centers fully equipped with e-learning facilities, eight IT hubs, 12 digital libraries, four IT innovation and incubation parks, eight community IT training centers, and four capacity development centers have been deployed across the country, and more are coming. We will continue to make these investments until all Nigerians are digitally enabled.</p><p><strong>What is NITDA's assessment of the ICT sector's exponential growth in recent times and its future landscape in the country?</strong><br>The recent GDP numbers imply that ICT is currently the third-largest sector in Nigeria, even ahead of the oil and gas sector. The volume of economic activity in the ICT sector is enormous. The IT industry as a component of the ICT sector is the underlining infrastructure for banking, finance, and, increasingly, government services. IT innovation is also the leading area of early-stage capital and investments in Nigeria, with about USD178 million and USD148 million invested in the IT innovation space in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Therefore, the programs and policies of NITDA such as the Nigeria Cloud Computing Policy (NCCP), the Nigeria ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship Vision (NIIEV), and the Guidelines for Nigerian Content Development in ICT are all geared toward supporting the exponential growth of the IT industry as the leading industry for job and wealth creation. NITDA is currently working on e-commerce and outsourcing policies to further boost the IT landscape in Nigeria. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Along with Argentina and Ecuador, Nigeria is the only country that has twice had a national elected as president of the General Assembly. What does the UN expect from the Nigerian government in order to carry out its missions more effectively?</strong> <br>Nigeria is a strong believer in collaboration and multilateralism. Since joining the UN in 1960, Nigeria has worked constructively with other member states toward the achievement of the organization's goals. It has served many times on the Security Council and is an active member of numerous committees, including the special committee on peacekeeping operations. Today, Nigeria is among the most notable troop-contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions and has continuously demonstrated a readiness to contribute to international peace and security. In terms of the UN's expectations, the Nigerian government will continue in the same vein both within the international community as well as within the UN itself. Like other countries, Nigeria has high expectations of the UN. The organization needs to address a trust deficit in order to deepen partnerships and position multilateralism as the best way to confront the many challenges facing the international community. It needs to redouble efforts to bridge gaps and act for the common good of the people it serves, particularly as we prepare for the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the organization.</p><p><strong>The UN has played a key role in mitigating the effects of conflict in Nigeria. What is the assessment of the situation today, and what are the UN's strategies to fight these threats? </strong><br>The Nigerian government and its military have done a lot in the fight against insurgency and terrorism and have attained considerable gains. However, terrorist and criminal acts have led to the loss of life, considerable destruction of the northeastern part of the country and the Lake Chad area, as well as massive displacement of Nigerians both within and into neighboring countries. The UN's involvement in mitigating these effects is based on decisions made by the UN Security Council to support the states concerned in addressing the impact and threat on peace and security, including the political, socioeconomic, and humanitarian aspects. The UN also carries out field missions to strengthen support for affected countries. There is still a need to strengthen the UN Resident Coordinators to ensure the appropriate skills and capabilities needed have a maximum impact on the ground. The hope is that the 2020 Review of the UN Peacebuilding Architecture will enable the necessary environment to allow for more effective mitigation of the effects of crisis resilience.</p><p><strong>In 2020, the UN celebrates its 75th anniversary. What are the primary goals for your presidency of the General Assembly?<br></strong>As we look forward to the 75th anniversary of the founding of the organization, it is important to acknowledge not only the challenges that confront us, but also the opportunity for the UN as a multilateral institution to highlight its key role in tackling complex global problems. In my role as president of the 74th session, I will give special focus to promoting peace and security, with special emphasis on conflict prevention. Strengthening global action to tackle climate change is integral to the effective implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and will naturally receive my attention. I shall also give high priority to accentuating inclusion, human rights, and the empowerment of youth and women, respectively. Above all, my presidency will adopt measures to strengthen partnerships, especially those for the purpose of advancing Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty eradication, hunger, and quality education.</p><p><strong>How can Nigeria best improve the welfare of its people? <br></strong>By providing soft loans for women and youth to start small-scale businesses, access to free primary education, and investing in teacher education, we can eradicate poverty, reach zero hunger, and implement quality education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Would you give us some background of Visa's operations in Nigeria?<br></strong>Nigeria is a growing economy, and in a few years the Nigerian youth will be driving it, which is why it is important for Visa to be in the country. Our competition is cash, and in Nigeria the use of cash remains high. This presents a massive opportunity for us. People outside the financial system are cut off from getting credit and enjoying other benefits of the banking system. At Visa, we try to be that gateway. We have been operating in the country for over two decades. In that time, we have been able to connect businesses, merchants, individuals, banks, fintechs, and governments to the financial ecosystem.</p><p><strong>40% of Nigeria's adult population is still unbanked. What can Visa do with its stakeholders to help increase financial inclusion?<br></strong>The cashless drive in Nigeria started about 10 years ago. Although progress has been made, there is more to be covered. Furthermore, Lagos is not Nigeria. There are still massive cash flows in the eastern, northern, and western regions. At Visa, we think about the problem and the solution. We have focused on bringing innovative solutions to address some of these needs. We want to ensure that our solutions continue to generate trust and security for the consumer. We also need to ensure the process is seamless and easy to access and use.</p><p><strong>To what extent are the dominance of cash and the unbanked population limiting Visa's opportunities in Nigeria?<br></strong>We do not see it as a limitation but an opportunity. Visa assists banks in bringing in new solutions, helping them to achieve higher financial inclusion. Similarly, we engage with the government to collaborate to move cash payments onto electronic payment platforms. Therefore, a cash-based economy is not a problem but a massive opportunity for us because the potential for growth in such markets is much higher.</p><p><strong>What can Visa do to help improve cybersecurity for electronic transactions?<br></strong>Visa has systems in place to protect card holders. For claims, Visa works with the different parties involved and investigates to resolve the matter. We operate with a four-party model, where we have the issuer, the acquirer, the merchant, and the consumer. Therefore, at every point in time we are able to ensure confidence in that ecosystem. There will always be cybersecurity problems, but we invest heavily in security tools and continuously train our staff and partners to have the right tools, knowledge, and capabilities to authorize the right transactions. Making your payments via Visa is more secure because the process involves other parties, solutions, and security intelligence behind the scenes.</p><p><strong>In 2018, Lagos surpassed Nairobi as the venture capital leader in Africa, mostly in fintech. How is Visa looking to harness this growth?</strong><br>In 2018, we made an investment in Paystack, a payment aggregator. We have quite a number of strategic partnerships with other fintechs in Nigeria and West Africa. This has helped to increase our presence in the ecosystem. We have smaller fintech partners that have been able to create niche solutions for unique challenges. It makes it easier to work with different partners in these niche spaces. Fintech is able to study a particular segment and target audience and create the right solutions for them. What Visa brings onboard are the skills from working in over 200 countries and territories. Moreover, we have built a wide range of networks that fintechs can plug into. Visa has been operating for over 60 years so we understand how payments should be done as well as the challenges involved. We know the challenges of downtime, how to create back-end solutions, and how to build a real network. As a result, fintech partners gain by being able to leverage our experience and solutions. We help ensure they do not have to reinvent the wheel; all they have to do is provide a solution for a specific space and need. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does NIPC view the current investment landscape? What initiatives is the commission taking to attract investment to Nigeria?</strong><br>Although Nigeria has enjoyed 20 years of political stability, it went through a recession in 2016, from which it emerged cautiously in 2018. Numbers released by the National Bureau of Statistics show Nigeria grew 2.27% in 2019, which is below the targets laid out in the national economic plan. Fortunately, the government understands that a great deal of work needs to be done to get to the level of growth appropriate for an economy of Nigeria's size. The first thing investors look for is the attractiveness of the business opportunity, where the size of Nigeria's economy, population, and resources are a natural draw. Then, they consider the business environment, which is a challenging area the government is taking seriously. In line with this, we prepared an online guide for investors, the advantage of which is that it is easy to update and can be easily translated into several languages (and currently available in over 100). We also have a newsletter that goes out six days a week that covers all the positive developments taking place in Nigeria. We want not only foreigners but also more Nigerians to invest in the country. We considered five parameters, on the basis of which we came up with 20 strategically important countries. Our ultimate objective is to invite targeted investors from these countries to invest in Nigeria on the basis of the work and research we have done. In 2017, we put together a compendium of investment incentives to help investors understand the incentives to investing in Nigeria. We also looked at the federal government's investment treaty regime and Nigeria's investment agreements with other countries. We reviewed them and came up with recommendations on a country-by-country basis. We are also working on a number of sector profiles for the NIPC website that are part of our growing collection of investment profiles for all the different sectors in Nigeria.</p><p><strong>What sectors will continue growing in the years to come?<br></strong>Every sector in Nigeria has potential for growth because no single sector has developed to an extent that there are no further prospects for growth. The banking sector is one of the most sophisticated in Nigeria, and even in that sector there are pockets of growth. A large percentage of Nigerians is still unbanked, which explains why the fintech sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the country. The agriculture sector represents 23% of Nigeria's GDP, but a great deal can be done to further deepen it. One of the biggest challenges facing the sector is high post-harvest losses, which can be over 50% for some crops. We need to invest more in the preservation and processing of crops so that more Nigerians can eat what we produce. As for the creative and service industries, Nigeria has made a name for itself across the continent and beyond as Nigerian films and music continue to gain more popularity. The wealth of Nigeria's history and culture means there are several prospects for growth in these sectors.</p><p><strong>How can the PPP model facilitate investment in Nigeria?<br></strong>This model is necessary for the investor inflow we need, especially in infrastructure and public services. If you look at the government budget and available resources, it is clear there is not enough funding capacity from the government to drive the development of several sectors. This is where the PPP model comes in. It has worked in several markets, and it can be successful in Nigeria, too. So far, the best example of a PPP in Nigeria is Nigeria LNG Limited, which is the biggest corporate revenue generator for the government and demonstrates the endless possibilities on the horizon if we can get the PPP model right. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>One of your latest introductions into the market is Smooth &amp; Fast. Can you elaborate on how the product came into existence and its functionality for mobile users in the country?<br></strong>We established Smooth &amp; Fast Limited in 2019 as the sole distributor of Protection-Pro, the latest nano technology and global leader in on-demand screen protection for all types, both low and high-end mobile phones, tablets, smart watches, laptops, and so on. Developed and manufactured by Madico Inc. in the US, one of the world's leading manufacturers of innovative window film, coating, metallizing, and laminate solutions, Protection-Pro was launched in 2014, and we are excited and proud to introduce it to the Nigerian market as well as other countries in Africa. With the technology in hand, we can instantly produce and apply a Protection-Pro screen protector for any device in just two to three minutes. It is now available in major retailers and phone outlets in Lagos. We are in the process of expanding to cover other states in Nigeria. The technology and Protection-Pro are NASA approved and currently applied on all kinds of screens and devices.</p><p><strong>What opportunities are present in the Nigerian market that will encourage growth for Smooth &amp; Fast, and what are the benefits of your product for mobile phone users?</strong><br>Every smart device owner, whether used for business, social networking, or both, wants his device screen to be protected to the maximum; it is like protecting a small-scale investment. We all used to buy pre-cut, off-the-shelf tempered glass products and had to change it almost every month; these days are gone. We offer long-term protection, with no ugly, embarrassing, cracked, or shattered screens. All these users in the Nigerian market are potential customers; Protection-Pro serves the masses. Our application is cut-on-demand film and has more than 23,000 mobile designs built in, which means we can protect phones that are more than 10 years old all the way to the latest ones. We can have the design and cut of a newly launched device ready for our clients within 24 hours after launching, which is part of the support we get from the manufacturers, Madico Inc. US. The high-quality clear film is only 0.2mm thick, representing the slickest and smoothest shield on the market; strong and impact resistant; sensitive, maintaining screen responsiveness; flexible around curved edges; self-healing for minor scratches and abrasions; and available in both glossy and matte finishes.</p><p><strong>Mobile phone users are projected to grow to 34.3% of the population by 2023. Considering this, what strategies are you implementing to increase penetration and accessibility into the market and expand your consumer base?</strong><br>Smooth &amp; Fast's business module for Protection-Pro is designed to be retail friendly, and our goal is to reach and cover most retailers and mobile shops across Nigeria. The benefits of working with our brand for retailers are generating sales immediately, freeing shelf space, the availability of any design, on-demand simple inventory, and working with the leader in on-demand protection and the fastest design team in the business.</p><p><strong>What are Smooth &amp; Fast's key plans and priorities for 2020?<br></strong>We have clear and strong marketing strategies and plans to approach the rest of the Nigerian market, now that we have started in Lagos. Our ultimate goal is to see our outstanding product protecting as many smart devices out there as possible and to have a business presence in most retail and mobile shops nationwide and be the leader in the screen protection industry in Nigeria and Africa, just like other distributors are doing in other markets globally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What does Greensprings do differently from the other schools in Lagos?<br></strong>We offer a holistic education, but more importantly we are a community school. When you enroll your child into the Greensprings School, you become part of the community, where everyone takes responsibility for uplifting one another, especially the children. We stay true to our motto “In Love Serve One Another" and ensure this is reflected in everything we do. Previously, most of us grew up in environments where neighbors or relatives could discipline a child in the absence of their parents, with a sole aim of making him or her a better person in future. It reflects that saying “it takes a village to raise a child." This is even more relevant in today's society; therefore, we encourage parents' participation in school activities, because we want them to also be involved in the school life of their children. Our experience with our PTA community revealed that parents leverage these opportunities to network with one another and build long-lasting relationships. What makes us different as well is our ability to continuously innovate. In the last 35 years, we have recorded several outstanding milestones as a leading institution in the Nigerian education sector. Greensprings is the first school to adopt the Thinking Skills curriculum, which has further strengthened our goal of providing a well-rounded education. In 2017, Honour Olatunji, a Greensprings student, was awarded “Top in the World for Mathematics" in the IGCSE examination by British Council, along with other students who received “Top in The Country" awards in other subjects. Today, we have embarked on building state-of-the-art tech laboratories, which will allow our students to blend practice with theory and have engaging experiential learning. Nigerians continue to excel in education because we are interested in this sector and are known worldwide for our academic excellence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How did Bodyline establish its excellent reputation?<br></strong>Bodyline has existed for nine years, with its first outlet established in Abuja. Over the years, we saw a gap in the fitness industry, as there was growing awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle. We therefore wanted to create a space where fitness would be a way of life and not just a one-off activity. Based on our experience with the Abuja gym, we created an environment that encapsulates the entire well-being of an individual. Our gyms are one-stop shops for one's fitness needs. Besides the gym, all our locations are equipped with high-quality spas to cater to our clients' relaxation needs after a strenuous workout. We also run healthy restaurants in Ikoyi and Abuja to provide the option of a healthy, balanced meal at all times. Some of our locations host facilities for other sporting activities such as squash, lawn tennis, football, swimming, fitness classes, and more. All these have given us the much-needed edge to stand out from the crowd. What makes us special is the drive to constantly evolve. For example, we recently opened a 10,000-sqm outdoor Xtreme outdoor park in Abuja. This is the first of its kind in the fitness space.</p><p><strong>What trends are you observing in the fitness space, and where do you envision the sector going?<br></strong>Fitness and spa services have consistently been on the rise, as people are becoming more health conscious. This is attested by the increase in the number of fitness centers and spas in recent years. From our experience, regardless of shocks in the economy, more people visit the gym to de-stress and work out to relieve the stress of the daily incessant pressures. We expect the fitness industry to continue to grow to accommodate the demand for world-class standard fitness centers. We also expect to see new trends, such as more outdoor gyms and sport centers that were previously neglected, creating opportunities for the average individual to maintain a healthy lifestyle. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is it important to build a relationship between the government and indigenous communities?<br></strong>The role of INPI is important to this country and the world because we have 68 native communities located throughout the national territory that represent the roots of the country and have great cultural and ethical richness. There are 68 indigenous languages spoken in our country, not to mention all the linguistic variations. The territories where they live have been protected by the communities, including the varieties within them. The main ecological reserves of the country are within indigenous territories such as the Lacandona jungle, which is populated by the indigenous communities of Chiapas. There is a great natural richness in these communities. Paradoxically, studies carried out by government agencies demonstrate that the poorest among them, however, are also indigenous.</p><p><strong>Which strategies are you pursuing to change this?<br></strong>That is an important question. Why are communities with such culture and natural richness, traditional knowledge, and history marginalized? This is due to a lack of employment opportunities, and health and education. They are also forced to migrate, a phenomenon that has grown exponentially in the last few years. They migrate to the cities and to agricultural crops in the north in Sinaloa, Sonora, Baja California, and especially the US. There are a few answers, but one that we have had trouble understanding is why our communities have been excluded in the decision-making processes. The government decides which programs, projects, and resources are given to the communities and regions, and often they are not included or consulted before these are executed. As a result, despite certain actions and resources, the poverty and conditions of the communities have not improved. That is why this government has decided to view indigenous communities as active subjects rather than objects of public policy. This new institute is the instrument of the government to cater to their needs. The communities are capable of making decisions and deciding which projects they want to implement, rather than the government forcing projects upon them.</p><p><strong>What kind of priorities or projects have arisen from these consultations with the communities?<br></strong>There have been multiple initiatives. We were with the president talking to the Yaqui tribe, which raised three issues: the sovereignty of their territory, since their water supply is being used by agricultural companies; in the city of Hermosillo, they have to drink contaminated water; and an integral development plan according to their capabilities. As a result, the institute is working on a justice plan for the Yaqui people. Every government institution needs to put their resources, human, financial, and technical, to the service of this plan. We will have regional development plans for the 68 indigenous communities, but also for the Afromexican community in Oaxaca and Guerrero. Our main premise is that any development or welfare initiative is decided by the communities.</p><p><strong>Considering this new strategy, how do you plan to create synergy between the communities and the private sector?<br></strong>By law, we need to consult communities before we do any project. We did it for the strategic plan of the president for the development plan of the Istmo de Tehuantepec. We have done seven consultations directed at the indigenous communities in the territory, both in Oaxaca and Veracruz. Nowadays we are consulting about the Tren Maya in Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatán, and Quintana Roo. We do this process because we are convinced that any development plans have to consider the local and regional contexts and help them actively participate in planning and implementation. And it also comes down to the equitable distribution of benefits, since it is not fair that we continue with this colonial logic of destroying nature and keeping communities poor and marginalized. If there is an investment project by the government or a private entity, the voice of the local communities must be heard, and there should also be an equitable distribution of benefits. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How big of a role does Mexico play within the firm's international business strategy?<br></strong>The largest market by far for most businesses catered to by the firm is the US, which will not change, although Mexico plays a highly strategic role. First, Mexico is a great trade partner of the US, its largest investor. Mexico comprehensively serves many of the firm's key clients. We certainly do not cover all areas, but on the commercial side, we cover employment, transactional and environmental, and IP litigation. We do not engage in criminal law, or specific law practices, where we work with other highly specialized firms. Mexico plays a crucial role, accounting for large transactions in Latin America. We are able to team up with US attorneys or colleagues in Colombia for such transactions across Latin America, cost-effectively. And with many being Spanish speakers, we enjoy a major advantage over US attorneys.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about your largest projects in Mexico?<br></strong>In 2019, we closed a unique and groundbreaking project locally, as Telefónica inked a crucial agreement with AT&amp;T to share infrastructure on which to provide mobile telecom services. It will make both companies much more efficient and able to compete with dominant player America Movil. This maximizes efficiencies and savings in the payment of spectrum, and both companies can take advantage of new technologies including the approaching 5G era. I expect end-users to benefit from this. Certainly, Telefónica and AT&amp;T will benefit from this, as well as the general market. It is a significant agreement. Meanwhile, we also represent Fibra Uno, and many investments were made in the real state sector. I would also mention the sale of the Pizza Hut franchise in Mexico by Premium Brands and the re-structuring of the entire franchise network. Premium Brands operates across Latin America, owning Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises. This restructuring will separate the brands and franchising to address different markets, and was an interesting transaction from many perspectives. We have been working on some of those transactions, and it has been a particularly challenging year of restructuring for many companies.</p><p><strong>It sounds like you cover a wide variety of sectors, from fast food to real estate and telecoms. Is telecoms and ICT the firm's biggest segment in Mexico?</strong><br>The industrial and telecoms sectors were the most active in 2019. We had an active energy sector two or three years ago, but many national energy projects have been halted. We were particularly active in nonrenewable energy. Eolic projects were not active in 2019.</p><p><strong>As a law firm, what strategies are you planning to use to further strengthen your presence in Mexico?<br></strong>I would highlight being price competitive, which is challenging in this market. Second, we have been keen to retain and attract talent, which has widely been a challenge. A mentor of mine said “never let a good crisis go to waste," and indeed, there are always good opportunities. We have to remain up to date with change and close to the administration as we pursue fresh opportunities.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>Our goal is to continue providing excellent service to our clients, and when I say “clients," I mean my internal clients that are those of the firm in the US, and our external clients, clients that we have brought into the firm. We aim to have the same volume of work to keep the firm busy and competitive. I expect this to be a more challenging year than 2019. I do not think there is a clear definition at least for the long term in many sectors where we are active, which will impact investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In what way will the COVID-19 pandemic impact FDI in Mexico?<br></strong>I am not an economist, but I am an optimist, and in the end this situation should be a boost for Mexico. That said, we cannot ignore that many businesses will close down, and there will be a great deal of unemployment. Manufacturing is now open, and the financial sector is still working. It is, therefore, only a gear change—we have gone from fifth gear down to first. Some things will probably change in the post-COVID-19 world, though the crisis will not bring the economy to a permanent halt. Mexico saw its first COVID-19 case some three months after Italy and Spain. Fortunately, some say, the government here was quick to declare a full emergency. In this sense, Mexico might have an advantage. As other countries lift their work, consumption, and social interaction restrictions, there will be a rush of economic activity, investment, and spending. That will happen in other countries one or two months before it happens in Mexico, and when the restrictions are lifted, Mexico should thus receive the benefits of the opening abroad. It is not easy to predict the future, but difficult times bring out the best in of humanity, and we will prevail.</p><p><strong>What industries does Uhthoff, Gómez Vega &amp; Uhthoff serve the most?<br></strong>As IP is the core of Uhthoff, Gómez Vega &amp; Uhthoff practice, we have clients from the tech, pharma, leisure, and financial sectors, among others. Not much has changed for Uhthoff, Gómez Vega &amp; Uhthoff with the new administration. For example, our clients in the oil sector will continue to need our assistance to protect their IP in Mexico even if their oil exploration projects in the Gulf of Mexico are cancelled. The same goes for pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, I do not see many changes in the needs of our clients in the telecommunication sector. The government wants to introduce some new regulations, but none of them affect the investment on protection of their IP rights in Mexico. Before the pandemic, the tourism sector was doing well, and many investments were planned in that area. That sector is on hold now, and all the plans are being delayed. For example, the construction of new resorts is on hold. Investors are just delaying decisions while they see how long this crisis will last.</p><p><strong>What are some of the biggest changes to Mexico's legal framework over the last year or so?<br></strong>There have been some changes, but the problem has been the executive actions taken by the president. These have created discomfort, uncertainty, informality, and a lack of legal clarity for businesses and investors. Some of the changes are good, but we will have to wait and see their full effect. The current government has also made some amendments to reforms enacted by former president Enrique Peña Nieto that were originally well received in the international arena. There have been many changes, and this has led to uncertainty. For example, the government cancelled a multibillion-dollar airport project because of corruption, but cancelling it will cost more. The solution was not to cancel the project but to penalize those responsible for corruption.</p><p><strong>What are your expansion plans and priorities for the next three to five years?<br></strong>Uhthoff, Gómez Vega &amp; Uhthoff has started an ambitious project to expand our entertainment law practice. Due to the lockdown, all the streaming companies are making large sums of money. That money will be invested in current—although as of today halted—and new content projects. That is a business opportunity that we are looking into. This is not a new field for us, but we are strengthening our practice in this area by incorporating new, specialized attorneys.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What motivated you to establish V5 Consultores?<br></strong><span></span>V5 Consultores is not just a law firm, but a firm of attorneys, accountants, and chemical engineers that provide legal and business advice to clients including governments. As a multidisciplinary group, we try to identify our clients' problems and look for the optimal solution. We currently have two offices in Mexico City, and we cover areas such as tax consultancy and litigation, foreign trade, customs and regulatory, corporative, contracts, litigation (civil and mercantile), administrative law, criminal law, real estate, compliance, industrial property, health regulatory, and immigration law. We have a small representative office in Miami that acts as a bridge for our clients in the US, Europe, and Latin America interested in doing business in Mexico. At V5 Consultores, we cover many areas, being highly specialized in integrally advising and representing businesses.</p><p><strong>What are some of the biggest challenges companies are facing?<br></strong>People in Mexico are tired of corruption, insecurity, and the lack of opportunities, which is why the majority voted for Andrés Manuel López Obrador. The president is introducing policies to solve these social matters. The increase in minimum wage is a welcome step, but the bigger problem is unemployment and lack of business activity continue. There are also external factors that continue to damage the economy such as a worldwide recession. Mexico needs to instill confidence in investors in order to boost FDI inflows. Moreover, Mexico needs to improve its credit ratings. For us, there are several openings on the horizon because of new laws and legislation. For example, the government has introduced new deductions and taxes for the digital economy. Tax advisors and taxpayers are required to declare all the tax opinions that generate benefit for taxpayers, including deductions, exemptions, and deferrals. Similarly, there are other opportunities to be found in our business line, such as outsourcing regulation and cannabis regulation.</p><p><strong>What other areas are you looking to expand into?<br></strong>Cannabis regulation is one area that we certainly are looking to exploit. Cannabis regulation includes certain administrative and customs laws, and our health regulatory area is doing work on that. Work in such field should definitively increase when the regulations are approved by congress. We look forward to litigation work too, which might be expected to pick up in a low economy as consequence of breach of contracts. We also plan to increase our advisory to our clients in their business relations with the government, including obtaining for them authorizations, and licenses and participating in tenders and bid invitations.</p><p><strong>What is your recommendation for a company looking to enter the Mexican market?<br></strong>Our recommendation is to seek timely expert advice to avoid costly mistakes. Obstacles can be presented such as Mexican bureaucracy, differences in idiosyncrasies, and an evolving law regime. For example, the current government is introducing new regulatory measures regarding our FTA with the US and Canada and a capital gains tax regime to stop companies from transferring gains to jurisdictions with friendlier tax regimes. Thus, when giving advice, V5 Consultores first looks at a company's business line and terms of operation and from there provides a strategy that complies with Mexico's laws and is business efficient.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>We are looking at opening an office in Mérida because it is a growing economy with important domestic and foreign investments, and we have increasing business there. Moreover, the government is planning to invest in the region, and competent advice will be needed. 2020 will be good for us, but we need to be careful with our costs and expenditures as result of the deacceleration of the economy. At present, there is a great deal of work on the tax side, and this trend will continue throughout the year. The trade sector also presents many opportunities for us. 60% of our clients is Mexican and 40% is foreign, mainly from the US, Canada, and Spain. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is the SME segment in Mexico an important business opportunity for investment?<br></strong>SMEs represent 98% of the market and translate into 53% of the national GDP and 70% of employment in the country. Most established traditional finance institutions and banks do not easily lend to SMEs or do so at rates that hinder the potential of the business. Access to capital is the most important catalyst to scale an already working and profitable business, and that is where we come in. Many SMEs need access to investment alongside money management support and other assistance in establishing and monitoring back office activities. CAPEM means Capital Empresarial, as we see ourselves as businesspeople helping businesspeople upgrade their old- school approach to business practices or complementing profitable businesses with high revenues that just lack the administrative platforms needed to take a business to the next level. Our credit options range from MXN1-100 million. We consistently attend events and meetings of SMEs and start-up trends to recognize and approach the main and upcoming players looking to diversify our participation and portfolio to better manage our risk and learn more from different industries.</p><p><strong>What methods do you use to raise capital for your portfolio?<br></strong>We started and remain mostly funded by our own founding investment capital. Still, as this is a debt fund, our core operations are to invest in the capital market dealing with debt bonds and managing a healthy debt portfolio of short-term and long-term maturity bonds and sharing the risk within the pool of investors that buy our debt, which is the debt of the companies we invest in packaged in a financially healthy way. As we have grown, we have also gathered the interest of many investment groups overseas looking to enter into JVs in Latin America. Analyzing the maturity of our own business, we see JVs as the long-term strategy to sustainably accessing investment capital to expand our operations in Latin American and beyond. For the next decade, we want to establish ourselves in Latam and have already recognized important opportunities in Peru and Colombia that could launch us into the rest of the region.</p><p><strong>Can you share with us some of your success stories or pet projects?<br></strong>Among that large pool of SMEs, the majority of companies are those operating directly in B2C activities in a wide range of industries. However, there is a smaller, but still significant, group of SMEs that specifically work in micro-scale financing for other SMEs. Interests rates and capital caps are still restrictive as these companies themselves have a complicated access to funds for lending. Taking this into account, we have positioned ourselves as the second level financing for these set of companies that can, for example, turn a single MXN10-million loan into 1,000 micro loans to fund 1,000 projects or boost 1,000 companies' needs. Our most important projects are thus, the ability itself to anonymously support thousands of projects, start-ups and, at the end of the day, the entrepreneurial dreams of thousands of Mexicans.</p><p><strong>How do you expect COVID-19 to influence the sector and the economy in general?<br></strong>Most companies, specifically SMEs, are facing or will face make-or-break situations depending exclusively on how they handle the crisis. We have created a program called Smart Money that looks to actively work to create best practices and improve continuously their businesses. Regarding COVID-19, with some companies we have started stress tests on their cash flow to prepare companies for situation like these in which an external event might shorten or complicate their financial stability. Most companies were, unsurprisingly, ill-prepared for such events and ran on a particularly short financial leash. Many management lessons will come out of this crisis, and people will be more responsible in their business-as-usual operations from now on. We are working closely with many companies on different terms forecasts and exploring different scenarios so that we can be as prepared as possible to the consequences of this crisis. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are some of the findings from Mexico Top Management Perspectives 2020?<br></strong>Our Top Management survey in 2020 captured a little over 1,000 responses; it was prepared up until December 2019 and thus does not cover the impact of COVID-19; however, we have conducted this survey 15 years in a row so we have a large amount of data and can draw conclusions around trends. One of the key aspects of the 2020 survey was that eight out of 10 decision makers who responded were looking at a single- and double-digit growth for their companies over the next three years, an opinion that is likely to change in light of recent months' events: oil price collapse, exchange rate volatility, and the COVID-19 economic impact. Undoubtedly, these executives recognize the great opportunity in the Mexican market for their companies to continue growing, although they also see challenges, some of which require government support including economic stability and a comprehensive action among all the different stakeholders. Mexico had been going through a change in the regime with a new federal administration. Its top concerns were maintaining macroeconomic stability, dealing with security, improving the rule of law and reducing corruption. There are still many structural issues that the Mexican business environment is keeping an eye on regarding the development of public policy and how the different stakeholders in the economy—not only the public but also the private sector—play a key role in addressing these concerns.</p><p><strong>What are the main concerns of the business community when it comes to the tax reform?<br></strong>Part of the Top Management survey showed that decision makers believe Mexico requires a comprehensive and extensive tax reform. On the one hand, there are not enough tax collections in comparison to the size of the economy, and we have the lowest tax collections within OECD countries. However, we also have to deregulate and promote flexibility to promote investment and more international trade, which is one of the most important areas for the Mexican economy. Our respondents want a relook of the full tax system, perhaps different areas of taxing the economy. One example would be indirect taxes, which in Mexico means the VAT from sales taxes. Sales taxes are normally imposed on the sale of services and products, and, therefore, it does not matter if one is registered with the tax authorities. This is considered an efficient way of tax collection and reducing the informality in the Mexican economy. That has been raised as a possible area of opportunity for Mexico.</p><p><strong>Which industries in Mexico will undergo the deepest transformation and in what way due to the COVID-19 pandemic?<br></strong>The way we approach business travel, international travel and meetings, and many other ways of working will be challenged and changed. For example, remote working and means of communications between different teams at different locations are now becoming a reality. There is a huge opportunity at this time for decision makers to look at this more as an opportunity rather than a threat and come out stronger in terms of their business models. This should be looked at as a learning phase for them to change and push change into their organizations. I am sure there will be extensive changes. We have been looking, for instance, at the changes in the Chinese market. We had a webcast with our CEO of KPMG in China, who was explaining how after two months of a lockdown in the cities of Wuhan and Beijing, companies are starting to partially resume operations. The new businesses that are resuming operations are starting to question the old traditional models with what they have seen in the last six to 10 weeks in a remote mode with different methods and tools.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What projects and initiatives are you prioritizing for the six-year period and why?<br></strong>It is necessary to start by mentioning the major pillars of the Fourth Transformation, led by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. On repeated occasions, the president has expressed that the poor should come first for the good of Mexico. There is another equally important project, necessary to achieve the objectives of the first one: the fight against corruption. Today, the social programs of the government of President López Obrador are guaranteed to continue because they have the resources that the country previously lost due to corrupt practices, which are no longer permitted. The pension for the elderly, the support for children with disabilities, the provision of scholarships to students from poor families, and free care and medicine are possible. Regarding public works and infrastructure, the federal administration has, among other major strategic projects: the new Felipe Angeles airport, which replaces the defunct New Mexico International Airport project in Texcoco, cancelled due to its exorbitant costs; Tren Maya, which will energize the economy of southeast Mexico and generate 30,000 jobs in each of its seven stages; and the Dos Bocas refinery in Tabasco with a capacity of 340,000bpd, the first refinery built in the last 40 years. The objective behind the president's great projects and initiatives is to carry out the fourth transformation of Mexico to establish the foundations of a new era for the nation, in which a few will cease to profit from the wealth of all and a new horizon of hope and well-being will open up for Mexican families.</p><p><strong>What next steps must be taken to legalize the medical use of cannabis in the country?<br></strong>Cannabis regulation does not mean decriminalizing or legalizing, but rather reforming the use and consumption of drugs, since the current prohibitionist policy has increased violence in Mexico and criminalized a fraction of the population that consumes it. Once the draft bill on the regulation of cannabis was generally approved in the Senate of the Republic in early March 2020, a new phase of the debate opens in the Congress of the Union to agree on the precise next steps. In the regulation of marijuana, the biggest challenge is to balance the public health approach, with the interests derived from its commercialization. The growth in cannabis consumption forced us to explore a different approach, because the objective could no longer be to eradicate the use of a substance with such prevalence in society. The issue had to be approached from a public health perspective, establishing the right to self-determination and consumer welfare. With the regulation of cannabis, Mexico is advancing on its still-long road to the well-being and economic improvement of its people, factors that demand to be accompanied by health, security, and respect for human rights.</p><p><strong>Considering that the increase in insecurity in Mexico is one of the main concerns of the business community in the country, what strategies is the secretariat using to address security concerns?<br></strong>In the government's new structure, responsibility for public security is outside the Ministry of the Interior, a new agency that now focuses primarily on managing the country's domestic policy which is the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection, responsible for preventive federal police action. Security policy from the president is implemented transversally throughout every public institution; all members of the cabinet have interference in it, from the scope of competence of each head of secretariat. Within its sphere of action, the Ministry of the Interior contributes to social peace by establishing agreements with the various social, political and religious actors in Mexico, through dialogue, tolerance, plurality, and respect for human dignity. In addition, the Ministry of the Interior plays an important role in the harmony of Mexicans, as it is now also the secretariat for human rights. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are your main priorities as the president of Club de Industriales?<br></strong>Under my leadership, so far, we have been able to double our exquisite gallery of modern paintings. This is a unique club. Even though we are not a museum, we are famous for curating the best collection of modern Mexican art. Our gallery is famous among Mexican presidents and ministers. Notably, we have also had the opportunity to entertain kings and queens of the UK, Sweden, Norway, and Belgium, as well as several presidents of the US and almost all of the presidents of South American countries. We also host heads of banks and central banks. Our list of members contains all the big names from the oil, transportation, steel, and cement industries.</p><p><strong>What is your perception of the new president's vision for business in Mexico?<br></strong>As president of one of the most attractive and wealthy nations in Latin America and the world, Andrés Manuel López Obrador's challenge is to provide a better life for all 120 million Mexicans. His mission is to correct the mistakes of former presidents. His most important mission is to eliminate corruption and then fight poverty and generate jobs. The majority of businesspeople agree with the president's objectives; however, we do not necessarily agree with the way he is doing it and think he is making mistakes. He does not accept any contributions made by previous governments or members of the public or business world. We have built a great nation, and we must continue to fight and incorporate models of governance.</p><p><strong>How do you mitigate the risks of the new administration while continuing to undertake new projects?<br></strong>None of the major companies have left Mexico, which is a positive sign. They are all here and waiting to grow. We are the ones that are building industries and working to offer more and better paid jobs. We have brought in new technology and are the ones who maintain the relationships between Mexico and countries around the world. We will continue to work hard and advance our economy and society. Mexico has 11,000km of coastlines, which means the country will always be an attractive place for investors. The country also has significant potential to develop solar and geothermal energy. For example, we export geothermal energy to the US.</p><p><strong>How has financial inclusion advanced in Mexico?<br></strong>I was the first person to introduce a credit card in Mexico through the BankAmericard Credit Card, followed by Visa. Bank of America decided to launch its card in Mexico after I went to San Francisco and convinced my executives to offer it in Mexico under specific conditions. My suggestion was to introduce USD credit cards with a maximum limit of USD100,000 to the most important executives and business leaders in Mexico. Back then, we were the number-one bank in Mexico—we even financed Pemex. To date, Bank of America is one of the largest foreign banks in Mexico.</p><p><strong>What will digital banking bring to the sector?<br></strong>According to my understanding, the president recently approved a plan to use technology and innovation to offer banking services to people living in remote areas. These include agricultural and indigenous communities. I am not directly involved, but I am pushing for this technology to be enabled. It is one of the largest areas of opportunities.</p><p><strong>What is your message for potential investors?<br></strong>Mexico is making great efforts to improve the overall living standards. At present, the main challenge is to improve the economic conditions of around 40 million people living in southern Mexico and enable their participation in the economy. Education and innovation are two tools the government can use to its advantage to bridge the gap between different regions of Mexico. The end goal is to develop remote regions to the point where they can better participate in the export market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pandemic impacted your operations in Panama, and what impact have you seen regarding energy demand?</h4><p>It has had a deep impact. We have in place many contingency measures implemented to protect employees and customers. All our office employees are working remotely, and we have enforced  several policies to ensure social distancing and the health of our personnel. At the same time, we are also taking care of the business end. In this respect, cashflow management has been essential for us and we are working with clients and suppliers who can help us to maintain healthy finances. Finally, we have maintained our social initiatives. We have made donations to express our solidarity with society. We are proud that we have participated in providing the energy consumption of a Hotel facility used as hospital to treat patients affected by the pandemic. Additionally, alongside with other companies of Grupo Argos, our corporate group, we reached an agreement with the Ministry of Health, to provide oxygen treatments for COVID-19 positive patients in their homes as a mean to reduce pressure on hospital infrastructures by lowering the percentage of patients who require hospitalization. We made an initial donation of USD100,000 to this program intended to serve approximately 100,000 people in conjunction with the health administration in the area of Juan Diaz in the province of Panama. Another pillar for the company is to maintain a healthy business for our shareholders. The business is seeing lower revenue; however, we are seeking to make it profitable even during these difficult times. We are also taking care of our stakeholders. On the demand side, we have seen a decrease, particularly in the hospitality and tourism sectors, where some companies have had to halt operations almost entirely. Still, we have maintained many of our operations because we have some stable customers. Nevertheless, overall demand has fallen by about 20% from pre-COVID-19 levels.</p><h4>What emerging trends do you expect to persist beyond COVID-19?</h4><p>We do not expect any long-term structural changes to demand after the pandemic is over, with the demand growth rate returning to normal levels after a year and half or two years. Offices and real state could be affected, however. Remote working is going to increase and that could impact our commercial clients. Consumption in the suburbs might increase, while it could decrease in the city center because workers are not going to their offices, but the overall level will  normal. In the long run, the fundamentals are strong and industries and commerce will recover.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your partnership with Innowatts and the potential that these solutions have for your clients?</h4><p>This partnership was developed through a capital venture. We are reviewing many start-ups to analyze which of them could have potential for our business. That was done in 2018, and we are in the process of an operative integration with Innowatts. We have high expectations that this start-up will grow.  We have an innovation division that is seeking to bring that company into a local development. We are seeking to implement these services to different clients, but first for Colombia, which is where our innovation division is located. We would then bring it to other markets such as Panama.</p><h4>What's the current status of your ongoing projects in Central America?</h4><p>We are developing a 10MW solar farm in Chiriquí­. The implementation process of that farm was halted due to the pandemic. Our goal is to have this 10MW operational by 2021. We have another 10 MW solar farm in Honduras for Argos, a company in our group. We also have a 4MW farm in Honduras. We should have at least 40MW generation capacity in solar energy by the end of 2021. As for wind power, we do not expect to open new plants and will continue with our existing plant in Costa Rica. We are waiting to see prices changes  in the battery and storage market to address these technologies in Central America which would be a significant step forward. As for solar, we want to add 30MW of capacity in the next two years for our B2B segment. This B2B segment is our main goal in Central America. We do not have a distribution business in Central America; however, we are constantly looking for opportunities in areas in which we already have experience in Colombia. We also want to implement the storage capacity associated with our B2B clients.</p><h4>What's your outlook for 2020 in Panama and its energy sector?</h4><p>We expect Panama to continue gradually lifting quarantine measures and reopening the economy. We expect that some sectors will be open again within the next few months. By our forecast, we think that the negative outlook could be worse than what the rating agencies believe. In general terms, the quicker the economy reopens, the faster the recovery. We think that the economy is poised to shrink by 5% this year.</p><h4>What would your message be to the international community on Panama's capacity to recover economically from the pandemic?</h4><p>Panama is a hub in the region and the global importance of the canal is clear. And that will continue to be the case in the future. Panama has a strong banking industry and a lot of well-educated individuals. In my view, Panama has a good chance of recovering quickly. Besides, the Tocumen airport is important and a hub in the Americas. In a nutshell, I send a positive message because Panama is a strong country. Investors will continue investing here in the long term. Do not forget that this is a dollarized economy, which is another important factor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What opportunities did you identify to create a fintech company in 2018?<br></strong>In 2001, I founded a company with my brothers in the call center sector selling credit cards. We experienced sustainable growth until 2008, when the financial pandemic hit. The US economy halted, and we reinvented ourselves to become an issuer of payment methods. At that time in Mexico, there was an oligopoly of French companies providing that service, but there was room in the market to enter. We were able to disrupt the market by reducing prices and offering better post-sale service. Since then, we have experienced rapid growth. We started moving USD10 million; today, we move USD1 billion because we saw an opportunity for Mexican companies to start using this prepaid system. Originally, it was a product mostly for companies. However, now we are focusing on people. We did not know that there would be the 2018 Fintech Law, which has created a broader scenario than what we wanted.</p><p><strong>Why did Toka decide to establish an assertive investment decision during the COVID-19 pandemic?<br></strong>We did not choose the crisis, but the crisis chose us. Businesspeople have to adapt to changing scenarios. The product changes, but evolution is necessary. When you launch a company, you do not know in which direction it will head, but it is important to move forward and seek opportunities. In 2008, our business experienced an economic blow, but we reinvented and diversified ourselves. We have performed excellently: we have a great product and a great payment method company, and we do not have the costs of a French corporation. Today, the challenge is different, and Toka has made huge changes to continue supporting its clients. With our investment in Toka Fintech and Accendo Bank, we have a different financial expectation for the unbanked, and we are convinced we will change the way of doing business in Mexico.</p><p><strong>Why did Toka decide to invest in Accendo Bank?<br></strong>Toka has its plans and it needed strength. We have joined forces with a bank, as we saw the business potential in that fintech bank. This particular financial institution seeks to be the largest fintech bank in Mexico. As we are an issuer of cards, joining forces with a bank is a great opportunity to cater into the unbanked. Some 13% of financial transactions in Mexico are though payment methods, while 87% are through cash. With this investment, we want to serve the unbanked and help the informal sector. We want to serve the markets and the local markets. Through this merger, we will offer the population the possibility of banking themselves in five minutes. Through our new, easy-to-use app, people can not only sign up for bank accounts easily, but it will facilitate transfers and better support clients. This bank account offers access to a world that people did not have access to before. Mexico is a country growing in terms of smartphones. We also have an innovative and technology concept to be launched in 4Q2020. We expect to increase Mexico's banked population. We have merged our company with the bank to offer a real and regulated project. In addition, the bank will change its name to Toka Banco. However, there are some strict regulations that we need to follow to do so.</p><p><strong>What opportunities are there for Mexico in the global restructuring of the financial market?<br></strong>There are applications in developing countries that have rapidly grown and expanded. There are many technologies for early adoption. Today, the pandemic has shown how the future has changed. People have learned to hold video conferences; it is obvious we need tools that can make lives easier. I expect to see deeper digital transformations, and those banks that do not take part in these changes will struggle. But this is a process of the patient. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has your professional experience prepared you for your role as CEO of BIVA?<br></strong>My professional experience has always been connected to private equity, and I have worked for many years at private equity funds, including my role as director of the guild for five years. This experience has led me to understand further the conflicts companies have when they need access to those resources required to continue growing; a company starts with investments from a private party and aspires to some investment from the public sector. My background pushed me to get involved with the stock exchange, specifically with BIVA's proposal. I am committed to what we do and what an amazing opportunity this stock exchange represents. We see many opportunities in the market, particularly in private capital funds and Mexican companies that are in the process of becoming institutionalized. We also believe that there are many opportunities to increase the number of individual investors in Mexico and increase the participation of institutional investors in equity markets and corporate debt.</p><p><strong>BIVA has faced challenges throughout its history. How have you adapted to these challenging scenarios?<br></strong>BIVA was bound to face challenges; the idea of having a second stock market was controversial for some. We had to research why, in a country like Mexico, the stock market was not taking off as it should and how a second option could be the solution. Perhaps one of the most important challenges was convincing the stock exchange guild to invest in a new infrastructure, one that was necessary to become the new stock exchange in Mexico. All of this happened under a government that was about to leave office. When the new government took office, it came with a different vision of markets, trade, and economic policy. We had to recreate our work plan and adjust it to the new administration; it was quite challenging. Additionally, we were competing against the BMV, which had over 100 years of activity. We began working in the midst of all this, but we stayed true to our convictions and had faith in our business model. We want to guarantee access to efficient financing for upcoming and growing companies, not just to those companies that are already well-established and sophisticated. In the last two years, we have been under a cloud of political uncertainty that drives away long-term investments and are now facing a global pandemic that is shaking markets to their core. It has been a challenging but incredible experience. We are proud to be part of a major change in the Mexican economy through its stock market infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Taking into account the cloud of uncertainty in markets due to the pandemic, what strategies will you employ to continue to attract investors?</strong><br>We have developed a scheme to attract more participants, in terms of both supply and demand. Our intention, as a stock exchange, is to offer an authentic opportunity for growth in Mexico, available to companies and investors. We want to accompany the investor right from the start; one of our missions is for Mexicans to get acquainted with the stock exchange, in terms of its role, goals, products, and advantages. There are many myths around the stock exchange. We want Mexican businesspeople to participate as investors in the stock exchange, along with Mexican companies, of course. We are convinced that regular people should invest in the stock exchange. Even in a crisis, the stock market will eventually result in profit, so it is a way for citizens to save efficiently. It is about smart and efficient investments. This is the way for Mexican companies to grow and a way to distribute wealth in our society. As companies generate wealth, investing is a way for everyone to get involved and progress.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong><em></em>In what way has the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way Banco Azteca makes decisions?<br></strong>This pandemic has changed the horizon of decision making within companies. Digitalization is imperative, namely bringing clients through different channels, ensuring there is no friction, staying open 24/7, and having the capacity to deal with cyberattacks. Banco Azteca has more than 15 million clients, almost 2,000 branches, and operates in the physical world every single day of the year. Our priorities have changed. The first thing we made sure of since we are an essential industry is that we had to operate in the safest way possible, and that took us by surprise because no one was ready for this. Unfortunately, we were behind the curve with this pandemic. We had to increasingly make sure employees and customers felt as comfortable as possible during this pandemic. Running the show today is important for us because we provide credit for the popular Mexican sector. We are present in Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, and Peru, and our model requires people to work closely with our clients.</p><p><strong>What main trends have you seen in this sector, and what do you foresee for the rest of the year?<br></strong>There is naturally an increase in demand for credit because other banks have closed or reduced the amount of credit they are allocating. People tend to use us as a lender of last resort or last opportunity in the formal sector, and that frequently happens during crises or downturns. The kind of credit we can provide is either personal or consumer credit. Today, we have been concentrating heavily on providing relief and support to those who need it the most.</p><p><strong>What investments did Banco Azteca make in terms of its digital transformation and services prior to the pandemic?<br></strong>Over the past three years, we have spent close to USD1 billion in the digital world. Today, we have over 9 million clients who use our app on a daily basis. Our app is extremely user friendly and easy to work with, and we have seen the number of transactions increasing. This platform was started four years ago, and today we are competing with Bancomer as the most widely used app in the financial sector. In 2020, we will definitely reach 10.5-11 million clients, and we are seeing an acceleration of the trend because of the pandemic. People are using digital apps more than ever, so I am glad we are ready for this one.</p><p><strong>What can be done to encourage more collaboration between the private and public sectors and ensure the Mexican economy continues to move ahead?</strong><br>I see the three Cs as being important; the first is good and open communication to make sure people understand what is going on. You also need to make sure there is solid coordination, which means different entities need to do what each one is supposed to in order to help address the issues. The last is cooperation, because if people are willing to work on the same wavelength, then initiatives between the public and private sectors will not be handicapped. We need to focus on communication, cooperation, and coordination to make sure that we are doing our best to address what is ahead of us. At this time, it is an enormous challenge that requires the best from us all.</p><p><strong>What are your next priorities regarding projects that Banco Azteca will be investing in over the coming years?<br></strong>At present, we are putting a great deal of attention into cybersecurity, a major issue for any institution operating in the digital world. If you cannot make your operations safe, your clients feel safe, and the system as bullet-proof as possible, you are likely handicapping yourself. Companies need to use all the data available through the digital world by utilizing AI to make better decisions and better understand clients to determine their needs and consumption patterns.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is driving the dynamism of the retail fuel market in Mexico?<br></strong>The opening of the energy market makes business radically different than before. There is continuous infrastructure development in terms of supply, product, storage capabilities, and product availability in locations where there was none before. These changes are positive, because diversifying brands and value offers is something that benefits the consumer. Initially, we saw the largest global brands entering the Mexican market, because Mexico is the sixth country in gasoline consumption and growing. There many opportunities for fuel growth in retail, which is estimated to be 2.1% annually for the next 20 years versus the reduction in global demand for fuel. Mexico is, therefore, attractive, and as a national company, we must be prepared to compete with large players entering the market.</p><p><strong>What is the added value you provide for consumers?<br></strong>Some companies are investing in training or logistics, while others are investing in brand awareness. We focus 100% on the final consumer with 257 locations operated by over 3,100 employees. We also have full control over the quality of the products, with our own brands for lubricants, additives and coolants. With our traditional convenience store, we are a one-stop destination for our clients.</p><p><strong>Your strategy is to open 500 new service stations by 2023. How are you advancing toward this goal?<br></strong>We plan to invest over USD300 million until 2023 and to reach over 500 service stations in direct operation. Real estate is important because, rather than being the biggest company, we want to be the best company for service stations in Mexico. We currently are the first in service, number, and quality. To make our growth organized, we have a specialized team deciding on strategic locations for growth. We may take over the operation of some existing locations previously managed by other brands.</p><p><strong>What has been the market reaction to your app launched in 4Q2019?<br></strong>Technology is fundamental to compete. We have invested around USD14 million in the last three years to update our network, which allows clients to have the same experience, whether they use our services in Nuevo León, Baja California, or Chihuahua. Clients can request invoices through our app, and soon they will be able to pay through it too. We consider the multichannel offer critical, giving the client what they want, when they want it, and how they want it through delivery. The app was launched only in Mexico, but the global brand is planning to integrate it. Mexico is wonderful because the percentage of young people is growing, which forces us to develop in line with their needs. We even have the license for Pokémon Go, making all our 7-Eleven stores in Mexico official Pokémon Go stops.</p><p><strong>What are your goals and objectives for the rest of 2020?<br></strong>Our target is to close 2020 with a network of around 300 service stations in direct operation; we are currently at 257. We will enter the B2B segment as a wholesaler, because it is a market we want to cater to. To make consumers' lives even easier, we are launching a training focused on technology and customers for our sales team to enrich clients' experience. We also want to strengthen our app operation. In the B2B segment, the industry is asking for quality service. We want to provide logistics solutions, and we are increasing our fleet accordingly. We want to provide quality logistics, lower costs for clients, and provide added value in terms of quality and service. Technology will play a key role in achieving this. Petro-7 is a company undergoing a transformation to an integral company, and we need to be reliable in terms of stocking. We want to strengthen the brand by entering the wholesaler market, increasing the capacity of our fleet, and creating loyalty among our clients. We need to work hand in hand with the 7-Eleven brand, investing in innovation and technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What inspired you to create NRGI Broker?<br></strong><span></span>NRGI is a specialized insurance broker in the energy sector, and we are active in managing risks. I have 30 years of experience in the sector. We started working in Ciudad del Carmen, because 70% of Pemex's budget was spent there. We have worked during five six-year administrations with Pemex, and I have been navigating risks with them for 30 years. We participated in the energy reform by the invitation of the then-Secretary of Energy, because the administration needed to understand the risks involved in oil and which guarantees they were going to add to the contracts signed in the transition toward a more open oil market, which currently has over 130 contracts. That is when I built a relationship with the federal government. We worked on the insurance regulation currently managed by the Agency for Safety, Energy, and the Environment (ASEA) and created during the energy reform to provide guarantees and manage risks ranging from deep water exploration to local gas stations.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges your clients face in terms of risk management?<br></strong>Nowadays, we have two types of clients: clients who come from abroad and huge corporations that have already developed risk management plans; however, where it gets interesting is local contractors. Pemex has the third-largest insurance policy in the world because it covered the activities of its contractors as well. Mexico has little historical past concerning risk management, because companies are not used to having insurance for their activities. With this new government administration, the current insurance only covers Pemex's direct activities; any third party has to be responsible for its own operations. Hence, companies are obliged to know why it is necessary to have insurance, as they are required to. Any mistake could cost the owners their company.</p><p><strong>What does Mexico need to increase oil production?<br></strong>It needs to pay its suppliers. If President Andrés Manuel López Obrador manages to stabilize this situation, things can improve. Shallow waters have always been a specialty of Pemex, so what they are doing now is making contracts to drill. This way, you give work to Mexican companies in an already-matured industry. Not only is it a great opportunity, but it is also a way to make companies more efficient, because you only get paid if you actually produce oil. There are many opportunities to grow our oil fields by techniques such as fracking, which is a forbidden topic right now, but there is quite a bit of evidence that shows fracking is not detrimental. In general, there are more things to explore and drill.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the technology being used to make the industry more efficient?<br></strong>It is not discussed publicly, on account of smaller operators competing with Pemex using technology for their operations. Actually, there is not a lot of competition in the industry; it is more “complementary" work, because it is a small sector in which everybody knows each other.</p><p><strong>What are your growth plans both nationally and internationally?<br></strong>I have a license to operate in Mexico, and there is much to do locally. Internationally, what we do is work with foreign companies to make their lives easier. We are not only good at what we do, but we also understand regulations, barriers, and opportunities. As a result, we can be their facilitators in the country. We help our clients understand the regulations in the country, and we also match their business with objectives within the industry. We started an initiative called Voices of Energy, which was inspired by our work done to clarify the confusion around the new energy reform. Voices of Energy is a communication space where I invite officials, private companies, and legislators to meet and present a topic. This initiative is a side project, but it gives us many benefits. Through it, we can understand different perspectives on the issues the industry faces. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been your biggest achievements so far in Mexico?<br></strong>The biggest achievement has been our ability to adapt. I have been in Mexico through five changes of government over the past 30 years. For companies operating in the private sector, it is important to listen to policies and adapt to the directives and strategies of each government. We have been able to do that with the current government of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador. We look at clear objectives, such as where the money is going to be spent. We are in many different businesses in Mexico, with much of our activity focused in the upstream. The government has articulated that it wants to strengthen Pemex. It wants to provide more funding to directly and indirectly increase exploration production activities. As a result, we have tried to be dialed into its strategy. We want to compete and win their business. We are active in the deep-water, shallow-water, and onshore segments in different facets of our business. We have around 1,600 people in Mexico based at 11 different sites within Mexico. Many work to directly support the upstream business. We are also competing for the business of private producers that won concessions from prior governments. These companies are now progressing from planning stages to their development and production programs.</p><p><strong>What were the main objectives for the recent rebranding of Baker Hughes?<br></strong>Looking at recent history of both General Electric (GE), specifically its oil and gas division, and Baker Hughes, these entities merged July 2017 to create what is now Baker Hughes. That was step one of the rebranding. At the time, GE had a majority share of the new company, but it has since elected to reduce that to below 50%. Hence, it has been a good time to further establish the brand of Baker Hughes. The logo has changed, although the name has not due to its strong recognition in the industry. Baker Hughes is recognized as the only full-stream company in our sector, participating in up-, mid-, and downstream.  No one else has combined all these skills to support the entire industry, and we go beyond to provide integrated services. In addition to the upstream oil field services, we are in the business of liquefied natural gas, compression, power generation, gas processing, and equipment modernization.</p><p><strong>How has the Mexican market responded to your offering?<br></strong>It is a work in progress. Many companies are looking for creating efficiencies. They want to produce more with less. And it is about adapting to buying things in a different way, with different performance parameters, and evaluating the entire operation, including both CAPEX and OPEX. Companies are used to dealing with specialized suppliers. One of the elements we want to emphasize is to become energy partners with the sector. We want to support the whole sector to provide cleaner, safer, and more efficient energy to the world. We are involved in doing things more efficiently and with a smaller carbon footprint. There is, for example, integrity needed in pipelines, which is an area that can generate emissions in the form of methane gas. We supply valves, pipeline commissioning, and integrity services and compression equipment for this industry. Things can also be made more environmentally friendly. We are also big in the LNG space, which is a sector growing internationally as other more environmentally damaging fuels are being displaced. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your current perception of the Mexican energy sector?<br></strong>The market is expanding rapidly and presenting a lot of promising opportunities for us. We specialize in drilling and infrastructure, including pipelay and platform installation. We also perform hook ups and commissioning of all equipment needed to get the platform up and running. We use drilling fluids for towel termination in order to optimize production. We perform the drilling and aid Pemex on any reworking or maintenance required.</p><p><strong>How has the new package for marine infrastructure advanced?<br></strong>The package was supposed to be awarded in 2018, but it was delayed until February 2019. We won Package A and Package B as part of the consortium. We have already fulfilled our commitments by laying down all the pipelines for both contracts ahead of schedule. Our next task is installing the platforms as soon as we receive them from the fabrication yards. Once installed, we will do all the hook up and commissioning necessary to be fully operational. The project should be completed by March 2020.</p><p><strong>What are the key factors to guarantee success in winning these Pemex contracts?<br></strong>We have been working on various contracts for Pemex for the last 70 years. We have delivered our recent projects well in advance of the due date, thus allowing Pemex to use their facilities ahead of time, which translates to higher returns for Pemex. </p><p><strong>What are your main goals when it comes to your Latin American operations?<br></strong>Currently, we are only focusing on Mexico; we do not have any projects outside of Mexico. That being said, we do have plans to go back to Colombia. Protexa completed its first international pipeline in Colombia in 1966. We plan to reenter the Colombian market in a couple of years because we have our eyes on some interesting projects. The Colombian government is planning to invest USD8 billion in its oil and gas sector in two to three years, and we intend to bid for offshore drilling, pipelines, and platforms. Previously, we did a lot of onshore work in Colombia, laying more than 2,500km of pipeline. Overall, we have laid 4,800km of pipeline across South America.</p><p><strong>What strategies do you use to mitigate the risk of late payments from Pemex?<br></strong>The Mexican market is currently a little volatile, and Pemex is one of the biggest players in the market, which means there is always a risk of late payments. However, we have been managing this risk for years and are willing to continue doing so because this is part of the Mexican oil industry. One thing we are sure of is that Pemex will always be in business. Even if the price of oil declines, Pemex will have a major role to play because the cost of extracting oil in Mexico is lower than in other parts of the world. For example, the cost of extracting one barrel of oil in the North Sea can be three to four times more expensive than the Mexican average. Still, even in Mexico, the price of extracting one barrel of oil varies.</p><p><strong>What are some of the other projects that you are currently working on?<br></strong>Once we are done working on the new packages for marine infrastructure, we will concentrate on finding new projects. Another focus of ours will be increasing the production of light oil in Mexico, which is in line with Pemex's priorities. All our efforts are focused on ensuring Pemex is able to accomplish all its objectives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What is your overall perception of the health of the oil and gas industry considering we have an administration with a new vision for the sector?<br></strong>Diavaz has been in business for 46 years so we are used to seeing new administrations. In this case, we had energy reforms in 2013. But the current president of Mexico does not like these reforms because production has not peaked. Diavaz has four fields. Right now, we are producing around 20,000bpd. We are the second-largest producer of hydrocarbons in Mexico. In the US and Mexico, there are companies that have already started drilling offshore, which is exciting. We hope the president will realize we need new blocks to be built with the involvement of the private sector. We have told the president that, at the end of the six-year period of the current administration, the oil industry will produce about 280,000bpd minimum. I believe it will be slightly more, maybe 320,000-330,000bpd. As for our own production, we will produce between 50,000 and 60,000bpd, which is a tripling of our production.</p><p><strong>What have been the advancements in the four fields that Diavaz operates and how do you plan to expand your production in these fields?</strong><br>We have two small fields: the Barcodón block in Tamaulipas and the Catedral gas field in Chiapas. The positive thing about the Catedral field is that Chiapas needs the gas. We are drilling two wells at the Barcodón oil field. At Ebano oil field in the northwest, we hope to deliver around 15,000bpd. We got the approval in mid-2019. We will start drilling at Ebano in the last trimester of 2019, and I expect that program to carry on for two or three years.</p><p><strong>What does the country need to improve its gas infrastructure?</strong><br>One of the things we have to do is convince the government that gas is important; it industrializes the country. The most industrialized city in Mexico is Monterrey because it started producing natural gas in 1930. Another example is Guanajuato State, with places like León, which is one of the most industrialized regions in Mexico. It started producing gas 25 years ago. And that area has the petrochemicals industry. The president is trying to increase investment in the southeast in places such as Tabasco, Chiapas, and Oaxaca. Out of the 32 states we have in Mexico, 20 have natural gas. We need to have natural gas in all 32 states.</p><p><strong>Does Mexico need new refineries?<br></strong>One factor is that we must have a balance. There is no way a country can import 80% of its gas. Even if it is not a good business, or it is not as attractive as some other areas, we need some refineries. There are six right now. Pemex is trying to modernize its refineries to start producing more, and I hope it is successful. Overall, it will ultimately benefit the country. I was at Dos Bocas recently and there was a great deal of activity there. Building a new oil refinery will increase productivity and activity in Tabasco. It will be better for people in the area around Dos Bocas.</p><p><strong>Which of your projects is the highest priority for the company at the moment?<br></strong>The priority is to start increasing production in the four fields we have where we are producing oil and gas. However, we also have two fields, Cuervito and Fronterizo, where we only provide services. We signed a multiple services contract with Pemex for these two fields in 2001-2002. We are like an exploration and production company, but we get paid for the services we provide rather than for the increases in production or reserves. We hope that in a year or two we can talk to the president about pre- and post-energy reforms as a Mexican company that has two different ways of working—as a service contractor and as a producer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What vision do you want to convey as an appointed independent director of Pemex?<br></strong>I was appointed in September 2019. With the reforms to the Mexican oil law and as a result of the energy reform carried out by the previous government, Pemex evolved from being a parastatal company to a productive state enterprise. On the board of directors, the figure of independent directors was established. The board is made up of 10 positions, of which five members are part of the federal government. The independent directors exist to provide a diverse or non-biased vision from that of the government.</p><p><strong>What is needed to increase the production of Pemex?<br></strong>As a state-owned productive company, Pemex must increase its oil reserves and extractive activities. Mexico is rich in natural resources. In the last 18 years, there has been a persistent decline in production due to restrained investment for maintenance of the production infrastructure. In the previous six-year period, public policy followed by the Ministry of Energy was to promote explore and extractive activities within the private sector. This public policy has changed to one that will no longer be centered around privatization of the energy sector. Pemex is back to increasing its oil exploitation and refining activities This is not to say that the private sector could not get involved in these activities, but it would be mainly by partnering with Pemex in various forms of mutually beneficial associations. The current administration inherited Pemex in a critical financial situation. Debt and interest payments nearly tripled in the previous 12-year period, and on top of that, there are huge pension and labor liabilities. The current administration improved the balance sheet in the past year, mainly through capital contributions by the federal government. Recently, a very successful debt restructuring took place, and capital contributions from the federal government have improved the balance sheet. Another positive result from 2019 is that Pemex managed to stop the decline in oil production that had been present during the past 14 years. We closed 2019 with 1.58 million bpd. The goal is to reach 2.4 million bpd by 2024.</p><p><strong>Pemex is currently in a discussion with Talos about the Zama field. What have been the main advances, and in your opinion and what will be the result of these discussions?</strong><br>There are ongoing conversations with the company to agree as to who will carry out production activities, because due to geological formations in that field not previously known, the same reserves were assigned for exploitation in two separate areas to both Talos and Pemex by the National Hydrocarbons Commission. I am sure a joint production agreement will be reached to the mutual benefit of Pemex and Talos.</p><p><strong>What can be done to create more synergy between Pemex and other private-sector companies investing in the energy sector?</strong><br>The main goal is to increase production; Mexico is rich in fossil fuels, and it is important to implement a sustainable exploitation of natural resources. Companies grow with capital. Pemex is in a difficult financial situation, and the participation of private capital in exploration and exploitation is important in order to maintain and increase production. The challenge is to find the most appropriate legal instrument to attract private capital, generate certainty in the business environment, and ensure that the oil exploitation will reap benefits for the people of Mexico. That is why new association agreements are being explored and there are conversations with private international oil companies.</p><p><strong>How does Pemex plan to relieve its financial situation?<br></strong>Although the company was received by the new administration in a critical situation, it is moving forward. Clear rules are being generated, an environment of certainty is being created, and there is a new and healthy management of the company's finances; the debt has been restructured in favorable terms, and there has been a sound and solid response by the international financial markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your vision for CNH?<br></strong>The most important task for our administration will be the management of the fields granted in recent rounds and contribute to the national production of hydrocarbons. We have to be a facilitator and regulator at the same time. The market is excessively regulated, so we want to deregulate it to avoid complications for companies that want to meet the required standards. Mainly, we want to reduce the time it takes for regulatory processes and approvals. The commission has worked on this and must continue to improve. For example, there were approval processes that took 180 days that today only take 60 days. But we must reduce these times further. We will also carry out a process of improving regulations and coordinating processes with ASEA. We aim to be facilitators and allow companies to start producing in the short term the highest volume possible. Right now, five out of the 35 companies who won contracts in the rounds are already producing. We expect another five to start the extraction phase in 2020. We have not held any new bidding rounds, due to the policy implemented by the Secretary of Energy. Some 112 contracts were tendered previously, so we will not add any new ones in 2020. Once they start production, there will be more income from oil operations for the Fondo Mexicano del Petroleo (FMP), which will be a new source of income for federation. This will likely influence the decision of whether or not new bidding rounds will be held in the future.</p><p><strong>What are the main plans for the Pemex exploration fields in 2020?<br></strong>There are authorized plans for the 17 priority fields that maintain a stable production for Pemex. Most of the fields that Pemex is exploiting are in a declining phase and have surpassed the maximum curve of production. In order to maintain production levels, we need to start working these new fields urgently. These will enter a growth phase in 2020, and production will increase. In order to reach the goal for the end of the year, they will need to also work on other new fields.</p><p><strong>In terms of extraction and exploration, in what ways is the oil and gas sector incorporating new technologies and more sustainable methods?</strong><br>In terms of exploration, technology allows us to better estimate and find out if there is oil in a given location. 1P and 2P exist to determine the degree of likelihood to find oil in a certain area. There are satellite techniques and diverse seismic studies that help determine with higher certainty if there are hydrocarbons in place. In theory, this should reduce extraction and exploration costs, and reduce hydrocarbon prices in the long term. Technology helps the industry be more competitive. Projects that are currently in the exploration phase have a higher chance of finding wells than in the past; however, in the long term, the hydrocarbon industry will transition to gas because there are many investments to use gas to produce electricity, while also transitioning to renewable energies such as solar or wind.</p><p><strong>What is the future of oil in the world's broader energy transition?</strong><br>It will depend on what the largest economies do. Eventually, we know that fossil fuels will stop being used because they are a limited resource. The US has said that we will use fuels until 2050, but there are some studies in Europe that say they will stop being used sooner. We have not reached the point where the world can function on renewable energies alone, but we eventually will. The current issues with solar and wind are that they are not available 24/7. Our role is to follow up on the current contracts with companies and Pemex's production. With all of these contracts, we have information on how much each operator produces, which allows us to have a complete overview of the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your perspective of the mining sector in Mexico?<br></strong>Our sector is a responsible one; the mining industry is safe and responsible. We, as a company, have extremely high safety standards. We have reached up to 800 days without any accidents in our mines. The company expects overall stability in 2020. In particular, everyone has to focus on working on their productivity. Extraction will not stop. What we are doing as a company is focusing internally to work on safety, quality, and productivity issues. That is linked to the maintenance issue. 2020 looks good. We are working in Guerrero, Chihuahua, Nuevo León, and Zacatecas mainly. In 2020, we have three job prospects: two in Zacatecas and one in Guerrero. Now, we are focused on the development of human capital and its technical development. We are looking for business alliances with suppliers. We have several made with people from Finland and Chile and are in talks with a German group. Above all, we focus on service and profitability. We are strengthening ourselves internally to continue growing.</p><p><strong>What are your goals in terms of national and international expansion in the medium term?<br></strong>Now, our short-term plan for the next two years is focused on human resources, personal development, and development and maintenance. Subsequently, we plan to start with an expansion outside the country. We have already seen prospects in Peru, Colombia, and Chile, though nothing has been finalized. Our focus for 2020 and 2021 will be on human capital. We have several areas of opportunity to work in. We also have to work on maintenance.</p><p><strong>Could you explain your experience as a founder of a mining company in Mexico?<br></strong>We started the company 12 years ago. We come from a mining family; there was an opportunity in the sector, and we took it. We started with small offices and have grown since. Today, we have 348 people in the company. We were recently certified as a socially responsible company for the sixth consecutive year, which we are extremely proud of. We currently have a board of directors that governs the company. I am the CEO in addition to the founding partner of the company. The council gives a great deal of financial and fiscal stability to the company. We currently have a business in construction. We also have precast, transportation, and food, though this is our main company. I am the general manager of this company focused on mining, though I am also a partner of several of the others in the group. In each company, there is a leader.</p><p><strong>Compared to your competitors, what is your added value?<br></strong>We are a company that does not depend on a single person. We are a board of directors, and we also have solid bases. The council determines the investments and growth and also takes great care of the financing and profitability of each project. We look at each project individually to specifically analyze the performance of each and do not seek to obscure the success of one with the failure of another. We give financial autonomy to each company, which is an advantage we have. With customers, we are a socially responsible company. Our function is to provide customer service. We are mainly a service company. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your general vision as subsecretary of mining?<br></strong>The current administration looks at mining not only as a sector that can generate jobs and economic activity in remote regions but as a competitive lever for manufacturing in the country. Mexico is a manufacturing power. The industrial sector in Mexico can benefit from locally extracted mining inputs such as copper, silver, or iron. We want the sector to generate foreign exchange through exports and become a source of competitiveness when integrated into other manufacturing chains across the country. We believe in a future dominated by electromobility and other similar technologies. All of this will require certain metals and minerals, which is why it is crucial to develop a strong mining industry. Mexico is a large producer of metals and minerals and has important metal deposits with great potential such as lithium, gold, silver, copper, zinc, and nickel. We want the mining sector to be a lever of competitiveness for productive chains rather than just being an export sector. We do not want a forced integration to maximize national content, but an integration that generates value and competitiveness. </p><p><strong>What can Mexico do to become more competitive over other mining markets in the region?<br></strong>The most relevant cost and risk elements are paperwork, security, and road infrastructure, and we have dedicated ourselves to improving these risk elements for mining operations in Mexico. Additionally, insecurity is a multidimensional issue that greatly impacts companies, which involves unions, local authorities, and communities. We are working in a coordinated effort to improve the security situation. The process becomes easier if the companies have a security specialist with sufficient decision-making power to carry out initiatives jointly with us. We have made important advances by connecting with certain counterparts that are informed and have the decision-making power to operate together.<br> <br><strong>Another challenge facing Mexico is the lack of large mines being developed to replace depleting projects. What is needed in Mexico to further promote investment in exploration?</strong><br>This is a global trend and phenomenon. In Mexico, it is already several years old. To address it, the Mexican Ecological Service has redefined its strategy to act not only as a deposit of technical, scientific, or geological information but also as a lever of competitiveness for the mining sector, by generating useful information. Second, we are aware that exploration activities in Mexico are not immediately deductible as a tax expense. Investors also lack confidence in the rules. This distrust is justified to some extent because in the recent past, previously marginalized actors have been empowered. We must reach agreements with these newly empowered players on how to build an environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive mining sector.<br> <br><strong>What are your goals for 2020?</strong><br>We will continue improving the permit process. We want a simple procedure where there is minimal human intervention to prevent corruption. To that end, we are working on a digital system. We want the same to happen with the regulations that exist outside our direct field of action, as they also affect mining. We are working with other government authorities to do this. We are evaluating mechanisms for the solution of bottlenecks so that a struck project is treated in the most practical way possible. In 2020, we will continue consolidating a system of coordination between dependencies and the government.<br> <br><strong>What support can investors expect from the public sector?<br></strong>We are committed to the development and growth of the mining sector in Mexico, and investors can expect timely support from us. We have assembled a team that can offer timely support in matters of security, tax, operations, communication, community relations, compliance, and environmental protection. We are applying a practical approach to promote projects. We are convinced of the value and potential of the mining sector and are willing to do everything to ensure the success of mining projects in Mexico. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does new technology help oil and gas companies cope with situations like the COVID-19 pandemic?<br></strong>The virus is a new reality for people, companies, and governments that not only requires adjustments in our lives in relation to health, but also entails greater responsibility for people's lives. That is why it is so necessary to act proactively by promoting policies, protocols, processes and flows of action that allow us to minimize risks. For us, as a leader in this industry, it is essential to maintain a quality safety and environment management system, because today more than ever industries have to work under high quality standards that guarantee the health of employees and stakeholders. SERTECPET has implemented a robust management system, with certifications issued by the American Petroleum Institute (API), including the 7CL, Q1, and Q2 standards. Additionally, we have a quality system ISO 9001, 14001 and OSHAS 18001 certified by Lloyds of London and approved by the API. Today, we are the only company in the world that has the 18 LCM standard, which involves the management of the life cycle from beginning to end. We are the ninth company in the world with API 19AC certification, which is for the design of downhole tools. Our management model helps us to focus permanently on continuous improvement, thus allowing us to go beyond the attribute of the product and service, adding high value to our customers, increasing its technological component, the efficiency and effectiveness of our processes, and generating innovations in our different lines of business. This becomes indispensable in this situation where the pandemic forces us to reinvent ourselves much faster.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the experience of SERTECPET in the renewable energy sector?<br></strong>Oil companies are transforming themselves into energy companies, by investing resources in the development of renewable energies. Our organization has decided to expand its core business based on our know-how and installed capacities to face the global need to reduce the carbon footprint and simultaneously contribute to clean energy projects. Our 2040 vision is to become a generator of technology that contributes to the generation of renewable energy. For this, we have placed SERTECPET Energy Holdings in Madrid, because, strategically, Europe has more resources, technology, and commitment to the development of renewable energies.</p><p><strong>Pemex is among the customers of SERTECPET in Mexico. What opportunities do you see in the Mexican market?<br></strong>Mexico is an important player in the oil and gas market; it has a solid industry and capacity to export several products. It is worth noting that Mexico not only exports oil but a whole range of manufactured products, especially in North America. Since we arrived in 2005, we have believed in Mexico's potential for our company. Pemex had an excellent record when we started participating in its artificial lift projects with our SMART Jet Claw system and with our integrated service with the Mobil Testing Unit, accompanied by our SYAL software. In addition, we have designed specific tools for wells with problems at the bottom. Now we are interested in both EPC projects and offshore fields, where the benefits will be substantial. As a company and industry supported by local production of the highest quality, generating productive linkages, employment, transparency, technology and contribution to the economy, we are ready more than ever to invest much more. Our philosophy of working alone or in partnership allows us to add more value to the country. People, companies, governments, and countries need to see beyond the everyday to anticipate the future and live the era of disruption. Today, quality is measured by the capacity for change, adaptation, and evolution of the product to the requirements of an ever-changing market. SERTECPET is commited to providing quality services in all markets, based on best practices, allowing us to build solid partnerships to obtain greater value for all parties.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pandemic affected Al Masaood Oil &amp; Gas company?</h4><p>The first effect is the human factor, or the fear of getting the virus. Al Masaood Oil &amp; Gas cares deeply about its employees and their health and safety. First and foremost, we are a service company, and our people are our most important asset. We set the tone for our employees, and this optimistic outlook is facilitated by the government's guidelines. In addition to government precautions, our clients, including ADNOC and its subsidiaries and other IOCs, implement extra safety measures that we need to consider. This was a top priority for us, even if it means we have to work at lower capacity. We came up with an agreement with ADNOC that involved keeping employees onsite and moving them only according to the service orders we got on rigs. That was successful in terms of mitigating the risk of movement and transferring contagions to other sites. The government has been consistent in supporting the private sector and family businesses through its initiatives, particularly those that reduce the cost of doing business. Banks also supported us for our employees, especially in terms of postponing payments for those with loans. A lot of credit goes to this country, which I consider the best in the world. We live in a haven—both business- and people-wise. We have adapted in many ways and maintained a positive outlook.</p><h4>How has the pandemic pushed you to optimize costs?</h4><p>Cost optimization does not come from sacrificing the human factor. I think about giving my people a push to adapt to change by reducing expenses, monitor costs, business and market diversification, bring more sales, bring more services, and increase the profitability of the company. Some international and national oil companies have requested a discount in these times of uncertainty, and we provided discounts but not at the cost of deducting salaries or the quality of services we perform. I proposed a salary retention plan to the board members and immediately received approval. Reducing salaries would demotivate employees and spread negativity, ruining the work environment and culture that we have been building for the past five years. Instead, we followed a salary retention plan against our targets and budget for 2020. I advised everyone to control their expenses and consumer bills, in addition to spare parts and whatever else we utilize during these three months to keep costs at a minimum, increase sales and revenue, and in the end retain the same budget numbers with discounts for clients. So far, that has been going smoothly. Our expenses over the second quarter 2020 have been reduced by 35% without cutting any salaries. For instance, many employees are working from home, so we were able to remove some allowances where applicable. We had a lot of savings on fuel consumption, transportation, and accommodation. What's more, worker productivity has gone up now that we have switched to working from home. Large facility management companies and landlords here have given discounts of their own volition. Other measures my team and I have taken in terms of cash flow and financial strengths, as well as negotiations with banks for discount rates and extra facilities that would help us in the new market trends where traders are in need to increase their cash flow, this  have helped as well. Altogether, have put us in great shape, and we believe we can sustain our business for a better future.</p><h4>How has your company leveraged and accelerated the integration of technology in this new business environment?</h4><p>I have always believed in technology and its positive impact on business. Al Masaood Oil &amp; Gas started an internal initiative four years ago to transfer all of our in-house transactions to digital technology. We started at the beginning with the sales, finance, PR, HR, marketing, legal and compliance, and ethics departments. Then we moved into the service division. It makes us well prepared for any type of business uncertainty or failure in business. We can track it, investigate, work on the, proper solution, and rectify the issue. We have been successful in doing that for the last two years once we completed the ERP process. This technology and the video conferences made us very connected during this period so that we could stay up to date on what is happening. Today, large contracts are being signed via video conferences. Students are graduating via video conferences. Many government agreements are being made in video conferences. Large UN meetings are happening over video conference. It is legitimate now, and people are changing their mindset around technology.</p><h4>What is your immediate mid-term plan to mitigate the risk of the effects we'll see in 4Q2020?</h4><p>To mitigate the risk of the effect of this wave of the pandemic, we have to consider business practices before the pandemic and after as completely different. You cannot plan, design budgets, and set up targets the same way we did before. We are in a market of adapting to change. Most of our sales—from mechanical, electrical, and chemical supplies and so on—have been affected due to shipping and the closure of ports and airports. Companies have had two approaches: wait for things to go back to the way they were before or adapt and shape the future. From day one, we were selling products and solutions that could prevent and detect COVID-19 or protect people. That was very successful. There were incentives, and they got paid through those. Everyone was motivated, and we paid Q1 and Q2 2020 sales incentives even during the challenging time. They will be paid for Q3 and Q4 2020 on time as well, as long as they meet their targets and budgeted revenues. The business practices overall are different than they were before, and that will affect us negatively or positively, depending on the leadership of every company. I am capturing the innovation, the power of being optimistic, and taking these initiatives with the support and blessings of our board members, who are all always positive and strongly believe in the UAE government vision and the economy along with ADNOC's vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the role of Mexico in the global business strategy of the company?<br></strong>Mexico is extremely important to the company. Kelly's Mexico operations are ranked between fifth and seventh out of all the group's global operations. Kelly has been operating in Mexico for 30 years across 17 industries. The industries with the greatest investment are automotive, aerospace, high technology, science, natural resources, and finance. We work in these six industries, which is why we have over 12,000 employees in Mexico. We do not have physical facilities throughout the country, but representatives. We have operations on site, and this sets us apart. Since we are close to our clients, we understand the needs of the client and look at how to evolve our services.</p><p><strong>How does the new labor reform affect the industries where you have presence?<br></strong>The labor reform has extremely positive benefits. More than 500 articles mainly related to labor justice and freedom of association were reformed. This is a consequence of the USMCA, the new trade agreement between Mexico, the US, and Canada. Freedom of association puts all three players on equal footing and allows them to compete with other regions of the world in better conditions.</p><p><strong>What is the next step for Kelly in Mexico when it comes to human resources?<br></strong>The world of work is changing, and at Kelly, we are aware that we have to keep up if we want to be successful. After 73 years in the market, Kelly Services is ready to identify the way people wants to work today and rebrand accordingly. We believe in promoting independent and non-traditional working styles to match the new workforce dynamic. People today are searching for experiences, knowledge, and a company whose values matches theirs. We must accept that today's talent is much more qualified. The new generation does not live to work but works to live.</p><p><strong>What has been the response of national and international companies in Mexico to non-traditional work structures?<br></strong>The independent work scheme is different from the flexible work scheme. Independent work in Mexico has certain limitations because it is not regulated. One of the reasons why organizations do not adopt independent workstyles is that they are afraid of being non-compliant. On the other hand, they have not understood it culturally, and subsequently have not developed processes that help in its implementation. In Mexico, organizations seek to promote formal work and then move toward non-traditional work styles. Mexico has already taken the first step as a country. Article 311 of the Federal Labor Law considers telecommuting or home office. We are evolving in that direction, though we cannot promote independent work until it is properly legislated. We are behind in comparison to other countries, but we are well on our way. Notably, Kelly Services surveyed more than 200 decision-makers in different industries in the Middle East, Europe, Africa, Asia Pacific, and America and found that 65% of those decision-makers employ independent workers. Asia Pacific is the most developed region in this field, followed by the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region and Latin America. Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico are more developed than the US in this regard. Today, one-third of the world's workers are freelancers. According to statistics, in the next five years, work on demand will grow by almost 20%. Modern workers want to invest in their training and development and look for work-life balance.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for Mexico for 2020?<br></strong>Mexico's economy grew by 0.3% in 4Q2018 and 0.1% in 1Q2019. 2019 did not represent a growth in sales, but a growth in productivity and efficiency. For 2020, we have a conservative, single-digit growth target. We hope the stability generated by the actions of the government will be reflected in the economy. The Mexican business sector supports the government, and the government is keen to maintain a healthy dialogue with the sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What methods did the company use to finally break its production benchmark of 1 million tons of copper in 2019 for the first time?<br></strong>There will always be potential for mining growth in Mexico, Peru, and the US. We have seven open-pit mines: two in Mexico, two in Peru, and three in the US in Arizona. Our production in 2019 was, for the first time, over 1 million tons of copper, due to the completed expansion of the second concentrator in Toquepala. This added expansion allowed us to increase our production by 100,000 tons, leading to a grand total of over 1 million tons.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations for production in 2020?<br></strong>We have about the same expectations as 2019. We have three investments in Mexico. One of those will be Buenavista Zinc, where we found zinc inside copper. This material needs to be processed in a new concentrator, which will increase production and total income in our underground mines in Mexico. The construction of the new concentrator is due to start 2020 and is expected to be completed in two years with an investment of approximately USD480 million.</p><p><strong>Are you still contemplating entering new markets such as Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile?<br></strong>We are exploring market opportunities in the mining sector in three other countries. We are currently exploring the opportunity of turning a project in Ecuador into a copper mine. We have not made a final decision; however, we need to evaluate the long-term benefits, as this important investment could add a lot to our company. At the moment, we are exploring possibilities and trying to prove it will be a substantial project.</p><p><strong>How will COVID-19 impact your production and performance in 2020?<br></strong>We cannot deny the fact this global pandemic is affecting our sector, but Americas Mining Corporation, on the other hand, already sold 80-85% of its production to Chinese companies in October 2019. The only inconvenience we have encountered is the change of distribution dates, as some companies are suggesting that we do not send the product according to the previous timelines already set up. Apart from that, COVID-19 has not been a huge problem, since we have already signed the contracts. We will send our production following a different timeline than expected, and we hope it will not cause any further problems.</p><p><strong>What does the mining industry in Mexico need to become more competitive?<br></strong>We already consider Mexico to be competitive. We are achieving higher production levels in Mexico compared to Peru, mainly in Buenavista del Cobre. Moreover, due to the addition of a new concentrator, we were able to increase our production by more than 100,000 tons of copper. This addition helped us achieve the over 1 million tons we produced in 2019. Out of our total production, 60% comes from Mexico and 40% comes from Peru. Currently, we have three pending projects in Peru: Tí­a Marí­a, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay, all with different starting dates. In Mexico, we have the Buenavista mine, which is centered on zinc extraction. Furthermore, we have an upcoming small mine project, El Pilar, in Mexico, which is expected to produce 30,000 tons of copper. El Pilar project will start in 2020 and will take at least 1.5 years to produce the amount of copper we expect. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Braskem Idesa ensuring it has a stable supply of feedstock for its operations?<br></strong>It is critical to have access to competitive feedstock from the US. The US is a competitive country in terms of feedstock, especially in natural gas and ethane due to the shale gas phenomenon, which paved the way for new investments there in natural gas, ethane, and petrochemical plants. We are working on a fast-track solution for importing ethane gas using trucks initially. Then, we intend to support a permanent storage terminal connected with pipelines, power plants, and Pemex facilities so we can share this terminal with Pemex. The number-one priority is to support Pemex and the government to recover local production of feedstock because Mexico has all the conditions to produce natural gas and ethane; however, this will take some time, so we need to support our operation in the meantime by importing, which has two phases. We are almost at the first phase, namely fast-tracking using trucks to import feedstock. The second phase is the terminal concept, a two-and-a-half-year project. The entire country needs this feedstock for many industries and products. Currently, we are running at around 72% of our capacity. Other players are closing plants or reducing their production significantly. With our natural resources and proximity to the US, we have the potential and the market to recover our position. We are working with the National Association of the Chemical Industry (ANIQ), the Business Coordinating Council (CCE), and other entities supporting the industry to have positive dialogue with the government and find a solid recovery plan for Mexico.</p><p><strong>How are you implementing Mexico's vision of the circular economy?<br></strong>In November 2018, we published our voluntary commitment to the objectives we want to reach as a plastics industry. We have set priorities around technology development, education, and agreements with clients and the government. The circular economy is a process that should be implemented across the entire plastics chain from producers to converters, plant owners to the government, and the general public. Alignment among all stakeholders will represent the success of this initiative. We are close to launching a recyclable post-consumption resin (PCR) that has a certain content of recycled material; this is an example of the circular economy. We have partnerships with recycling companies in Mexico responsible for collecting waste in cities, and we will guarantee the quality of these recycled products. Mexico has great potential to implement this type of circular economy. We already have extensive experience in PET and high-density polythene, as we produce it here. We started this strategy to protect the environment and continue to educate the community on this as part of our social commitment.</p><p><strong>What were some 2019 highlights, and what are your main priorities for 2020?<br></strong>In 2019, Mexico saw a new administration, which means a new environment for the industry. After some doubts and lack of interaction at the beginning of this administration, we now see a new approach. 2019 was when the private sector got to know the administration better and vice versa. For 2020, the main priority is to have a feedstock solution. Second, we are focused on the circular economy and developing better products and services, as well as doing many education programs. This is really a huge priority for us. In the future, I see Mexico as a hub for circular economy products due to its capabilities with low-cost production and competitive exports as well as its experience in PET and other kinds of recycling processes. We are putting in great effort into this because we see Mexico's potential. We want to continue to grow the region based on that. Even a year ago, plastics were seen as a huge enemy, and now the discussion and opportunities are changing. Society is beginning to understand the relevance of plastics in our lives and of post-consumption management of these products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why does Samsung release the first wave of many of its products in the Mexican market? <br></strong>Mainly because Mexico has been a key market for us for a long time thanks to the preference and loyalty of our users making us the number one brand in the country with 35% of the market share. In addition, Mexico is one of the few countries worldwide where this type of testing is done. Mexico is lucky to have an open market with many diverse products and brands. Concerning technology, it is one of the most competitive countries in the world where you find fans of any brand in almost any sector. The Mexican population invests in technology, and they will choose the best in the market. That is the main difference in Mexico compared to other countries.</p><p> <br><strong>Samsung Mexico grew by 16% in 2019. What factors helped to achieve this growth?<br></strong>To grow in this industry, investing in innovation is key. Annually we invest around USD14 billion in R&amp;D not only to keep our leadership but also to increase it. In 2019, Samsung presented a foldable smartphone, making us first brand in the country that had a commercially available foldable phone. We were also the first country to introduce Samsung Kids to the market, a service that provides streaming for children. We renewed Samsung Pay, a service that allows users to use their phone as a credit card to pay for services. Another key point was the wearables portfolio that, with a wider offer, helped us to grow in revenue. In addition, in the last two years we have opened 27 stores across the country. In e-commerce, we went from 0% to double-digits in 2019 with our online Samsung Store. <br>  <br><strong>What will be your focus when it comes to diversification in 2020? <br></strong>Our main priority is to position the brand differently in our distribution channels. We want our online and offline distribution channels to grow. The second is to grow with our business partners. We especially want to grow with financial tools through banks. Currently, car leasing is strong. Imagine doing this with cell phones. We are starting a program that allows our customers to trade their phones for newer models. It works almost like a membership for which you pay every 12 months to have the newest phone. These are the kinds of tools we are going to bring to the market. We want to help our Samsung lovers to experience our innovation immediately. We will have at least two or three financial tools with banks and partners so customers can change their phones every 12 months. That is our main strategy for 2021.</p><p><strong>When are you launching your first 5G phone? <br></strong>We have already launched our first 5G-ready phone, the Galaxy S20 Ultra, which was also the first 5G smartphone in Mexico. 5G networks will be up to 100 times faster than 4G networks but we are aware that the 5G revolution is not just about speed; it is about preparation for smart cities, smart cars, and smart homes. It is the preparation to do all types of businesses, houses, and smart industries that are expected to yield USD2.2 trillion in GDP worldwide according to a GSMA report. As an example, when you are using your phone with 5G, you are downloading or uploading information at a speed of about 1GB per second. It means that you are downloading almost one movie per second. This kind of speed prepares society for the making of a smart city. You will be able to see all traffic lights from a tablet or see how the subway works. City planners will also be able to control the lights, thereby lowering costs. This marks a new phase for Samsung, end-users, governments, countries, and the car industry. 5G is one of our priorities worldwide, and Mexico is part of this revolution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What added value does Lennken Group's app offer compared to others?<br></strong>After the app launch, we put in a great deal of research development and investment into its processes. The main issue we face with the app is not only the end-to-end point of communication but also knowing the process itself and its major issues, such as fraud prevention. The other issue is integration with the third parties that the insurance company has in the process already. Administration and control of the whole process requires attention, for example, when configuring the ERP system in the back office of the insurance company and the valuation process to determine the value of the crash and cost of repairs. You have to integrate the third parties, so it is not only the ability to perform the process in the application, but the ability to know the process and do it in a more integrated, faster, and cheaper way. Before we approach companies, we do a business case before we make a sale and perform this with the insurance company with our financial and insurance specialists. If we agree that the business case works well with their objectives, we put a budget in place based on the financial decision. We have three of the biggest insurance clients, which is why we have more traffic accidents than our competitors.</p><p><strong>Is the company's main focus insurance companies or does it also serve other sectors?<br></strong>The Lennken Group has 13 business units in the group, and we are extremely integrated with a customer-centric strategy. We placed the customer at the center and then took a 360-degree look to understand how to solve possible problems and issues, which could be human resources, digitalization, mobile enablement, or even simple services like the integration of security issues or ERP. The main strategy is to be specialized in some sectors, but we have the necessity and capability to do it with different types of clients. Currently, we have more than 200 active customers. We have performed 1,116 projects since we first appeared in the market 17 years ago.</p><p><strong>Where is IT talent clustered in Mexico?<br></strong>In Mexico, there are five clusters of IT experts: Mexico City's metropolitan area, Monterrey, Guadalajara, Querétaro, and Mérida, which is not entering the IT sector. There are some gaps in terms of the salaries, experience, and capabilities of the five regions. If we want to retain our people, we need to give them more challenges and experiences with different customers instead of providing higher salaries. Having a career path within a company does not happen much in the IT sector, where experienced staff try to earn more money by changing companies, but this results in the average tenure of staff being two or three years. We tackle this first with our software factory in Sonora, which is growing, though not as quickly as Monterrey or Guadalajara. This means we can slow down the average to four or five years. In three or four years, we can provide training and bring them into a different level of skill and capabilities.</p><p><strong>What are the priorities for growth in the medium to long term and in which sectors in particular?<br></strong>The first will be industries in which the COVID-19 pandemic is bringing challenges we need to solve with digital transformation. For example, all small and medium retailers were unable to quickly provide digital end-to-end solutions, meaning there are many opportunities there. Another will be companies that have to control mobile processes, like companies with many technicians. Another area will be healthcare, specifically concerning issues such as going to a doctor or a hospital, or requiring medical attention. There are also providers that are not well-linked that need to have connections to the healthcare industry. There is a healthcare, logistics, and technology gap that needs to be addressed, and we have a strategy to penetrate this market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you elaborate on Mexico's role in the company's strategy?<br></strong>Mexico and Spanish-speaking Latin America are extremely important for the company because the region generates a great deal of value for the company. We are not at the revenue levels of other regions, such as North America or Brazil. Mexico within Spanish-speaking Latin America has the largest revenues. Mexico is also a hub for technology. We have many services for digital transformation, and Mexico is key due to its close relation with the US. It is part of the nearshore approach that the company has for North America, South America, and other parts of the world. Today, amid this turmoil, Mexico is extremely important for Latam and all regions where Stefanini works.</p><p><strong>What added value do you offer?<br></strong>We are convinced that companies are evolving in terms of efficiency and quality toward digital transformation. Most businesses are convinced that digital transformation is just acquiring new technology, though that is not the case. This transformation starts with culture and people, which we at Stefanini consider one of the most important challenges. We must ensure that companies understand that a mindset change is required to correctly implement the digital transformation. Since 2008, we have invested in developing an innovation ecosystem that includes technology accelerators or mechanisms to change businesses' mindsets. That is the first step needed for digital transformation and is the most important part of the process.</p><p><strong>What is the biggest challenge that digital transformation faces in Mexico?<br></strong>Companies need to realize they first need to work on cultural challenges before starting to implement digital strategies. In addition, it is important to correctly define a transformational roadmap that allows companies to be supported by companies like ours. In addition to those challenges, we are in a volatile and uncertain scenario that is extremely challenging. We should make sure companies are convinced that the transformation process is required, and they need to be entrepreneurial in order to succeed.</p><p><strong>How has the company fared during the COVID-19 crisis?<br></strong>Our most important projects are connected to the banking sector, and we have launched many solutions for our clients during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 60% of our revenues come from large banking groups, including stock brokers, insurance companies, and banks. We provide more than 1 million hours annually to these companies collectively to maintain applications. We mostly focus on three areas—the financial sector, retail, and pharmaceuticals—which has ensured the company has been barely affected by the pandemic. Though manufacturing industry has been impacted, that has not been our case, because our clients can work remotely.</p><p><strong>What services do you offer to Mexico through new technologies?<br></strong>We have a service called “Bank in a Box," which has matured more in Brazil because we have a call center related to the management of credit and debit cards. We have also a venture that offers microfinances services and prevention of money laundering. Through that, we have created a marketplace that is large enough to offer many combined services. We have also reinforced our cybersecurity services, which is becoming extremely profitable in the challenging current environment.<br>What is the advantage of being a Latam-based technology company versus a company based in the US or Europe?<br>We are a global player, but with a Latin American approach. We are extremely competitive; we have great solutions and work with some of the best brands in the market and the largest companies in the world. A value that has distinguished us is that we always have an agnostic approach. Our motto is something along the lines of "Falling in love with the problem and looking together for the best solution." We know our advantages, but perhaps a client does not need the solution we might offer, but a different one. Thus, we should always offer an agnostic approach and focus on user experience. We always end up choosing the best solution for each client.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the factors behind the triple digit growth numbers that Mercado Libre is seeing in the market?<br></strong>They are the external drivers, like people searching for PPE, masks, antibacterial gels, gloves, and so on; hence, there was a spike from March 2020 onward after phase one of the COVID-19 emergency in Mexico. We have a base of 2 million sellers just in Mexico and more than 11 million in the region, with sellers adjusting quite quickly to demand. Therefore, our recent growth was due more to the pandemic. A more long-term factor of our growth is our strategy of focusing on logistics and fulfillment solutions. We have warehouses in Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina. In Mexico, we have 130,000sqm of warehouses. Our footprint allows us to have thousands of sellers who can store their products, while Mercado Libre handles everything from storage to shipment. That is a service that enables thousands of SMEs and large companies to operate professionally in e-commerce without having to invest in their own warehouses or logistics systems.</p><p><strong>How many visits have you registered in Mexico, and how are you expanding into other e-solutions? <br></strong>Our app and platform receive more than 10 million visits daily. There are more than 6,000 searches made every second on the platform, with 13 products sold every second. As we know our customers' interests, what they look at, what they buy, and where they live, we can use this information to run personalized ad campaigns and increase the relevance of the searched content, which is what our ad sales solution Mercado Publicidad does. We have a fintech solution with Mercadopago, which is an online payment processor that companies can use for their own e-commerce. We also offer an account that allows people to pay for services like gas, electricity, phone bills, and even send money. Recently, we have the created an asset management solution with Grupo Bursátil Mexicano, whereby the balance in your digital wallet generates revenue through an investment fund. In 2019, we launched credit solutions, with more than 2 million credit lines to consumers currently. In Mexico, there are more than 54 million adults outside the formal financial sector. The democratization of money will come through the mobile phone, because everyone has a smartphone. Thus, all our solutions are available through a smartphone.</p><p><strong>How sustainable are the levels of Mercado Libre's recent growth, and what strategies is the company using to maintain them?<br></strong>In the past 10 weeks, Mercado Libre acquired more than five million new customers in the region. In Mexico, that number is over 1 million, and we grew orders by 112%. The best strategy is to give those customers a positive experience in all steps of the process so they will return. We see a steep increase in purchasing frequency among all customer segments, so out of our most loyal customers, more than 70% purchased again within the past 10 weeks. Looking at low frequency buyers who previously bought once a year, they now buy that same volume of purchases in less than a month. So, purchasing frequency is increasing across all customer segments. Of course, part of the growth is driven by the lockdown, with stores closing and people remaining at home. Total e-commerce to retail penetration in Mexico is around 4.9%, while in the US and Europe, it is more like 15%. As our base is still low, the present is simply an acceleration of the natural transition already taking place, which will cause a high convergence for customers who will expect digitalization from retailers. Certainly, people will continue to go to malls and shop because they want to entertain themselves and their families on the weekend. However, maybe they will realize it is more convenient to order products online during the week.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What strategies is Danone Mexico using to maintain popularity and hold consumers' interest in Mexico?<br></strong>Customers' attention spans are getting shorter. We used to make 30-second commercials, and now we only have six seconds. We are active in the digital environment. Obviously, we are investing in getting quality data, so we can become closer to our customers. Today, we do not talk about consumers; we talk about demographic “tribes." We speak differently about the same brand to different tribes, such as vegans versus high-performance athletes. At Danone, we are careful that our brands have a clear umbrella, message, and social agenda. Then, we break our audience down with key messages that make our products relevant to them. In terms of maintaining growth, our strategy is more innovation. One of the things we have learned is that innovation cycles are much shorter than previously. Once you have something out there, you better be ready to change yourself, rather than be changed by the market.</p><p><strong>Why is Mexico such an attractive market for plant-based products?<br></strong>Mexico is the only country in Latin America where there is a plant-based business. In Brazil, we are on a growth trajectory, but it is still small. In Argentina and Uruguay, where we have just introduced it, the category is pretty much non-existent. Mexico tends to get new things because of its proximity to the US. American-made, plant-based products are well-established. This category started in Mexico around 10 years ago. Danone acquired Silk in 2017. We measure penetration in terms of how many households are using a particular category of product. In Mexico, penetration for plant-based products is still small, with only 10% of Mexican households buying a plant-based product once a year. </p><p><strong>What strategies are you using to increase household consumption of plant-based products?<br></strong>First, we are diversifying the number of flavor options we offer. We started with almond and soy, and we now have coconut, oat, and mixed nuts. Plant-based products are an acquired taste, as people are not used to them. We are also starting to offer a wider range of products. We started with milk, but now we have both “spoonable" and drinkable yogurt. We are introducing ice cream and ready-to-drink coffee options. By amplifying the number of options we offer, buying this category of products becomes more natural.</p><p><strong>What other new products is Danone Mexico launching in 2019-2020?<br></strong>In 2019, we launched a high protein brand called YoPro, both a dairy and plant-based version, designed for people who exercise on a regular basis. In Mexico, there is a high rate of lactose intolerance and many people who do not want dairy in their diet. It is challenging for vegans to get enough protein, so we have developed a formula using a combination of soy and chickpeas. At the same time, we are overhauling a number of our existing brands. We are also launching a line of yogurts inspired by fruits from Mexico's many regions. These yogurts will be made by Mexican milk, our own natural cultures, and a touch of agave, to make a unique Mexican product. We are also continually improving Activia, with our new Activia Shots containing 2 billion probiotics in only 100ml. In kids' products, we launched jelly pouches under the Dany brand and even have a spicy version that caters to the Mexican market.</p><p><strong>What actions are being implemented under Danone's One Planet One Health campaign?<br></strong>A great local example is the Margarita Project, which has developed practices to make small milk producers profitable. Today, 18% of the milk we buy comes from those Margarita farmers. We just signed a contract for Bimbo to join us in the development of this project. We have also started a scheme to help small farmers who grow the strawberries we use in our products here. These are two examples of where we actively lead the One Planet agenda.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why did you decide to create a company that focuses on technology innovation? <br></strong>The mission of this company is to create innovative products that transform the payroll and human capital processes with the best technology. We have 33 years in the market, and we have introduced the Mexican market to a wide variety of new products. We established new benchmarks in the market that other companies have followed. One example was the cloud market. We were one of the first to provide these services in Mexico, and we now have 17 years of experience in the cloud market. It was difficult because in the beginning many companies did not believe in cloud services. People were wary of sharing their data with us, but our company remained firm in its belief in the cloud, even when nobody knew the cloud market. We now have 1.2 million employees on our cloud network and provide these services for 700 companies in Latin America. In Mexico, we provide these services to 200 different firms. We started with Latin America in 2016, and we opened the Colombia office in 2019.</p><p><strong>What technology is going to be the company's next milestone?<br></strong>At this moment, we have an app called Human eTime designed to register employees' start times and finish times in a simple and functional way using their own smartphone or using a tablet provided by the company. Our simple system allows you to take a selfie when you arrive at the office, and another when you leave. We developed this app through facial recognition and other life detection technologies. The app can even tell if a non-authorized user is trying to pass off as another individual by using a picture. In fact, our system improves the facial recognition technology. In some countries in Europe, such as Spain, it is mandatory for all employees to check in when they start and check out when they leave. Therefore, Human eTime is being launched not only in Latin America, but also Spain.</p><p><strong>What is the company's top priority right now?<br></strong>We have another product called 'Human WorkSocial,' available as desktop and mobile applications, where employees can check corporate communication, sign payroll receipts, request vacations, take online courses, chat with their co-workers, and many other things. It is like a layer that covers all the products of human application. If you want to implement work flows for HR authorizations, this app is easy to use. In 2020, Human WorkSocial will be re-launched with new features and a new design in May 2020. The app was first released around 2017.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to expand internationally?<br></strong>Most of our clients are international customers and include multinational companies that have operations in Latin America. They started to request our solution to process their payrolls in other countries in the most efficient way, and that is how we started to expand. For example, one of our clients is Avon; we are in charge of all of its payroll department in Mexico and the Dominican Republic. Additionally, Avon uses our cloud application in Colombia and Peru, and we are finishing its implementation in Ecuador. Another example is the company Aliaxis; we installed a shared service center in Costa Rica, where they process payrolls for 14 different countries. When we started to work with these types of companies, we saw the necessity to have an office in Colombia to create shared service centers and process payrolls of the Andean region including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations for 2020?<br></strong>We are a strong player in the HR market in Latin America, but I am pushing hard to enter more Latin American markets with more clients. We are also planning to make large investments in new products such as Human eTime and Human WorkSocial to keep bringing the latest technology to the market. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does the nearshore market represent for Teleperformance?<br></strong>Locally, the nearshore market represents more than 80% of our revenue and is close to being the highest growing market globally in this sector.  The nearshore region represents one of the largest footprints for the group in providing services to the US market. The US market represents just below 50% of the global market. In the Latin American market, Mexico is second after Brazil. Therefore, the domestic market in general is certainly valuable. We tend to seek opportunities through nearshore and offshore solutions because of labor arbitration, which leads to a more profitable service; however, local markets around the globe are also huge for the group. Speaking of the whole group, roughly 57% of our front-office (CEM) services are generated by local markets. Therefore, the Mexican market is extremely relevant, as we see numbers growing there despite a contracted economy. Part of our strategy is smart shoring, combining a wide variety of location offers, so we can better match our clients' needs with our solutions.</p><p><strong>What are Mexico's advantages and challenges compared to other competitive countries in the region developing this sector?<br></strong>Mexico is a huge country compared to other countries in Central America, which is an advantage from a labor availability perspective and thus, an operational scalability perspective. In addition, larger cities such as Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara are attractive markets for our industry. However, Mexico as a country relies more on other sectors and industries than other countries such as El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have all grown in the last five years in our industry because they have payed significant attention in it. All things being equal, there would not be a reason for us or our competitors to invest in Mexico, given the difference in government incentives. We have over 20,000 employees in Mexico, a country with over 20 times the population of El Salvador, and yet, we employ over 5,000 people in San Salvador. This proves how well incentives work to create jobs. The government is not paying attention to addressing the legal or regulatory changes required to make the industry thrive. Some laws are outdated and do not embrace or address digital transformation. Law changes must also consider the present work-at-home environment.</p><p><strong>What are your goals and targets for the remainder of 2020?<br></strong>The number-one priority will be to keep working from home, making it simpler, faster, and safer. Currently, we have more than 20,000 employees working at home in Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. In general, 2020 is going to be a tough time, not only because of COVID-19, but also because the GDP is trending downward. From the local market perspective, it will be complicated. But we will continue to provide a premium service. We will focus on increasing our footprint in the back office, as we want to penetrate more of that market. As the economy tightens more, companies will need to make their processes more efficient, so there is an opportunity.  We will also deploy assistant technology as much as possible in front office operations. We want to reduce costs for our clients and improve the experience of their customers. Given the pandemic, we are now looking to grow a high single digit in the Mexican market. We are increasing our offering in knowledge solutions such as analytics, showing our commitment to growth in that market. We already leverage our technology in processing and security. Given the amount of cyber attack incidents globally, companies will become more concerned. It is a complicated world from a security perspective. We will also continue our strong focus on our employees' satisfaction and happiness. Our strategy for the next three years is to accelerate our transformation from being a leading global group in customer experience outsource management to a leading global group in digitally integrated business services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is private participation in the Mexican energy market important, and how did that prompt Bravos Energia's establishment?<br></strong>The Mexican power sector has a long list of needed infrastructure, which will require capital and participation from companies with experience and technological expertise. Mexico needs about 70GW of new generation capacity over the next 15 years according to official government projections, and the public sector cannot finance and build all of that capacity by itself. Especially when it comes to renewables, participation from the private sector is essential, not just because of the diversity of expertise but also because of the private sector's ability to manage risk. The established processes for public-sector investment planning and budgeting are not well adapted to renewable generation projects, which require significant investment in development before plants can be built and where many projects do not prove viable. The country also needs investment in transmission, but this is more complicated because the provision of electricity transmission is constitutionally reserved to the state. Yet, the government can subcontract the construction and financing of transmission projects, and private companies can build transmission when related to their own generation. New models of public-private coordination are needed to evaluate projects, source financing, and develop the infrastructure in the electricity transmission sector. Bravos was founded in order to reduce the barriers to private participation in the Mexican power sector, both by providing operational services that facilitate diverse companies' activities in the Mexican wholesale electricity market, and to support the negotiation of bilateral contracts that investors need prior to committing to build new infrastructure.</p><p><strong>In what kind of energy services does Bravos Energia specialize?<br></strong>Bravos Energia began operations in May of 2017. We have occasionally been misidentified as a consulting firm, but in fact we have provided two specific services since the beginning. One is to help generation asset owners operate their power plants and load centers in the wholesale electricity market. A great deal of daily coordination is required to sell or buy power in the market. Bravos Energia performs all the daily administrative tasks for generators and qualified retailers and pure power marketers; currently, we have around 15 customers for these services. Numerous private companies have built plants in Mexico but cannot efficiently undertake these tasks themselves, which would represent a barrier to entry into the market if our services weren't available. Both investors seeking to evaluate opportunities and market participants considering long-term contracts need reliable and detailed forecasts of future prices. This is not an easy task, as much of the information on the power system is difficult to process and apply. We have dedicated a large amount of time to corroborating and improving the publicly available sources and constructing a detailed simulation model of the power system, in order to provide quality forecasts.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us about the first private auction for electricity that Bravos Energia is currently structuring?<br></strong>Private auctions are Bravos' newest activity and probably the most interesting. We have always been looking for ways to leverage the experience gained through our general operations in order to add more value in the industry. That opportunity came up as many of our customers and potential customers had approached us seeking help finding or negotiating long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) contracts. Generation developers need PPAs to finance their investments, but the administrative and salesforce costs of obtaining such contracts are prohibitively high for many developers. At the same time, many large consumers were frustrated by the difficulty of comparing different offers and the complexity of obtaining contracts with a diversified mix of wind, solar, and gas resources. These companies, both buyers and sellers, wanted us to seek out different counterparties for them. We eventually achieved a critical mass of both consumers who wanted help in finding a competitive electricity supply, and generators seeking a PPA and realized we could hold a general auction for the entire industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the factors behind your decision to remain bullish with your investments during uncertain market times?<br></strong>IEnova has been investing in Mexico for over 20 years, so we have a long-term view in Mexico. The nature of our business, projects, and business model is long term. We have a sustainable and resilient business model that has allowed us to grow the company over the past 20 years, and that is the reason why we will continue looking into the future for the next 10, 20, and 30 years. We develop energy infrastructure projects for Mexico that are relevant for the country's energy supply. What we do is important to Mexico in the long run; we build gas pipelines that allow gas supply to industrial and power generation, primarily to the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). We build power generation that allows industrial consumers to buy energy that is not only clean but also cost effective. We distribute gas to over 130,000 households in Mexico and have lately been entering the refined products storage market. The fundamentals for business have been in place for the past 20 years and are still in place, and our investments continue to be important for Mexico in the long run. Mexico is going through a difficult situation, though investments are even more important to overcome these difficult times. Countries need electricity and natural gas; homes, businesses, hospitals, and industry need electricity and natural gas to continue to operate, create jobs, and be able to pay competitive salaries. Electricity, gas supply, and energy supply are critical to the economy because a country cannot function without an efficient energy supply. That is what we do, and that is what we have been doing in Mexico for over 20 years: guaranteeing an efficient energy supply to our country.</p><p><strong>What is needed to be able to achieve energy security?<br></strong>Energy security means ensuring an efficient supply of energy to all Mexicans. Efficient means it is clean, timely, and affordable. Energy security entails having the required infrastructure to ensure energy supply to all Mexicans. In order to achieve that, a combination between government and private investment is needed. The government has a critical role to play, first in determining the countries' energy policy, designing the specific regulations that are required for an efficient energy market to function and for energy infrastructure to be developed. In addition to the state productive companies, Pemex, and CFE, the private sector also has an important role to play in developing infrastructure and markets. I see both efforts as being complementary.</p><p><strong>What main advancements are you planning for your Costa Azul export facility in 2020?<br></strong>The Energí­a Costa Azul project is an existing regasification facility that we want to convert into a liquefied natural gas facility (LNG) to supply isolated markets in Mexico and other international markets. We have been working for several years now in this project and are in the final stretch to be able to achieve a final investment decision. We need to get across the finish line to finalize the contracts with our customers, and that should be close now. We are waiting to receive one final approval for a gas export permit from the Ministry of Energy (SENER). Once those things happen, we will be able to take the final investment decision in 2Q2020. The investment into the LNG facility plus an associated gas pipeline will be around USD1.9 billion.</p><p><strong>What factors do you expect will create a boost in energy demand in the coming years?<br></strong>Mexico has a growing population and middle class, as well as an active and growing industry that is exporting and requires efficient energy supply. Regardless of the short-term economic prospects of Mexico, many of the fundamentals for growing energy demand will be there. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does this department play on the company's overall business strategy?<br></strong>We are committed to lowering the cost of energy for the whole company. We are one of the largest energy consumers in Mexico, as we use electricity as the main energy source for steel production. We are in charge of procuring power and gas to more than 24 facilities around the country, both for steel factories and other facilities as well. We also produce steel from recycled materials and are completely integrated. Deacero has had the power department for seven years, and we make sure the company has the electricity it needs. When I joined the company in 2019, I noticed there were many opportunities to go beyond by leveraging all the opportunities provided by the energy reform. Deacero has the power, scale, and balance sheet to become an important market participant in the Mexican electric wholesale market. After deciding to head in that direction, in September 2019 we signed a contract with the National Energy Control Center (CENACE) to become a formal market participant. So far, we are the only industrial company in Mexico to have taken that decision. The energy consumption of the company is large enough to justify the investment. We signed a bulk power agreement (BPA) with private companies in Mexico to make sure we have enough energy for our operations, and in May we will formally begin operations as a market participant, with a 165-MW BPA with CENACE.</p><p><strong>How does this save costs for the company?<br></strong>We are looking at two main things: cost and reliability of the service. The second one is provided by the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) through its transmission infrastructure. With all these contracts we are entering into, we have secured energy that is 30% lower than what we have paid before. For steel companies such as Deacero, power represents 30% of its transformation costs in steel products, which can determine the profitability of production.</p><p><strong>How much did the company invest in this transition to become a market participant?<br></strong>The main investment is preparing the infrastructure, building up the system, and hiring the right people. It is significant, though the main investment comes when you have to execute the contract of around a 15-year commitment. We will be customers only at the beginning. We will partner with an international company to eventually build a combined cycle powered by natural gas infrastructure in Guanajuato. We will do that with Fisterra, an affiliate for Blackstone. We are in the process of acquiring the permits and expect to have the COD in January 2023. We are just investors for this project; we are not operators. We are keen to diversify our energy sources to be able to have alternatives if the event the grid fails at any point. We want to increase our renewable energy mix in our portfolio, but given the nature of our business, we cannot at this time rely only on renewable energy due to the continuity we need; however, we are starting to take steps in that direction. We are offtakers of a 110-MW solar plant in the north of Sonora for our consumption. We want to be sure we comply with all the regulations on renewables, and the more we can move to a higher use of renewables, the better, though we need to do it in a smart way.</p><p><strong>What does the model need to motivate more companies to follow your example?<br></strong>They need the information, because not everyone knows about it. This comes from the Electric Industry Law enacted in 2014. The companies wanted better alternatives without carrying any risks; however, we are now absolutely confident in the market and all the regulation around it. The second thing is to have the scale of consumption, and the third is to be committed to having all the tools needed to operate it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the greatest recent advancements in the Mexican energy sector?<br></strong>There have been little advancements. Unfortunately, there is still confusion and uncertainty over the role the government would like the private sector to play as part of its energy policy. The only thing that is clear so far is that the government wants to strengthen the state-owned companies, Pemex and CFE. Besides that, there have been contradictory messages in terms of where the private sector would be welcome. A necessary condition for any kind of advancement is that the government has to be clear on this regard.</p><p><strong>What role does the government want the private sector to have?<br></strong>In general terms, it seems to me that it is a marginal role, a complement to what Pemex and CFE cannot—or do not want to—do. However, the current economic crisis will probably put great pressure on the government, up to the point it recognizes it will not be possible to have a vibrant and dynamic sector with CFE and Pemex alone, more so now that it is more difficult for it to obtain funds and given its limited budget. On the contrary, there is a private sector that, although suffering from the economic crisis, has other resources that the government does not. I hope there will be a change and a different message from the government, inviting the private sector to invest in the industry.</p><p><strong>Will one of the positive things of these developments be the government looking to the private sector for production in the industry?</strong><br>That should definitely happen as there are no options. This crisis has some implications in terms of fiscal policy, and the government will have to use its resources to attend to the crisis and help small businesses that have been and will be affected. All these resources will have to be redirected to these activities and issues, and the government may have to reduce taxes or give tax rebates. That means there will be a smaller budget and less resources for CFE and Pemex. If the government does not have those sources, the only source is the private sector. Reality will sink in, and the government will have to be more pragmatic. The announcement to be made by the government—which has been delayed—on investments in the energy sector done by the private sector will be even more relevant. That should be a signal that the government is really changing its thoughts on how to interact in this industry.</p><p><strong>What should Pemex do in terms of its existing debt to emerge from its current financial crisis?<br></strong>Pemex will have to redirect its small amount of resources, as one of our problems is that the budget is in pesos. With the depreciation of the peso, Pemex will have fewer resources to invest, and it has to focus on those activities with the highest returns, like the production of oil in shallow water or fields where the cost of extraction is low, instead of investing in new projects where the cost of production is higher. The government should redirect resources for the new refinery to other activities that are more profitable. Pemex should go with farm outs wherever it can in order to develop the resources without having to compromise its budget. That is definitely another option that will have to be evaluated by the government in the short term.</p><p><strong>How do you help your clients prepare for possible emerging opportunities?<br></strong>We do several things, but under the current circumstances we start by helping them navigate the adverse environment of changes in regulations. At the same time, we have identified opportunities that remain available independently of the circumstances both in the electricity and hydrocarbons sectors. It is those areas in which we are focusing our efforts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main trends in Mexico when it comes to co-working spaces, and how do you predict demand in this space to change in the coming years?</strong><br>Coworking spaces have been the subject of some hype over recent years, but this is not a new business. I have been in this business for over 20 years, and this industry has been around for almost 40. The concept started in San Francisco, and it has been evolving and changing ever since. There are many new things going on, new companies, and many new styles, but at the end of the day people need to work. Part of the time, they need to concentrate and focus on whatever they are doing, and at other times, they can be productive if they work in open spaces where they interact with other people and get new ideas or fresh perspectives. IOS OFFICES is sticking to its core in delivering to our clients the different scenarios we all experience in a normal business day. We do many other things too. For example, we have a bar with free coffee and alcohol; it is only for members. If you need a distraction, you can stop working for a while without leaving your workplace. We try to change the ambiance, for example, by offering dining rooms. We also organize over 3,000 different events every year. Our main event is the annual IOS Network Summit that takes place mid-year, where we invite business leaders to share their story of success. We gather around 1,500 of our community members in Mexico City for a full day of networking.</p><p><strong>How would you evaluate the overall performance of IOS OFFICES in 2019, and how did it compare to 2018?<br></strong>IOS OFFICES had one of its best years in 2019 in a number of ways. We had record-high occupancy levels and our net promoter score was around 95%, which means our clients are happy. I co-founded IOS OFFICES in 2007 with my brother Adrián. It has been a long road, but we are finally growing at a steady pace. The market recognizes us as the leader in Mexico for co-working spaces. Our footprint is the largest in the country, with presence in 12 cities and 36 locations. Our clients are entrepreneurs, professionals, and large companies looking for a solution where they can work and be productive and happy at the same time. In 2020, we are adding a center in Culiacán, León, and Guadalajara and a few more in Mexico City, along with some others under negotiation.</p><p><strong>What strategies do you use to identify the next locations for your centers?<br></strong>We look for integral business hubs or mixed-use spaces where our clients can experience an extraordinary environment every day at work. For example, at our location in Miyana, there are movie theaters, restaurants, three apartment buildings, and one office building. We are in the heart of Polanco, surrounded by hotels. We have established our brand in such a way that building owners and developers look for us. IOS OFFICES evaluates over 200 proposals each year, and we pick the best ones. We are mainly in spaces that are leased, but we do own some real estate. It depends on the city.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals for 2020?<br></strong>We are a goal-oriented kind of company. When we established IOS OFFICES, we set out an ambitious business plan along with short-term goals. In general, we follow a combination of long and short-term goals. As we accomplish a goal, another long-term goal becomes our short-term focus, so you could say we have a chain of goals. For 2020, we are opening more centers in a few more cities. One short-term goal is to open IOS outside of Mexico. We are always working on our company culture and product concept. In early 2020, we will open in León and Culiacán and perhaps in one more location outside of Mexico. Yes, we are going global. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What would be the benefits of diversifying the economy and strengthening logistics and sea freight industries?<br></strong>Today, we have an inverse relation with our coasts, relative to other countries, with most of our economic production being inland and only about 20% alongside our 11,000km of coastlines and 117 sea ports. Our ultimate objective is to reverse this. We are developing an investment platform and roadmap completely independent from public funding. Mexico needs to ensure sustainable and reliable investment in the industry over time that is unrelated to government changes. To secure optimal operations and high productivity alongside the supply chain in many industries, every stakeholder in the process needs to be involved in improving the sector. As of 2019, there are 800 world-class companies currently operating that have invested over MXN150 billion, representing 80% of the overall investment into ports in Mexico. The sector has grown steadily around 4-5% on a yearly basis and has continually attracted the largest companies that want to seize on Mexico's special location.</p><p><strong>Why is CGPMM prioritizing the Veracruz Port, Progreso Port, and the expansion of the Cuyutlán Lagoon as its key projects?<br></strong>They are the ones with most potential to influence reliability on inland transportation. The costs for land freight continue to increase, and the operational risks are extremely high. In 2019, the government invested over MXN20 billion in only maintaining current roads, and security issues are ongoing. We need to develop infrastructure that would serve as viable alternatives or primary ways of moving cargo in, out, and within the Mexican territory. We are working alongside main inland operators to create “sea roads" or routes that would serve as main replacements for today's most troublesome inland routes. We recently signed an agreement with the Private Haulers Association, of which companies like FEMSA and Walmart are members, to jointly develop these projects. The operators will see massive savings in reduction of robberies, maintenance to their units, size, and gas that will, in turn, be translated into setting reasonable fares for sea freight. Under this agreement, we will integrate every stakeholder, unify cargo for efficiency, and prepare logistics for the mixed sea-land routes. All but two of our ports were conceived for commercial use rather than industrial. We needed to select three ports of major significance that were completely maxed out so that our investment would make the highest-possible impact. </p><p><strong>How are you expecting the introduction of privately-operated ports to influence the industry?<br></strong>We have transformed and brought together 16 individual regional ports into an integrated intermodal coastal ports system. The idea is to combine cargo efforts under one route that would unify international cargo and allow a single port to carry out exports to main global markets directly, rather than consolidating cargo in different ports, with cargo even going to the US before it is shipped to Asia alongside other cargo. We can increase the output of a single port hundredfold to attract main shipping lines to create direct routes to and from our single point of consolidation in Mexico. Our plan is to strengthen the infrastructure in such a way that would encourage the private sector to carry out new projects, invest in new businesses, or grow existing ones, thus generating a self-sustaining sector in which private investment is not only welcome but also necessary for the industry's survival. We also want to attract regional investment by getting communities, local companies, or regionally based companies to participate in projects enabled by us through foundations. For example, in the Altamira Port, we invested MXN400 million in dredging the port and incentivizing improved FERROMEX logistic services. This effort is to then going to enable Ternium, a steel manufacturer, to invest around USD25 billion in opening its industrial activity, giving them easier access to its raw materials imported from Brazil through Altamira. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>This corridor will represent 1.6% of the country's GDP after it is built. How is the project going to achieve that?<br></strong>This is an ambitious project that will trigger the development of Mexico's south and southeast. Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador's government wants to develop the south to equalize development throughout the country. The south is rich in natural resources but has been abandoned by the federal governments for many years. The refinery in Dos Bocas, the Maya train, and this corridor are the three big projects to develop the area. We want to seize the strategic location of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to develop the region. We have located land where we can launch a bidding process to create development parks, with some tax incentives to be granted to developers. Right now, the commercial rivalry between the US and China could help us attract investment, as there are many companies seeking locations outside of China because of the import tariffs that the US government has imposed. In our view, Mexico has excellent connectivity. We are just two sailing days away from the US' East Coast, and we are closer to China than the Panama Canal. This position can bring opportunities to create a new maritime route for trade, such as a trade route between China and the US' eastern seaboard. Our plan is to modernize the logistics infrastructure to attract companies to come and invest in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. We will connect all the infrastructure built with the Maya Train to the new Dos Bocas refinery in Tabasco. It will be also connected with the Guatemalan border because the old railway tracks there are abandoned and cannot be used. Therefore, the government's plan is to refurbish much of that infrastructure to develop the logistics sector. We also see the potential for companies that want to establish themselves in the energy sector here. It is important to note the good quality of work that the people from Oaxaca and Veracruz offer. Here, there are natural resources and experienced workers; all we need is to unite the two ports via rail in order to connect the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts. </p><p><strong>What investment will this project require?<br></strong>Without taking into account the investment that in the development parks, we project that the investment of the public sector will amount to MXN100 billion over six years. In terms of infrastructure, the public sector will invest MXN150 billion to develop oil pipelines in the corridor. Meanwhile, in the parks, we expect a MXN50-billion investment.</p><p><strong>When do you expect the project to be complete?<br></strong>In 2020, we must refurbish and modernize the rail and port infrastructure. We have signed contracts for ports and trains already. For the Port of Salina Cruz, we have modernized a pier, and we want to refurbish another one. In 2021, we can start operations in that port and handle a high number of containers. We are in the process of launching bidding processes for some of the projects, but the pandemic has delayed some of them. Currently, we are designing a bidding process for the management of a terminal of containers, among the other tenders we have. As for Coatzacoalcos, we are modernizing some ports and refurbishing an area so it can be used to store containers. This area would only be a temporary container terminal, because we will develop a container terminal in Coatzacoalcos and another in Salina Cruz within the next three years. We will be able to start transporting containers port to port in 2021. In addition to the logistics infrastructure, we will implement a comprehensive development plan for the region. We are specifically designing a program for the development of all municipalities in the isthmus, especially their local economies. We want to support the agriculture sector in this area so residents no longer need to immigrate to the US. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Air France strengthening its market share of the air traffic between Cancún and Paris?<br></strong>With direct flights between the two destinations, Air France controls a large part of that market. We made the decision to increase the number of weekly flights from three to five in November 2019, and we will soon operate one daily flight. This route represents a leisure market for us as Europeans prefer traveling to Cancún to further explore southern Mexico rather than only staying in a resort in Cancún. We will continue to invest in Cancún in the coming years. Demand is high for daily flights during winter due to the cold weather in Europe. Between November and March, many Europeans are looking for holiday destinations that have good weather and plenty of sun, and Cancún fits perfectly in this category. We have plans to further connect Mexico with Europe. The Cancún airport is one of the best in Mexico and Latin America. We also operate an Air France daily flight from Paris to Mexico City. Notably, 20% of the passengers flying to Mexico with us connect to other destinations.</p><p><strong>How does Air France-KLM plan to collaborate with the new administration to fulfill its vision for the aviation industry?<br></strong>First, we have always had a good business relationship with the Mexican authorities. Mexico is a popular destination. We are operating the A380 plane in Mexico, which is quite challenging due to its size and the equipment needed to handle it. This is an example of the good working relationship that we have with the authorities, especially the airport authorities. It is critical to make sure the country can develop, and people can travel for business or pleasure. We have a close relationship with all the stakeholders and are open to sharing our views on what we think will make sense for the future.</p><p><strong>What strategies is Air France-KLM using to maintain its competitive edge? <br></strong>We are in Mexico with joint ventures through Alitalia and Delta. It is a strategic organization between the North Atlantic and Europe. We represent 30% of flights between Europe and Mexico and have been the market leaders for five years in a row. Our strong position is based on a good product; we operate flights from Amsterdam, Paris, and Rome. In terms of customer experience and service we have one of the best products you can find in Mexico. We are above 50 in terms of NPS in Mexico. On top of that, we have a strong identity; KLM celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2019 and became the first airline in the world to do so without changing its original name. Air France and KLM are airlines with histories and identities. For example, Air France is the only airline that offers champagne in all of its cabins. When you travel with Air France, you taste France. </p><p><strong>What do you think differentiates the market in Mexico in comparison to other Latin American markets?<br></strong>Cuba, for example, is special; it is a leisure market with great potential and Air France-KLM is already operating flights to Cuba. Brazil and Mexico are quite similar in terms of market characteristics, but Brazil has a broader market due to the size of the country. There is a huge business and corporate potential as well as big leisure potential in both countries. There is intense competition between airlines in these two countries. All major European airlines are operating in these countries and by the end of the year the competition will grow stronger with the entrance of Turkish Airlines and Emirates. Therefore, the company needs to offer the best product to maintain its leading position. We are investing heavily in Mexico in terms of customer experience. For example, we worked with a top local chef to design meals for the KLM business menu. Similarly, we will soon announce a similar initiative with a local chef for Air France. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the current perception of security in Mexico?<br></strong>Security is a relevant topic worldwide and in Mexico. The overall environment is getting more challenging and there are many reasons for this, the biggest reason being the need for virtual and digital security on top of traditional physical security. This creates a challenging environment. There are 8,000 private security companies in Mexico, of which 70% are clandestine. Of the remaining 30%, some 60% are informal. They are real companies but do not necessarily provide all the training and worker benefits necessary to maintain a strong, standard business. The notion that we need to professionalize the private security space is key, and the country is gradually moving toward this.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the company?<br></strong>Worldwide, Prosegur's revenues are a little over EUR4 billion per year, and we have over 160,000 employees. The company is a combination of three companies that offer a 360-degree security solution that is based on innovation and technology: Prosegur Cash, which offers cash-in-transit services; Prosegur Alarms, which has a broad range of end-to-end security solutions for homes and small businesses; and Prosegur Security. Essentially, we approach companies and governments and offer security in the shape of solutions that combine people, technology, and services. We design, implement, and operate the solution. We are system integrators; therefore, we bring technologies from different companies, and we take sole responsibility for the whole solution. I run ProSegur Security for North Latam. Today, for example, some large companies have a fairly rudimentary understanding of their security needs. Companies often contract out separate security needs, and there is no holistic or coherent strategy. We offer holistic analysis and consulting solutions that involve an in-depth analysis of how companies manage risk and leverage technology, people, processes, best practices, and so on. We put everything together and then provide a set of recommendations that include this end-to-end perspective. We design, implement, and operate these processes, and we offer these services with three-, four-, or five-year contracts. We seek to provide more value to our customers and higher-quality service at a reduced cost. In many ways, we become a trusted advisor and confidant of our customers. This is the level of trust that we aspire to build.</p><p><strong>What have been some of your key projects in Mexico and what sectors do you currently target in the country?<br></strong>At present, there are 20,000 employees working in Peru, Colombia, and Mexico. We have around 9,000 employees in Peru, 8,000 in Colombia, and 2,000 in Mexico. We started from scratch in Mexico and have been pursuing an organic growth strategy. In many countries, Prosegur acquires an existing company, which is what we did in Colombia and Peru. The Mexican market has the potential to be three times bigger. Based on the potential in Mexico, we are focusing on large multinational companies that are both headquartered in Mexico and abroad. We are not focusing on the public sector because there are better opportunities in the private sector. However, that does not mean we will not focus on the public sector in the future. We have been successful in the automotive, manufacturing, and finance sectors. Rather than selling discrete products, we are focused on selling complete solutions. The Mexican market is not used to seeing a security company offer such wide-ranging and integrated solutions, which is a key advantage for us. We are focused on providing people, technology, and processes. If you only focus on one component of that mixture, you cannot provide the most effective and holistic solution. We are the only company in Mexico that has the capability to provide complete solutions. Clients often assume our solutions will be fairly expensive, though in reality they are not as expensive as having a dozen different contractors providing different services. In 2019, we acquired four technology companies in the US, and we have now integrated them into the corporate structure. We acquired a cybersecurity firm, a guarding services firm, an electronic security systems company, and a video security company. I participated in a meeting in Spain not too long ago, and we talked a great deal about AI, big data, machine learning, and automation. We know where we want to go, and we are pivoting in that direction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What factors motivated you to open a country club in Hidalgo?<br></strong>Golf is a special sport in Mexico. There are no public golf courses in the country except for those in tourist areas in Puerto Los Cabos, Cancún. Inside Mexico City, and the rest of the country, we only have private clubs. In the US, there are about 26,000 golf courses, while in Mexico, we have around 300. Similarly, in the US, there are about 40 million golfers. In Mexico, we have about 300,000 golfers. We saw this opportunity and decided to open Amanali Country Club &amp; Náutica. We also have a lake, so I usually call Amanali the new Valle del Bravo. Our market is basically Mexico City. Around 70% of our customers are from Mexico City, and we are only one hour away from it. At present, we have about 240 homes and eventually we will have 2,000 homes. We do not sell shares of our club but we offer memberships. So far, we have 400 memberships. Our maximum capacity is 700. Eventually, we will have space for 1,500 members. People started building houses here about five years ago, and we are currently building another 200 homes. We only use Mexican contemporary style in order to keep the same design throughout the golf course. A yearly membership costs USD12,000.</p><p><strong>When will the second phase of the country club be completed?<br></strong>We just started working on phase two. During the first one, we sold 1,000 lots in seven years. In the beginning, 1sqm cost USD75 and now it is around USD350. A house in Amanali costs USD500,000, and the annual maintenance fee is about USD40,000. This is of course a long-term investment. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about UNOPS' commercial strategy and activities in Latin America and Mexico?<br></strong>We are the UN's special projects services unit, and we work under the umbrella and sponsorship of the UN General Assembly. An important distinction to other institutions within the UN system is that we do not receive any funding from UN member countries and our operations are entirely financed by our own projects, effectively running as if we were a private-sector company. Yet, we are not a for-profit organization and our main goal is to support mainly public institutions that are undertaking important infrastructure projects to contribute significantly to advancing a country or region's development agenda. We provide funding and technical assistance to the institutions we work with.</p><p><strong>What are some of your main projects in Mexico?<br></strong>We started operations in Mexico in March 2019 and, since then, we have been working closely with the central government. We have supported many transport-related projects with different levels of success. For example, we achieved a 38% cost reduction for the cable bus project and helped with the acquisitions of many transportation units, such as buses and wagons, for a lower cost than originally planned. Our main approach to business has been bringing public and private enterprises closer and increasing cooperation through instruments such as PPPs or concessions. At present, we are promoting the Mayan train renovations and new works on Mexico's federal district's subway. We are also collaborating with the foreign ministry's equipment to boost the security standards of Mexican documentation, such as passports.</p><p><strong>How are you working with the government to create and improve the investment landscape in public projects?<br></strong>In our experience, we have witnessed interest from the private sector and the international investment community to participate in all tenders. Just recently, we oversaw the public tenders for some segments of the railroad projects. The government has shown sincere interest in fighting corruption and, in our projects, we've been able to turn this interest into reality by considerably reducing costs and delays in projects that existed before due to bureaucracy and shady detours the projects sometimes took.</p><p><strong>What are the main differences between the special business and policy dynamics in Mexico compared to other countries in Latin America?</strong><br>The main difference is navigating the federal landscape and accounting for the different and sometimes opposite policy directions and objectives of the central and state governments. Adding to this, the fact that there are two separate systems and processes for tendering for publics works and for acquiring goods and services results in a complicated legal framework. There are currently some reforms planned for this, and a big lesson to learn from regional partners is to create a simple, transparent, and fair system for designing, tendering, and executing big projects. These reforms need to come along a strict and enforceable set of countercorruption measures with clear consequences for non-compliant parties. We have seen double-digit cost reduction in every policy reinforcement process we have worked on all over the region, and we are confident that the ability to adopt these practices are key for projects in Mexico. The economic aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic can only be resolved through job creation, which in turn is a consequence of investment.</p><p><strong>What are UNOPS' main priorities for the rest of 2020?<br></strong>We have two main goals for the rest of 2020 and 2021, which are obviously related to the COVID-19 crisis. On the first stage, we need to support Mexico and the rest of the region in enduring the economic implications of the lockdown and rupture of the global industrial supply chain. Then, we need to work on economic reactivation through promotion of investment opportunities that will lead to job creation and economic stimulation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been FICADE's main accomplishments since 2018?<br></strong>Overall, 2019 was a complicated and atypical year in terms of permits because the government was reviewing a number of projects that had already started, and new projects took longer than usual to be approved. This caused new projects and businesses that were in the pipeline to be delayed. We have a few important projects already approved, but it was difficult to launch new projects, and that prompted us to be cautious in terms of buying new land. We are waiting for the housing policy to be completely clear. The Mayor of Mexico City included a stipulation in the regulations that requires one to have low-cost housing in certain locations; however, the execution of these policies is still not clear. Due to the changes in government, we are waiting to see where we are headed with the new regulations.</p><p><strong>What type of land are you planning to buy and what projects will you launch?<br></strong>Since we want to enter the low-cost housing segment, we are looking to buy land for less than MXN2.5 million. We want to make housing as low cost as possible for the final buyer. The foundation of the industry is solid, and it is independent of the government in office. There are always opportunities, and with hard work one can achieve results. We are looking for land where there are no restrictions on the minimum size for housing because that way we can build small apartments in central locations that are both profitable for and affordable for buyers. Housing that costs over MXN6-7 million is slow on the uptake, and the lower market is more dynamic. We are exploring some options for renting, but it is more difficult to mix products because buying a shared house is difficult. Co-living models work better for rentals because they are temporary. Some digital platforms are starting their operations in Mexico, and we are building partnerships with foreign companies that are dedicated to short- or long-term rentals. We are about to launch a co-living project in Condesa. Our core will always be selling housing, but we are also looking into these new lines of business.</p><p><strong>What types of financing do you use to develop new projects?<br></strong>We use private investors to buy the land and banks for building, specifically bridge loans. These loans are established so that when you sell a unit you pay a part of the loan. For co-living, the model is different and more long term, but banks give those types of loans as well. There is uncertainty right now, but there will be new opportunities in the future. We need to be prepared for pandemics because this is not the first or the last. In today's world, more people have the privilege of being in a lockdown at home with their needs covered; however, many others are not as fortunate and live day by day. More sources of funding will be created due to this crisis, but I cannot anticipate what they would look like. There will be economic reactivation plans, where interest rates will go down, and loan payments could be postponed. There is a great deal of panic right now, but once the situation calms down, people's attitudes will also make a huge difference. We are giving assurances to our staff, and we are supporting them. We would reduce salaries before firing anyone.</p><p><strong>What will be your main priorities for the rest of 2020?<br></strong>We want to launch two new projects as soon as the crisis is over. The other priority is to structure the new co-living model and rentals, because there is an interesting and important opportunity in that segment. We will wait to see what happens after the pandemic, because it is an unprecedented crisis in the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was Fibra Uno's biggest achievement in 2019?<br></strong>Our biggest achievement was definitely our participation in capital markets. We issued over USD1 million in bonds that, given the conditions of the market, allowed us to strengthen our financial position. It will play a significant role in our acquisition of a 1.2-million-sqm estate portfolio that we call the Titan market. This is prime estate close to the US-Mexico border and it currently serves industrial manufacturing with high export potential.</p><p><strong>What is Fibra Uno's decision-making process when investing in a new project?<br></strong>It goes beyond any particular set process; it is based on the instinct we have developed over years of experience. In addition, because we are the largest real estate group in Mexico, virtually every opportunity crosses our desks. We have a great understanding of the current state of the market. All the 600 acquisitions that we have done over the last nine years went through strict screening and due diligence.</p><p><strong>What is Fibra Uno's competitive advantage over other real estate firms in Mexico?<br></strong>We represent 45% of the national market, and the liquidity behind our bonds is extraordinary. Those conditions ensure great stability in our finances and grants us access to international markets and investment, which is something that most other firms lack. We have built a diverse portfolio that includes industrial, corporate, and commercial properties. For many, this allows us to be their one-stop shop for real estate.</p><p><strong>How has Fibra Uno adapted to modern trends of e-commerce and shared workspaces?<br></strong>Our ideal share has always been 40% commercial estate, 40% industrial, and 20% office space. Over the years and as promising opportunities came up, the proportion shifted in different directions. With the recent acquisition of industrial properties, that share will go back, more or less, to our ideal ratio for risk management reasons.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the COVID-19 crisis to impact your market and the economy?<br></strong>Beyond COVID-19, the overall conditions of the market are also affected by the plummeting oil prices and will present a complex picture. We will support our tenants in every way possible and have already accounted for not receiving a regular year's worth of rents and payments in some of our properties. Thankfully, our company has a strong financial backing, allowing us to withstand the effects of the pandemic, pivot into good opportunities that may arise, and support our people.</p><p><strong>Most of our interviewees say Mexico lacks investment in real estate. What is your take on the matter?<br></strong>Depending on where one is looking, the current conditions will generate the best real estate investment opportunities the market has ever seen. Specifically, on built projects, the market will offer great deals in the next 12-18 months. New real estate might have to wait a few years because construction will slow down. On our side, we will finish our ongoing projects and then wait for great opportunities to reach our desks.</p><p><strong>Can you expand on Fibra Uno's ongoing projects?<br></strong>We are developing the biggest mixed-use project in Mexico. The first office building is up and running, the commercial mall will open in 2021, and the 72-story Mí­tikah residential tower will be complete in early 2021. On the industrial side, we are developing over 360,000sqm of logistics and supply chain facilities. For example, we recently finished TecnoParque.</p><p><strong>What are your main priorities for 2020?<br></strong>Stability is our main priority for 2020. We will work to ensure job security for our staff so that they can face the current crisis without losing any income. We will also do our best to support our tenants and be ready to jump on any promising opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the pandemic affecting the real estate sector in Mexico?<br></strong>The majority of companies in the housing sector construct small projects and do not have access to finance. As the largest financial institution operating in the real estate sector in Latin America, we like working with highly innovative companies. The pandemic has created two main problems. First, since people are in lockdown, those who are interested in looking for a house are not able to do so. That generates a demand problem. As a result, a number of construction projects have been put on hold. If we can reactivate the economy by June, it is possible to balance supply and demand again. We are trying to process mortgage loans despite the pandemic. We are open to mortgage requests. Our focus during the health emergency is showing the other face of Infonavit. We provide seven out of 10 loans in Mexico, and we protect private workers. For example, we are offering a three-month moratorium to clients whose salaries took a hit. In addition, we have deferred some mandatory payments that companies have to make to Infonavit. By the end of May, and especially in June and July, we expect the real estate sector to soar, and people will start to seek new loans.</p><p><strong>What factors will help the sector to recover in June?<br></strong>People have to return to their jobs because that is the only way to boost consumption. Infonavit is linked to the working cycle. Our service is for people working in the formal sector, so we cannot help those workers who get paid under the table.</p><p><strong>How are you adjusting your 2020 targets?<br></strong>We have not adjusted our goals. Our goal was to award 500,000 loans, and we expect to achieve that because we are launching new financial services. We think that a lot of people will need cash to acquire houses, which is why we are increasing our cash flow to award mortgage loans. We have a product that can help people refurbish their homes. We are also planning to launch a new financing line in August. In Guanajuato or Michoacán, some families own large plots of land, and we can help them develop their land through our loans. Our new financial services will diversify our portfolio. That is why we are maintaining the same goal, but we are reviewing the distribution of our portfolio.</p><p><strong>How do you seek to unite loans from different individuals to finance common projects?<br></strong>In February 2020, we launched a product named Let's Unite Credits, which allows us to unite different loans from different people. With this new product, couples, friends, or relatives can unite their loans to then acquire a larger house. In addition, there are cases in which unmarried couples who live together cannot acquire loans. We are trying to cater to such clients through our products. In Mexico, rules for the construction sector vary from municipality to municipality. As a result, some cities still have outdated laws. Municipalities should cut red tape and make the entire process more flexible.</p><p><strong>What can be done to make the process more flexible?<br></strong>The government established the Secretariat of Agrarian, Territorial, and Urban Development in 2013 for this purpose. We are helping the government implement the National Housing Program. We have been able to start conversations with municipalities, but there are 2,500 municipalities in Mexico, which means that there are 2,500 different construction regulations.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>One goal is to award 3 million mortgage loans to solve the existing housing deficit. We need to provide access to new homes for individuals. We have 5.5 million clients, and last year we awarded around a million credits. Some of them are old credits, which were awarded under disadvantageous conditions for the families. We have to provide loans that are adjusted to the reality of Mexican society and that are sustainable in the long term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In what ways has Marzam diversified its business portfolio?<br></strong>Our business is primarily focused on the private sector, where 96% of our sales come from. We have defined our business in different strategic pillars so we have a key component, namely independent pharmacies, as well as regional pharmacies, national pharmacy chains, supermarkets, private hospitals, and the public sector, which represents 4% of our business. Each pillar has its own unique strategy, and they are completely different businesses with unique functions and requirements. One of the key things we did in the last three years was to implement specific specialized teams for each of these businesses, and implementation has been excellent. In the past, Marzam was focused on pure prescription products, though today we have a unique portfolio of prescription, consumer, specialized, and controlled products and have diversified further into generics and specialized products, which have been our main growth areas in the last 12-18 months. We have 10 distribution centers in the country, and the product portfolios in each of those distribution centers can be extremely different. We have sought to adapt our offerings based on regional requirements.</p><p><strong>What trends in the market are health product distributors focusing more on?<br></strong>Marzam is heavily focused on prescription medication. We are experiencing significant growth in consumer products that do not require prescriptions and enormous growth in generics. Mexico is the number-one consumer of generics in the world; 83% of the volume consumed in Mexico is generic. Previously, distributors like Marzam did not focus on generics, though today they are a core part of our business whereby we are growing our presence, sales, and team in generics. The same goes for consumer products. We have a unique strategy for private hospitals. Typically, companies focus on top-tier hospitals, though there is a massive area of opportunity in the middle and lower segments, which are underserved. Another area that we have been growing our presence in the last 12-18 months is specialty products.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about your USD6-million investment in fleet and a distribution center?<br></strong>From an investment perspective, we are always challenging ourselves on what we need to improve. The healthcare distribution sector has low margins, around low single digits. Our investment is heavily focused on building efficiencies for our business as top-line margin growth will not grow much more. In the last four years, we have renovated 100% of our distribution fleet. We have also invested a significant amount in technology and are currently experiencing a big transformational change around SAP. All this is a large upfront commitment in terms of investment, though we expect this to translate into efficiencies in our business and way of working going forward. Our goal is to ensure that we are making the right strategic choices for our business not only for today but the next five to 10 years.</p><p><strong>What strategies has the company used to mitigate the security risks in Mexico?<br></strong>It is definitely a challenge, and we continuously look at the different alternatives from a security perspective. We distribute to approximately 27,000 pharmacies in the country every two days, which is a significant commitment and requires a lot of infrastructure. Security is an issue; however, we have been able to overcome many of these challenges by implementing technology as well as having a greater level of interaction with the local, regional, and federal authorities.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the company?<br></strong>Our intention is not to invest in pharmacies but to provide a better service to our customers. We are continuously adapting and ensuring that our infrastructure is one step ahead, and we adjust continuously based on our conversations with commercial partners, providers, and customers. Today, we are distributing to 15,800 independent pharmacies, which is 30% of our business, so this is the most important strategic pillar today. That does not limit our focus on national pharmacy chains or supermarkets, which are also an important part of our business. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Médica Sur is one of the few publicly listed companies in the world that offer hospital services. What challenges do you face in this segment?<br></strong>In Mexico, we are the only one, and this is because the financial market in Mexico is small; however, listed companies need to share information and numbers with the public, and there is also the compliance aspect that requires hard work. You need a department dedicated exclusively to the Mexican Stock Exchange, and it demands you have several committees and a quarterly board meeting. This helps us to be transparent. We completed the remodeling of the hospital, purchased a PET CT equipment and new CT and MRI equipment, and updated most of the hospital's equipment and operating rooms. All these amounted to a MXN300-million investment. Hospitals require constant upgrading, because equipment usually lasts around 10 years.</p><p><strong>The private sector is contemplating creating a private universal healthcare system. Are you involved in this project?<br></strong>More than universal insurance, there has been talk amongst hospitals to consolidate purchases to make pricing more efficient. We have been working hard in the last few years to reduce the hospital's average invoice. We are the only high-specialty hospital in the country in the medium-cost range. This allows us to have a large orientation toward social medicine and provide services to a wider range of the population. We were working on this for the past two years, and it was completed in 2019. This means patients can access the best healthcare in the country at a second-level hospital cost. There are three high-level hospitals in Mexico: ABC, Angeles, and Médica Sur. We are the only one in the mid-range in terms of cost.</p><p><strong>What are your main objectives in the short to medium term?<br></strong>We maintain superior clinical quality and high medical ethics. Our hospital is focused 100% on the patient, and our indicators are better than the WHO's recommendations for patient safety, including infections, mortality rates, and hand washing. All these considerations make us the best hospital in Mexico. We want to reach a higher percentage of the population and be more profitable. We work extensively with doctors, who can give us first-hand information about patients. We are work with companies and insurers. The new equipment we purchased cost around USD1.5-2.5 million each. This is one of the reasons why healthcare is so expensive.</p><p><strong>You were contemplating separating the laboratory from the company. Can you tell us more about this?<br></strong>We published a document in the Mexican Stock Exchange to pay dividends with stocks from Laboratorio Médico Polanco and to change the stock control of the laboratory. One of the requirements was to obtain authorization from the National Stock Commission and the financial authorities of the country, which we did not receive. Therefore, we have refocused on operating the whole group and the laboratory is part of it, but it has a different strategy than the hospital. We have around 120 locations in seven states, which helps us to diversify and reach more patients.</p><p><strong>What is your vision of an ideal hospital?<br></strong>The human aspect of healthcare will always be necessary. Diagnostics will be faster, more efficient, and less invasive in terms of surgeries, leading to faster recoveries, shorter stays at the hospital, and lower costs. We are attracting doctors, changing our information systems, and building a digital medical storage system.</p><p><strong>Do you see great potential in medical tourism?<br></strong>Areas that have the highest rates of medical tourism are at the border, mainly Tijuana and Cancún. We have a medical tourism department that attract patients and shows them that our clinical quality is similar—and even superior—at half the cost or less, depending on their country of origin. Compared to the US, it can be up to seven times cheaper. We try to be a one-stop shop, booking flights, coordinating transportation from the airport, and accommodating patients at our hotel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe the importance of Mexico and the region in Siemens Healthineers' global strategy?<br></strong>Mexico is important in the global context because of the size of the market. Mexico is the second-largest market in the region and among the top 15 economies globally. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Mexico has a relevant place in the global context. We need to reinforce the health system here and change the mindset from one on treatment to one focused on prevention. We need to invest at a much faster pace compared to what we are currently doing. We are well behind the global average in areas like total healthcare expenditure. We must think positive and work hard to achieve better and more efficient healthcare for all Mexican citizens.</p><p><strong>What role do you see technology and innovation playing in overcoming the challenges and bridging the gaps in the market?<br></strong>Technology and innovation play a central and crucial role in our market. All the healthcare systems around the world are facing unprecedented challenges due to the pandemic. Our main focus is to support front line healthcare professionals, helping them to deliver high-value critical care. I believe this crisis will significantly change the way we think in healthcare. Medicine needs to be effective, efficient, and humanized. For sure, innovation and digital technologies play a significant role in this process. The final goal is to provide access to high-quality healthcare services. We must maintain a culture of innovation in order to continue our success. Companies in our sector invest 9-10% of their annual revenues in R&amp;D. We need to invest in innovation that is clinically advanced while also bringing benefits to large swathes of people. The big challenge for manufacturers is to make innovation as accessible as possible.</p><p><strong>What challenges are you facing in terms of implementing innovation and technology in the healthcare sector?<br></strong>The main challenge is maximizing accessibility. We need to solve the problem of making innovation available and accessible to our local market. For us, one of the potential solutions is looking at different business models. We are betting heavily on what we call value partnerships. This is different from the typical transactional model. In the end, the objective of this business model is to find a way to make innovation available all across the country. We also want innovation to be available to the public and the private sector alike.</p><p><strong>Are there any regional or local models that you can use as an example for your operations in Mexico?<br></strong>We share experiences and models with markets across Latin America. Additionally, we look at similar experiences in India or China. It can be difficult to learn from the US or Europe, but developing nations have strong similarities that inform processes and approaches. In Mexico, the health system is fragmented, and we do not have enough resources. When we look at healthcare, we usually split it into four steps: prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. Expenditure in the Mexican health sector is concentrated on the treatment phase and we need to invest more on prevention. Given the pandemic, there is an urgent need to learn and collaborate with other regions, such as Asia and Europe, that have already dealt with this situation. It is a matter of survival.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>Our main goal is to help our customers and Mexican population to emerge from this pandemic. Although this is not the best economic moment for Mexico, the healthcare sector needs to keep growing and developing. We want to be part of this process, helping the government with innovative technologies that treat any kind of disease, especially chronic diseases. We want to provide better results with lower costs. This is the challenge of every healthcare provider. We want to be seen as the enabler of such developments and a part of the solution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The essence of the organization allows us to move forward with a clear perspective in each of our projects. We also promote greater transparency and deliver comprehensive information online on water quality and other related issues. We now have methods to do a follow-up on all our procedures in order to tackle irregularity. Before, there was a delay due to a lack of transparency and problems appeared because we did not know who had received, authorized, or signed off on files. Today, there is complete traceability of all procedures. Another achievement is having strategic projects that will be developed throughout the sexennium. This allows us to pursue our tasks effectively and carry out these strategic projects together with the accompanying presidential projects.</p><p><strong>Which projects are you prioritizing for development?<br></strong>Each region in Mexico requires different solutions. To understand Mexico, it is necessary to understand how projects will vary depending on conditions in different regions of the country. Baja California is a beautiful area, for example, but it lacks water. It is surrounded by water and the Gulf of Cortez, which complicates the issue because a desalination plant needs to discharge brine, which cannot be dumped into the Gulf of Cortez. In Monterrey, we are developing La Libertad dam to solve important challenges when it comes to industrial access to water. Monterrey is one of the states with the highest GDP, but it also has a shortage of water. In the north and center, we face similar problems. In Sonora, the Pilares dam also presents a serious problem. Throughout the north of the country, we are doing a great deal of work regarding flood control. Rivers in Mexico are categorized as dry rivers, seasonal rivers, and salty rivers, because there are no permanent rivers as such given our clearly defined rainy seasons. It rains heavily, and cities and towns are not prepared for floods because it has never been profitable to invest in infrastructure. In Sinaloa, one of the main agricultural areas, we have projects that combine dams with river districts to provide adequate water for crops.</p><p><strong>In what ways are you incorporating PPAs into your model?<br></strong>The model is not universally applied, but rather selectively. For PPAs, one requires a viable prospect of repayment. The model is applied when there are more pressing needs such as in the north, where water for human consumption costs much more. We have an aqueduct in Veracruz that serves the petrochemical industry, and this project implements the PPA model because it is aimed at industry. Virtually 77% of CONAGUA's income from water rights comes from industries and the rest of the cities, where PPAs are a viable proposition. In the past, PPAs were promoted but in a slightly irrational way. PPAs for agriculture were created without a source of repayment. If you create a PPA and raise the water rates, people immediately associate that with the privatization of water. It is different in areas where there is no water and prices are high. The government is not against PPAs where there is a source of repayment and a reasonable profit margin.</p><p><strong>As urban centers continue to grow, how can Mexico provide sufficient water?<br></strong>This is a problem throughout Latin America, which overall has an urbanization rate of 80%. Mexico is among the highest due to the lack of standardized nationwide development. And today, we have many megacities, which require the kind of megaprojects that environmentalists object to. Megacities demand an ample supply of water and also discharge a large amount of waste, which is unsustainable. In hydraulic matters, Mexico has a strong pedigree that dates back to pre-Hispanic times. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In what ways did the company strengthen its portfolio in 2019?<br></strong>In 2019, we entered new therapeutic areas. For example, we are set to start a new psychiatric protocol. We are close to starting with vaccines as well. The vaccine protocols are different from what we usually do. Normally, there is phase one with volunteers, phase two with a small number of ill patients with low doses, phase three with more patients to measure security and efficacy, and phase four for pharmacovigilance; however, vaccines have different phases, and you need a high number of patients to apply the vaccine because you usually only apply it once. We are working on a vaccine for the syncytial virus in the elderly and children. We also working with gyneco, a vaccine for pregnant women, where we have to store a piece of the umbilical cord.</p><p><strong>How would you compare the company's results in 2019 to those of 2018?<br></strong>2019 was full of uncertainty. Our performance in 2019 was slower than in 2018. The new administration changed many things. It now takes a three-month period to issue medicine permits, whereas the previous administration did it in half that time. In fact, in 2019, some pharmaceutical companies decided to work abroad given the approval time in Mexico.</p><p><strong>What is your perspective on the decision of the administration to modify the public healthcare system?<br></strong>The issue is implementation. It looks great on paper, but in reality, you do not know how it will work. The public health system was already chaotic and problematic. It is a great proposal, but we have to see if it will work in practice. There is a shortage of specialist physicians as it is, and doctors do not want to work in the public system.</p><p><strong>We have heard of many changes in the government's process of selecting medicines for the public health system. What is your opinion on this?</strong><br>It is good that the government seeks to reduce monopolies in the healthcare industry, although it should not use generic medicines brought from India and China. We know within the industry that these medicines do not undergo the same quality processes as in Mexico. This is an ongoing issue that is yet to be solved. I agree that costs should fall, but definitely not at the cost of quality, efficacy, and safety.</p><p><strong>In terms of clinical research, what is your perspectives on the growth of the industry in Mexico?<br></strong>There are great opportunities, but these have always stalled due to regulatory obstacles. Our situation is similar to Brazil, where it takes around three to six months to start a project. Yet, when we need to recruit patients, we do better than other countries, thereby mitigating this with high turnout rates; however, companies would prefer a more stable regulatory setting. The government is also changing the customs regime, and we have to import medicines and supplies, which today requires a different process. In terms of global rankings, Mexico has not advanced.</p><p><strong>How do other regional countries compete with Mexico?<br></strong>Permit approval times are rather similar. Colombia is undergoing some reforms in terms of clinical research, but not everyone there wants to undertake research. The main players are Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. Chile and Peru are also strong players, but not as notable.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>Growth will be at around 20% for most projects, and the number of specialists will also increase. We are undergoing an internal restructuring, and will focus on quality control. 2020 looks like a promising year, where we have been nominated for an international business award for reliability. We have plans to use telemedicine in conjunction with actual patient visits. We will also open for business in Querétaro around June and focus on training and patient consultation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does Mexico play in Pierre Fabre's international strategy?<br></strong>For many years now, Mexico has been one of the development pillars for Pierre Fabre. Our Mexican operations will certainly continue to grow in the group's internal rankings, especially with the introduction of a new oncology portfolio in Mexico and Latin America. The company has two core businesses: dermo-cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The dermatology division is separate but it has strong synergies with our pharmaceutical division. Notably, we are working on an internal transformation plan that will boost our joint capabilities further. The plan includes digitalization, IT, logistics, R&amp;D, and stronger financial discipline. All this will further help us in building a solid future. Once this transformation plan has been executed, we will shift more of our focus to patients and consumers.</p><p><strong>How important is oncology for the company?<br></strong>Oncology remains paramount in the company's mid- and long-term strategy. We are committed to being a key player in this market, bringing novel treatments that will offer enhanced therapeutic alternatives for patients. Our goal is to not only improve their quality of life but increase life expectancy with lesser side effects. At Pierre Fabre, our core philosophy is that every time we take care of a person, we contribute to build a better world.</p><p><strong>What is your perception of the legal framework for healthcare in Mexico?<br></strong>The situation of the healthcare system in Mexico still remains somehow unpredictable and undefined. The new government brought in a great deal of disruption, so I am optimistic and hope that this first year of disruption will be the starting point for new and improved structures, organizations, and processes. We remain on hold and expect to see if the government will be able to consolidate the national healthcare system, improve the regulatory and access capabilities, and consider innovation as one of the key development poles. The question remains on how they will untangle and finance all the issues in order to avoid a shortage of products.</p><p><strong>What is your distribution strategy in Mexico?<br></strong>We distribute our pharmaceuticals through large wholesalers. In the retail segment, more and more regional mid-sized distributors will gain share and robust pharmacy chains will grow and expand further. As a result, independent pharmacies will suffer. Our strategy is to continue with our current distribution partnership model, but as the entire setting will surely evolve in the next five years, we will follow new trends and remain strongly committed to our distribution partners and grow with them, especially in the e-commerce arena. The challenge overall, and our core responsibility, is to make sure that patients and consumers can easily access our products at the best price.</p><p><strong>What main trends in the healthcare industry are you keeping track of?<br></strong>Governments and pharmaceutical companies should work together to prevent tropical diseases that can be avoided or minimized. In that light, a prevention system should be classified as a national priority. Moreover, Mexico and other regional countries have an aging population, so we must continue to invest in R&amp;D, technology, genomics, and robotics.</p><p><strong>What countries are you prioritizing in Latam?<br></strong>Our priorities remain Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina. We are planning to work with our strategic partners to expand into Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Ecuador.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals for 2020?<br></strong>In Latin America, one of our main goals is to roll out our new portfolio for oncology, especially in Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. 2020 will also be the year of consolidation with strong partnerships in Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile. At the same time, we will continue to invest, build, and grow with our current portfolios across Central America. The next few years in Latin America will be challenging, as unpredictability and volatility will be the main drivers of the market. In light of that, it is crucial that we remain financial and ethically<br>disciplined. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your mission as Pfizer's country manager for Mexico?<br></strong>Mexico is one of the most important markets in Latin America, and it is also one of the most important markets for Pfizer. The company is recognized as the leading pharmaceutical company in the country because of the reputation it has built over the past seven years. We have been recognized for our commitment to transparency: in January 2020, we received a certificate for our transparent practices by CETIFARMA, and in 2019, we were rated as the best company to work for in Mexico. We are a strong company in Mexico, and we are committed to this country and the wellbeing of our patients, who are placed at the center of everything we do. We focus our efforts on research and advances, talent acquisition and development, as well as transforming the current commercial model and earning our place in the technological race within the pharmaceutical sector. We have been in Mexico for the past 70 years, committed to the health of all Mexicans; our goal is to benefit 5 million recipients in 2020. We will launch five new products in 2020. We are extremely proud to announce our first biosimilar product for the oncology portfolio in Mexico.</p><p><strong>How has COVID-19 impacted Pfizer's business model in Mexico?<br></strong>We monitor all sources of information regarding COVID-19, and our effort goes toward supporting our patients and colleagues. Pfizer has adopted five strategies that will help scientists bring forward therapies and vaccines to protect humankind from this escalating pandemic and prepare the industry to better respond to future health crises. First, Pfizer is committed to releasing its vital tools on an open source platform for the broader scientific community and to sharing data with other companies in real time to rapidly advance therapies and vaccines to patients. Second, human capital is our most valuable resource, and we have created a SWAT team of leading virologists, biologists, chemists, clinicians, epidemiologists, vaccine experts, pharmaceutical scientists, and other key experts to focus solely on addressing this pandemic. Third, although many smaller biotech companies are screening compounds or existing therapies to fight the coronavirus, some lack the experience in late-stage development; therefore, Pfizer is committed to sharing its clinical development and regulatory expertise to support the most promising candidates these companies bring forward. Fourth, once a therapy or vaccine is approved, it will need to be rapidly scaled and deployed around the world to put an end to this pandemic, and as one of the largest manufacturers of vaccines and therapeutics, Pfizer is committed to supporting others in rapidly getting these life-saving breakthroughs into the hands of patients as quickly as possible. Finally, Pfizer is reaching out to federal agencies including NIH, NIAID, and CDC with plans to build a cross-industry rapid response team of scientists, clinicians, and technicians that is able to move into action immediately when future epidemics surface.</p><p><strong>How has the pandemic impacted Pfizer? <br></strong>So far, we have not seen a significant difference in demand. We are working across the globe to ensure that our production does not decline, so that our patients can obtain the treatment they need.</p><p><strong>What are your priorities for 2020 and 2021?<br></strong>Our main goal is aligned with our purpose: breakthroughs that change patients' lives. Innovation, when it comes to health, is about improving people's lives. Yes, it is about research and development of new therapies and manufacturing meds, but it is also about the creation of digital platforms to accompany our patients. Pfizer is among the global pharma companies that invest the most in R&amp;D, with 15% of its revenue directed toward it. In 2019, this figure was USD8 billion. Investing in research is still very much our priority for 2020. Our plan is to launch 13 new products by 2022. Another one of our priorities is to maintain our position as the number-one company in terms of excellence and transparency. We want to be part of Mexico's economic and productive development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How did you develop your innovative business plan that sees you competing with a different model of transportation?</strong><br>When we look at the transportation market in Mexico, air trips per capita were only around 0.3-0.4 in 2019, while 40 years ago it was 0.22. It has not shown much growth. In reality, Mexico is one of the largest bus transportation markets in the world. When we analyzed the market, we concluded that the purchasing capacity of our customers was generally limited because airfares were high in Mexico. We decided to develop a model of aviation under which we could offer extremely low fares so that we could compete against buses. Today, 41% of our routes do not compete with other airlines but instead against buses. We focused on certain niches, and this allowed us to capitalize on these markets. Women are now working far more and incorporating themselves into the equation, and this means we must target women as well as men. Additionally, the vast majority of the people we are targeting are young people, who travel frequently and want certain things. For example, we have to communicate with them through digital channels. Part of what we have done is move into these channels faster than other airlines. We earn only a small percentage of our total revenues through travel agencies, including online travel agencies. Everything else is sold either through our webpage or the mobile application.</p><p><strong>How does your business model protect itself from going out of business, which has been the fate of many other Mexican airlines?</strong><br>It is driven by cost. Volaris has the lowest operating unit cost in the Western hemisphere. Our costs are so low that we can produce far lower prices for customers. Most of the time, our total revenue per available seat mile, which is our unit measure for revenue, is below the cost of the entire global industry.</p><p><strong>What kind of strategy does Volaris use to expand both nationally and internationally?</strong><br>It is important to stick to what we are doing here. In reality, we are a point-to-point operation, and this eliminates the fact that we have to pass through the Mexico City Airport. It is also important to understand that bus transportation is the base of this business. We can expand to wherever we like, though it has to be point-to-point and where we can do bus switching. Further, it has to be somewhere where we have a price advantage over our competitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your vision for ISSSTE?<br></strong>ISSSTE is Mexico's second-largest social security institution. We serve and protect 13.5 million entitlement holders, or one in 10 Mexicans. In 2020, ISSSTE is commemorating its 60th anniversary by transforming itself to serve better. We provide health services, pensions, housing credits, personal loans, childcare facilities, social tourism, sports facilities, day centers, a spa, a convive center, and stores for basic staples supply at reasonable prices, and even an administrator of retirement funds. My vision is to provide our entitlement holders with insurance, services, and benefits established by law, and to do so at high-quality standards, under a constant process of quality improvement and with our entitlement holders at the very center of all our activities and goals, in an environment of solid finances and with a steady effort to move toward a preventive healthcare model.</p><p><strong>What are your main priorities and objectives?<br></strong>I have defined three main objectives for ISSSTE. First, to improve the quality of services we provide, with a kinder, more respectful approach toward state workers and their families. Second, we aim to evolve our healthcare model toward prevention instead of our current curative approach. Third, we want to consolidate long-term finances as the foundation for proper protection and support for our entitlement holders. To achieve these objectives, we must continue with the extensive reorganization already in process. A top priority is to invest more in training for our people, especially those that directly deal with the public, and to recover a sense of purpose and social responsibility. We shall achieve high standards so that we provide a healthcare service that is more effective, empathic, and kinder by the day.</p><p><strong>In what ways has the COVID-19 pandemic changed the model and vision of the Mexican public health system?<br></strong>It has been a tremendous challenge for us all. It has showed us that in times of emergency, our greatest asset remains our people, who are determined to serve, help, and reach out to others in need. They are serving beyond duty. We also have a number of health workers over 60, and we gave them the opportunity to protect themselves at home. As expected, the emergency exposed our weaknesses in infrastructure, equipment, processes, protocols, and personnel. All are consequences of years of underinvestment, and at times even neglect. Corruption and waste of resources were problems that we are fully determined to eliminate. We remain fully committed to this objective, and we are confident we shall prevail in this demanding hour. Obviously, no healthcare system in the world was fully prepared to face this pandemic, but clearly, we must consolidate a health system fully grounded in the idea of education for a healthy life and in prevention.</p><p><strong>What has been ISSSTE's greatest contribution when it comes to the pandemic?<br></strong>Our greatest effort has been providing healthcare services and other social services while tackling the needs of COVID-19 patients. Since January, we started with preventive and educational messages related to the disease and how to better protect ourselves. We have been able to guarantee a regular supply of safety equipment for our health personnel and quickly respond to most of their concerns. In 2019, we worked on transforming ISSSTE in two new areas: planning and supervision. During the pandemic, some of the fruits of these new areas became apparent, namely having data and precise information for decision making, from the diagnosis of our capabilities and weaknesses to face the emergency to a proper evaluation of the allocation of resources and the definition of a route to follow. Furthermore, ISSSTE has been providing health services to all Mexicans during the COVID-19 emergency, even if they are not entitlement holders. We are fully determined to contribute to the national effort to overcome the emergency, and we shall succeed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your perspective of the current health industry given the changes taking place in the country?<br></strong>Change always presents opportunities, especially now given the developments in Mexico's healthcare environment, particularly in the public segment, which is Pharma Tycsa's main area of concern. This change promises to be positive, as the president has acknowledged that dominant players were controlling the market, thereby curbing competition, making for high prices and lax quality. The only downside at the moment is uncertainty as to where the industry is going. Sales have declined, and payments from the public sector have been delayed. For example, the Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers (ISSSTE) has not paid a single invoice for the whole year thus far. We are not getting any answers from the government on this, although I have faith in its determination to address the situation.</p><p><strong>What strategies is Pharma Tycsa using to diversify its portfolio to mitigate these risks?<br></strong>Pharma Tycsa is pursuing private markets, especially through its newest division—oncology and nutrition. Pharma Tycsa started out as a pharmaceutical distributor for the government, and three years ago we launched this new division and invested in open drug compounding centers. There are three areas where we process drugs through compounding centers: nutrition, for example, compounded food for premature babies to be fed by tube; oncology; and antibiotics. At our compounding center, we prepare chemotherapy treatments. It involves opening drugs, mixing, preparing, and then repackaging them for patients to receive chemotherapy by catheter. We built the laboratory and it is regulated by COFEPRIS. We do not manufacture the drugs; they are sourced from various pharmaceutical companies.</p><p><strong>What other investment opportunities has Pharma Tycsa identified?<br></strong>Even though compounding practices are regulated by COFEPRIS, there was a monopoly of one company in Mexico that operated 90% of compounding laboratories. We started investing three years ago, and it took us two years to become licensed. The opening up of the industry will ultimately be positive for players and patients alike. Since the new administration came in, most of the monopoly-owned drug compounding centers have been shut down for not complying with regulations, presenting us with a prime opportunity. Today, there are only around five private companies doing this work, including Pharma Tycsa. Over the past three years, we invested around USD3 million and built four drug compounding centers for public and private healthcare providers alike. We want to invest a further USD5 million over the next two years and open seven or eight additional centers. That will depend on the government's plans for the sector.</p><p><strong>Are there any other main projects that Pharma Tycsa is working on?<br></strong>The company celebrated its 10th anniversary in October. Another group objective in healthcare is kidney dialysis, where we currently have five centers serving over 300 patients. Again, with the new regulations and the government's willingness to expand the market, we are also willing to invest in the renal area. We have a business plan to invest around USD3 million in additional dialysis centers over the next two years.</p><p><strong>How does Pharma Tycsa plan to expand beyond Mexico?<br></strong>We are planning to open a chemotherapy center in Peru. Tycsa Medical, our sister company, already has two centers in Lima with laboratory imaging and kidney dialysis. We own the building there and plan to open a chemotherapy practice there in 2020.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals for 2020?<br></strong>About 60% of our business is distribution and 40% drug compounding. My priority is to invest more in the compounding area. We have the infrastructure to support our commercial partners, namely the laboratories, and will continue to help them move their products nationwide. Depending on where the market is headed, we are willing to invest in new services and programs that are in line with the government's quality healthcare goals.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the main areas of opportunity that you have identified in the healthcare industry?<br></strong>I see a lot of opportunities. The way the new government is approaching universal coverage is something that we need as a country. Past efforts to achieve universal coverage barely succeeded, so achieving it in the near future will bode well for the general population and the healthcare sector.</p><p><strong>What role can Stendhal Pharma play when it comes to universal coverage in Mexico?<br></strong>We are a Mexican pharmaceutical company but the beauty of our model is that we represent a lot of innovative companies from around the world. We do business with almost every continent, and we always bring innovative products for patients and innovative solutions for governments. The government's plan to increase access to healthcare represents a potential business opportunity for us and the entire pharmaceutical sector.</p><p><strong>Are your main laboratories located in Mexico?<br></strong>We have a manufacturing plant in Mexico, but since we have business with different partners across the world, we have different business models. Some partners send us finished products. In other cases, we receive the product in bulk, make the final conditioning, and sell it to the final customer. At the end, our focus is on providing business solutions based on our partner's needs and vision.</p><p><strong>Is the company planning to invest in increasing its production capacity in the near future?<br></strong>Yes, that is in our plans. Even though we are a Mexican pharmaceutical company, our revenue in 2018 was above USD200 million, putting us among the top-15 pharmaceutical companies in Mexico. That proves that our business model is a successful one. We are the partner of choice for a number of companies establishing their operations in Mexico and Latam. At present, we are developing at least five new partnerships. We forged these partnerships partly because of the trends in the healthcare sector, such as epidemiology. Our partnerships also depend on the strategy we are pursuing as a company; we are 100% focused on innovative products and do not manage generic products.</p><p><strong>Can you give us a breakdown of the company's portfolio?<br></strong>We have products for a range of diseases, from HIV to central nervous system diseases and multiple sclerosis. We also manage chronic and cardiovascular diseases. Regarding epidemiology, our challenge is to produce better antibiotics. We are also exploring different business opportunities and making partnerships with big pharmaceutical companies that are investing heavily in R&amp;D. Some of these companies don't have the expertise to promote their products, which is why we are developing partnerships with them. That is a new business model that we are exploring. We expect to sign two important contracts before the end of 2019.</p><p><strong>How is the market reacting to your new Fimasartán + Amlodipino product?<br></strong>This is the most innovative product to treat hypertension. We partnered with a Korean company to introduce this in Mexico. Equally important, we have partnered with Medics, a Mexican company, to launch a new diabetes product, which is one of the most prevalent diseases in Mexico.</p><p><strong>What strategies are you using to strengthen your presence in Latin America?<br></strong>Our strategy for Mexico is different. The main challenge in Central American countries is IP rights. We listen to our customers in different countries to understand their needs and bring them different solutions at a good price.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals and priorities for 2020?<br></strong>Our main goal is to continue strengthening our portfolio in the different therapies that we manage, such as anti-infectives, cardiovascular disease, central nervous system disease, multiple sclerosis, and oncology. Our second priority is to partner with the Mexican government. The right approach to deal with challenges facing the healthcare system is one based on PPPs. We also want to continue developing and retaining all the talent that is working for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What motivated you to invest in Capitanes?<br></strong>It was based on my passion for basketball and not having any sport to follow in Mexico City. My decision to invest in Capitanes coincided with Kobe Bryant's retirement. When he retired, I was with a friend, who is also a partner at Capitanes, and we both talked about what to do in our free time after Kobe's retirement. We decided to look into Mexican basketball. We started investigating and realized that the basketball scene in Mexico was even smaller than we thought. That said, there were basketball fans because basketball is the third-most followed sport in the country. I arranged a meeting with the president of the Mexican professional league and discussed what was necessary to create a Mexico City team. He gave a lot of information and ideas, which we used to work on the project. Our main purpose was to create something that we would enjoy watching as fans of the game, but as soon as we got into it, we saw the huge potential on offer.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the objective behind Capitanes joining the NBA G League?<br></strong>The NBA is the best league in the world, and we have modelled Capitanes according to the NBA. For us, it is important that the NBA is looking at Mexico now. In Capitanes, we have found a great way to give more exposure to local players and represent Mexico in a US league.</p><p><strong>How was the performance of Capitanes in the first year?<br></strong>Initially, we were not able to create more revenue but we saw the light at the end of the tunnel and what we needed to do to get there. In the first season, everything surpassed our expectations. For example, the stadium was 80% full in the middle of the season. From that game onward, our attendance only increased. The players got really close to us and started loving the team and what we represented. With all this positive energy, we ended up getting into the finals. I feel that in Mexican basketball, there is no concept of entertainment other than the sport itself, which is why we focused on making the experience pleasant, even for those who do not enjoy basketball. Everything that has happened since then has been a big surprise, including getting into the G League.</p><p><strong>What strategies are you using to ensure your team can compete at the highest level?<br></strong>Everything that we lack in experience we make up with passion. What separates us from other teams is that our base is made of Mexican players. Even the international players in our team are from Spanish-speaking countries. This clicked with the players and fans. We started supporting the players, which was new to them since other owners suspended them for wanting to create a union. This allowed us to establish close relationships with the players. Even players from the opposing team would celebrate with us and show their interest in joining the team. This was unheard of before. Our goal is to represent Latin America. We want to create a clear pathway for Latin American players to join the NBA. Our biggest achievement would be when a player from Capitanes ends up in the NBA. This is our main focus from here on. </p><p><strong>What have you done to adapt to the COVID-19 epidemic?<br></strong>We are figuring out what our future opportunities are as it is a good time to tell our story and get more active on social media. We can bring fans into the whole process by creating videos to get people closer to the team. We want to give an inside look of the amazing journey that we have been on over the last three seasons. One option is to get involved with e-sports, and we are looking to do that in the medium term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mexico's Liga MX is considered among the top 10 in the world. How can it make it into the top five or three?<br></strong>There will always be competition between football leagues concerning the audience. On one hand, there is the natural struggle to have the best players possible, which involves adequate investments, bringing in talented international players, and developing solid Mexican players. Then, we need to factor in things such as excellent stadiums with quality transport links and catering. Liga MX is among the top 10 and always faces the challenge by improving year by year.</p><p><strong>What steps is FEMEXFUT taking to prepare for the 2026 World Cup?<br></strong>We are working with FIFA and federations from Canada and the US in order to define the 16 final venues that will host the event: three in Canada, three in Mexico, and 10 in the US. The final decision will be made in 2H2020. There will be 16 venues for 80 matches, out of which 10 will take place in Canada, 10 in Mexico, and 60 in the US. That was part of the bid terms, although the final decision will be made by the FIFA president and remains to be determined. It is a long project because after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, we will step on the gas for 2026. Meanwhile, there are still some decisions of a technical nature as we can only speculate as to the nature of technology available in 2026. Those final technological requirements will be set on the table late in 2022 or in early 2023. We already have the infrastructure ready, however. If the matches were to be played next week, Canada, Mexico, and the US could host the event because the stadiums are already built, and we have the required airports, hotels, hospitals, and training sites. Everything is ready, though the requirements will change in the upcoming years, and we will have to make some improvements. Brazil, South Africa, and Qatar are the best examples of where previous competitions were a huge issue because they had to build stadiums. This will be the first World Cup hosted by three countries. It is also noteworthy because Mexico will become the first country to host three World Cups. We previously hosted the event in 1970 and 1986.</p><p><strong>What role does Mexican football play in the broader economy?<br></strong>It is tough to say. In the first division, there are 450-500 professional players, so this is an industry of 500 top-flight players. Then, there is the under 17s, under 20s, and women's leagues, so we are talking about 2,000 players. For any big company, that is a small number. However, we are highly visible on TV, radio, and social networks. As for our online presence, we are competing with Brazil in terms of fans and followers on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Snapchat. When we compare Mexico to other federations by national team, we rank number two. Brazil is number one, though Brazil's numbers include the leagues. If we add the Liga MX numbers to that, we would be the number one in the world. For an industry with 2,000 professional employees, that is fairly impressive.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for 2020?<br></strong>2020 is a year to consolidate. In 2H2020, we will begin playing the qualifiers for the World Cup in Qatar. Another goal is to help the players of the under-17 Warrior, which recently got the second position in Brazil. If we can help these players, it will be a huge achievement toward 2026 and 2030. Our focus is on improving our four pillars, namely sporting success, sports justice, international relations, and social responsibility. We want to promote football further because we are fully aware of its impact on our affiliates and followers. After all, it inspires Mexicans in a positive way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>At what point in your career did you become internationally famous as a representative of Oaxacan cuisine?<br></strong>I am glad to hear that people consider me an ambassador of Oaxacan cuisine; I never thought that this would happen. I started cooking by accident as a teenager in junior high school; however, I fell in love with food service and loved taking care of people in hospitality. After a year of working in a restaurant, I wanted a diploma as a waiter. I moved to Puerto Escondido to take a three-month course and ended up staying there for 10 years working in a hotel called Santa Fe, where I met my mentor. Subsequently, I moved to Oaxaca and met three amazing individuals who had chosen to retire in Oaxaca City. When I met them, they invited me to their home, which was called Casa Oaxaca. There were no boutique hotels in Oaxaca in 1997. They had a house where they wanted to represent Oaxacan culture—art, food, decorations, and so on. When I saw this house, I had two ideas: open a Spanish school for English speakers or open a restaurant, although I had never gone to a culinary school. And they allowed me to bring my concept to fruition and eventually grow the international reputation of Oaxacan cuisine by providing meals with fresh and local ingredients.</p><p><strong>What was the main added value of Casa Oaxaca at that time?<br></strong>Our restaurant did not have a menu. We would see what we had in the kitchen, create a new menu for the day with the ingredients available, and close when the food ran out. When we decided to work together, the deal was that I would open my restaurant in Casa Oaxaca and help take care of the hotel. Since then, Casa Oaxaca Hotel has been my second home for 24 years. There were only three people working there when I arrived. We realized that our only chance to survive in the market was to make it deeply personal. I would go to the market to buy fresh vegetables and fruit at 6am, and at 8am I would offer three or four choices. I would often buy fruits that were rare or weren't used in other parts of Mexico, such as zapote negro or mamey, and create an experience for customers with that local produce. For lunch, I would buy the best fish, vegetables, and beans I could find and make an appetizer, a salad, a soup, a main dish, and dessert. Another thing was that if I had customers leaving early, breakfast would be prepared earlier for them. Our guests would insist that I not wake up that early to send them breakfast, but we would prepare it for them no matter if it was 5am or 8am. That's what has given us this special feeling for 24 years and why our occupancy rate is 94%.</p><p><strong>What is behind popularity of Mexican food around the world?<br></strong>We are extremely proud of who we are and where we come from. We are also proud of our culture.  We have an identity, and it is top quality. Oaxaca is not a cheap destination. Chiapas and Yucatán are not exotic, but we are not folkloric either. The most important thing about it is that we have a core identity that is top quality, and with everything becoming smaller with globalization, it is important to know that there are undiscovered locations in Mexico.</p><p><strong>In what ways will COVID-19 affect the hospitality industry?<br></strong>We are using technology to keep in touch with our friends, families, and clients. One can preserve their traditions and identity, but there is no way they can stay separate from technology in today's world. We are still preserving our roots, tastes, and flavors. Technology is something I use, but people offer a special charm. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How is Mexico Travel Channel contributing to the Mexican tourism industry?<br></strong>We focus on the tourism industry, which is one of the main sectors in Mexico. The original owners of the channel wanted to sell it, and we acquired it on December 31, 2018. The current owner is Gin Talent and Entertainment. The brand was not touched by the new owner because Mexico Travel Channel is a well-established brand in the country.</p><p><strong>What impact has the pandemic had on your business?<br></strong>We have been severely impacted because Mexico Travel Channel broadcasts a great deal of content that is recorded outdoors, and currently it is not possible to go out as part of the contingency measures to stop the spread of the disease. We have done most of our content remotely as a result. The coronavirus crisis is under control in Asia and Europe, so we expect things to gradually return to normal in Mexico as well, which will benefit the tourism sector. The majority of tourism businesses have been heavily impacted, with some surveys estimating that up to 30% of tourism-related businesses could shut down.</p><p><strong>What role do you play in the tourism sector, and how can you work to reactivate this sector?<br></strong>Mexico Travel Channel is a business; we need to be a profitable channel that generates income. At the same time, we have to pay attention to the current situation. We are part of the tourism ecosystem and have to do something to reactivate the industry. We can achieve that by working closely with the authorities. In addition, we have to stay in touch with the private sector, including hotel chains and airlines, for example. We have to work together with the private and public sectors as well as SMEs, which have been heavily impacted by the situation.</p><p><strong>How much interest is there in domestic tourism?<br></strong>Our impression is that Mexicans are not that interested in their own country and might prefer to visit other countries. However, Mexico has many things to offer, and we can use this situation to tell Mexicans that domestic tourism is a better option these days. For example, Oaxaca and Chiapas offer great opportunities to discover new places. Mexicans should travel around Mexico to find the variety of opportunities on offer. I have seen some pictures of Mexico that I cannot even believe were taken here. There will be great opportunities to travel at affordable prices.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How many users does Twitch have in Mexico?<br></strong>At present, we have between 5 and 6 million users. Now that everyone is in lockdown, we have noticed a lot of changes in how people consume content. We are noticing a big surge in growth but we do not have any numbers yet because it is still ongoing. I can say with confidence that 20-30% growth is doable. Our main demographic is people aged between 18 and 24 but that varies heavily depending on the channel. There are some channels that attract a much older audience. Similarly, some channels target teenagers with more stories and fast-paced content. We also have channels that target different age groups, such as fitness channels and cooking channels.</p><p><strong>What opportunities does Twitch offer to companies regarding brand promotion?<br></strong>The best way I try to describe it to people is that we are not here just to complete your KPIs because you can probably do that with a lot of other platforms. We provide more of a creative solution. For us, everything is centered around content and being creative about the way we solve things. We did a campaign with Papa John's where people could participate in a contest and win a free pizza. It became wildly popular because it gave people the chance to win a pizza in real time. </p><p><strong>What challenges did Twitch face when entering the Latam market? <br></strong>In the beginning, everything was US centric. All our servers were there and there were no localized payment solutions. Slowly, we started taking different business development initiatives to integrate with what works here. Nowadays, if you want to subscribe to a channel on Twitch, you can just go to OXXO or 7-Eleven.</p><p><strong>What are your main priorities for 2020?<br></strong>My main priority is educating users. Our teams in Brazil and Mexico are primarily focused on onboarding new people. In Argentina, for example, Kun Aguero, a famous football player, is using Twitch to interact with people. Twitch was a new platform back then and he did not know how to set up his stream, so we started offering tools and apps to let people use Twitch more easily. More and more important business and companies are going digital and we are telling them exactly what will work and what will not work. So, raising awareness is going to be the focus for the rest of the year because there has been a surge in the number of people trying the platform out.</p><p><strong>How are you helping companies learn how to use Twitch it for brand promotion?<br></strong>We recently hired someone who helped us understand how companies that are not tech savvy look at the digital world. We created presentations, frameworks, and tutorials to deal with the needs and challenges of new users. We try to offer a 360-degree solution and help people produce quality content. We also assist people in choosing the best way to advertise. It is all about being patient and explaining that this is a completely different world and that they need to look at it with a fresh mindset. Once companies realize this, they understand the potential of what they can do on Twitch.</p><p><strong>What is your business model and in what ways do you monetize the platform?<br></strong>We monetize the platform in many ways. We have the user generation monetization, which is basically when people buy a subscription or one of our digital products to interact with the broadcaster. Then, there is Twitch Prime, which is a joint product in partnership with Amazon, our parent company. In Mexico, we are working with our regional partner IMS. We are also building our own media team and advertising team. We are not just a media platform; we are a content platform, so we always try to work with influencers and content creators on new formats. It has to be creative because people can advertise anywhere on the internet. What we offer is unique content. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which business segments would you like to have a stronger presence in?</h4><p>We strive to become a greater partner for segments where we already participate. One is in agriculture, for which we have products and technology that we are already offering. Agriculture shows amazing potential in Mexico, along with the automotive sector. They are two fast-growing segments in Mexico, and we have a key role to play there. Personal care is also an interesting market with growing sales. There are also opportunities in the protein business and animal nutrition, since Mexico plays an important role globally in protein production. Another area of opportunity is in activities connected to sustainability in energy and waste treatment. We have multiple projects in the energy sector, and we are engaged in dealing with the topic of plastics and chemical recycling in support of the circular economy strategy. Biogas is another topic we are discussing here. We are continuing our work in wastewater treatment. Now, it is time to materialize the country's goals and see how we can help. Thus far, we have been talking about potential and how important it is to see it in Mexico; however, it is time to take a more hands-on strategy. As a specialty chemical company, we play a leading role and have a moral and social obligation to drive the necessary changes for a more sustain-able business in Mexico.</p><h4>What factors are behind Mexico's resilience in the export market?</h4><p>It has an interesting combination of exports. There are certain industries with extremely strong ties to export markets, not just traditional ones. The automotive industry was in the “driver's seat" for many years. We also see significant growth in the aero-space sector, as well as agriculture and other segments with increasing exports and thus a stronger role in the global economy. Additionally, there is a growing middle class in Mexico driving the economy and consumption. Many of our customers are connected to this middle-class growth in the local market.</p><h4>Why is it important to establish closer ties between the chemical industry and the new administration?</h4><p>It is important that the chemical industry, through the Chemical Industry National Association (ANIQ), wants to establish a closer relationship to the new administration and discuss opportunities in the sector and market that benefit the people of Mexico. The chemicals industry is growing in Mexico, though production has not caught up due to local constraints. That means we continue relying on imports. Although we have the capacity, it is not utilized, mainly because we lack access or supply to key elements and resources such as natural gas or raw materials from the downstream petrochemicals industry. But the industry is committed, and ANIQ wants to support local production and satisfy needs by producing locally; however, we need to align with the current administration further to find a way to team up and work together for a sustainable chemical industry in Mexico and create good impact on people's well-being.</p><h4>Will you be increasing imports to increase production?</h4><p>For Evonik, bringing new capacities and production to Mexico in specialty chemicals depends on the current raw materials supply and local infrastructure, which is still not there. For the time being, we will focus more on relying on imports that we bring from Europe, the US, and all other global assets from Evonik Industries, and eventually find ways to add value through local manufacturing or teaming up with local players for the production of products and technologies. There is capacity in-stalled and an industry keen to support that growth and demand in Mexico; however, we rely and aim on consolidating a stronger relationship with the authorities, Pemex, and other suppliers in order to be able to run sustainable production and businesses in Mexico. At the end of the day, that will give us the necessary competitive advantage to motivate the private sector to continue investing and remain committed to Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the short-term strategies that you have had to take in order to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic? How has this impacted your operations?</h4><p>I will try to speak in a general manner. As you know, I do not manage the operational side of the subsidiaries. I work for the holding company, meaning I manage the corporate parts, the shareholders, instead. This is why I will touch on your operational questions by giving simple and generic answers. I will not get into the details of the operational parts. Overall, COVID-19 has had two significant impacts. Firstly, it has impacted some developing parts such as Virgin or Kiabi, which are not dedicated to “food distribution.“ We are developing Virgin for cultural products, Kiabi for textiles, and Burger King for the fast food part. These three subsidiaries have been stationary for ten days. These days, the turnover is null and these subsidiaries' management of is based on how to cope with the turnover's halt, how to manage the rest of the costs, the treasury, the payrolls, etc. Like many companies in the world, we are experiencing a complete cessation of all activity. On the other hand, our food distribution line embodied by Carrefour is experiencing the opposite situation. We are facing a customer rush. Looking at the last 10 days, our turnover is about 25% to 30% superior to that of last year at the same period despite the restrictions and obstacles we face in the supply chain and the like, as you may guess. These are our two axes.</p><h4>With regards to stock, are you confident about the smooth running of the supply chain in terms of logistics and of employees. How are you handling this?</h4><p>Development is at a standstill. That is to say that all the files that were being reviewed these past 6 or 12 or 18 months, partnerships with other countries like South Africa, England, Spain, Portugal, Italy... Today, all these development projects are at a standstill. To be clear, our first axis is about food distribution and Carrefour; the second regards other subsidiaries that are at a standstill; the third one is about our development projects in the making. Let us start with the first axis. Overall, we are trying to overcome three major difficulties. Firstly are sanitary challenges, secondly are HR challenges, and thirdly there is the supply chain element. Let us talk briefly about the sanitary part. As you know, we are a franchise of a large international group. This entails we are within international standards for all matters of protection, be it of customers, of partners or of our employees, at various levels. Especially regarding the people most exposed such as cashiers, supermarket employees, especially specialty workers handling fresh products such as butchers, fishmongers, etc. We have taken a lot of sanitary measures in terms of changing gloves and masks, plexiglass partitions to protect employees from customers. These measures meet international standards and protocols.</p><h4>So you haven't recorded any case of COVID-19?</h4><p>No, no cases. Carrefour France has had cases. We, hamdulillah, have not had a case either in Morocco or in Ivory Coast. You should know that there are still almost 11,000 people between Morocco and Cí´te d'Ivoire. In the latter we manage a food distribution company called CDCI, which is not Carrefour. CDCI represents 150 stores throughout the country and around 2,500 people. The HR difficulties we encounter are psychological difficulties, time management, transport, confinement, mail delays, surveillance, and so on. These are fairly complicated, though we seek to work hand in hand with the local authorities in each city. We must not forget that we serve public interest. The local and national authorities grant us many privileges and support us in keeping the stores running. We have many providers for matters of security, surveillance, cleaning and hygiene, transporters, and so on. The teams of the various service providers who interact with us on the 110 stores that we have today in Morocco add up to our own teams. The third difficulty lies in the supply chain. We have a great deal of stock: the equivalent of several months, though not for all products. We have created a box for products that are stored and other products that are not. Here as well, we are experiencing more or less significant difficulties in terms of local production and imports. Even if our brand keeps receiving imports, importers and exporters from foreign countries are facing a slowdown and hardships related to the crisis. We still receive several deliveries a day in order to face the rush. These are the three main difficulties that we encounter in terms of food distribution.</p><h4>If this situation continues for longer than expected, do you have any measures in place regarding HR?</h4><p>There are “positive“ problems for Carrefour such as a surplus of work. If things continue this way, we will most likely have to recruit temporary workers. We should be able to keep operating on our current provisions until the end of April but will have to resort to temporary workers if it continues. Development projects are slackening off significantly compared to Carrefour, namely the stores that are opening, the stores in construction, the stores that we are developing, and so on. The pace has slowed down slightly. But we have had an additional turnover of about 20%, which is already enormous. Even during the best years combined with our development efforts, we have never progressed as much within a single year. If it continues this way, it is already significant. We were supposed to open around 20 projects this year, though given the situation, opening a dozen would be an achievement. In any case, 2020 will be largely positive compared to last year.</p><h4>Considering air traffic is closed and maritime traffic is significantly decreased, do you face difficulties in terms of international logistics to move your products?</h4><p>Some things are slower. I cannot tell you more since I am not the holding company. What I do know is that international imports in general have slowed down. They have not stopped, but they are slower. We are facing obstacles that did not exist before. Products still circulate internationally, even if it is not as fluid as before.</p><h4>How are you expanding digitalization and new technologies?</h4><p>We have two strategic projects underway across the group: a CSR project and a digitalization project. Each subsidiary is now working with its parent company to maximize the digitalization of loyalty products, internet access, sales, and so on. Each subsidiary has its own projects with its own criteria and characteristics; the digitalization of Burger King is different from that of Kiabi. Each city has its area of competence that defines its overall strategic project. All cities prioritize digitalization while making progress on CSR projects.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for digitalization in retail? People still like to go to the store; we haven't really seen a change. But we are starting to see some home deliveries. Are there any other opportunities in that area?</h4><p>We are facing a lot of difficulties. As you know, the containment strategy here in Morocco is quite strict. We tried home deliveries with Burger King at first, but we had to stop because the authorities would not let us. Our delivery men were arrested by the police, etc. It was not fast enough and we were losing more money than we were making. However, Carrefour has just signed an agreement with Jumia for online purchase and home delivery.</p><h4>What is the strategy of the group for the upcoming year at this point?</h4><p>We started 2020 really well for all of the subsidiaries, including Burger King, Virgin, Kiabi, and Carrefour. Most likely, Carrefour will come out of it and have a good year. For the others, if the situation improves by the end of April, we still expect a positive year. If it lasts longer, we will have to revise our accounts in order to estimate the losses we will suffer by the end of the year. There are also government aids, deadline extensions, and so on. A great deal of assistance has been put in place for struggling or closed companies. We will try to rely on those to at least balance the accounts of the subsidiaries that are being closed by the end of the year. Carrefour also supports the national effort by contributing MAD50 million to the Moroccan COVID-19 fund.</p><h4>Can the unusual growth of Carrefour compared to previous years absorb loss from other subsidiaries?</h4><p>As a holding company, we are not directly impacted by the operational part. It will be a dividend issue. In other words, what dividends can we draw from Label'Vie and possibly re-inject into other struggling subsidiaries? The question will arise in these terms. As I told you, we hope to at least balance other subsidiaries. Ultimately, as a holding company, we hope to draw dividends from Carrefour and Label'Vie without being forced to inject into the other subsidiaries. You have to put into perspective the good year that Carrefour is going to have for the two reasons I mentioned to you. Firstly, this growth relies on a constant perimeter basis, but there is little to no development outside. As I explained to you, the store openings are slackened off. This will compensate for that. The overall growth over the year will not be enormous. Our 50 million dirhams donation will add to the year's results. At Label'Vie level for 2020, we hope to be within our forecasts. If we are within our budgets, we will be very happy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently opened operations in Ivory Coast with two of your flagship corporations. What is the strategy of the group regarding Africa?</h4><p>We had a strategic expansion plan at the national level that was based on a five-year plan focused on basic trade. We decided to continue our expansion on the international level by becoming an example at the national level to prepare ourselves for this sub-Saharan adventure. In 2019, the time came when we decided to create two branches in Ivory Coast as part of our expansion plan. We have also confirmed our presence in Morocco as a model to follow in the construction industry, particularly in prefabricated, ready-mixed concrete, transport, and other activities that allow us to have a strong business model in Morocco. The idea is to adapt this model to seize more opportunities at the sub-Saharan level, starting with Ivory Coast, which will be Menara's hub. Our ambition is, therefore, to be present in Ivory Coast through our core business, which is the installation of prefabricated factories and all that is quarrying, with our other complementary activities already present in the group. Sub-Saharan Africa and Africa in general is an economic market that has a great orientation at the international level, so there are opportunities. We also consider our connections to the royal policy, so there are several advantages and several things that have facilitated this integration. Africa has a strong potential, especially for the sector in which we operate.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the outcome of the group's 2016-20 strategic vision?</h4><p>The balance sheet in general is a positive one. We set an objective to be the national benchmark in our core businesses, and we are currently the national benchmark in terms of capacity, presence, and turnover. In the vision were several structuring investment projects that have achieved 90% of their objectives in terms of achievement. The loss of our founder had an impact at the beginning, but we were able to preserve continuity and put in place a succession that was worked out well in advance, thanks to the clear-sightedness of the president. Transmission is the decisive element for the continuity of a group or a family company in general at the international level, particularly in Morocco. Currently, we are in the process of consolidating this plan by 2020, as there is another road to travel throughout the year. But generally, despite the construction sector's poor growth, the group has been able to achieve growth. This is important for us because the ecosystem of construction and building since 2016 has been stagnant, particularly in the region of Marrakech. We have grown over 25% approximately during this time.</p><h4>What are the group's main strategic objectives for the next five years?</h4><p>Our objectives lie on two main axes: one axis is the preparation that has been finalized for a possible IPO of the group's main branch, Menara Prefa. The second axis is an official and operational presence in sub-Saharan Africa through two boxes: the launching of building works and the starting up and implementation of the factories. In addition, we also have the ambition to be present in other regions at the national level to follow the evolution of other regions in terms of development. For example, this could be in the southern region, other central regions, and in the north; this represents continuity for us because we consider the construction sector is among the top levers at the national level and will certainly be evolving. With this 2021-2025 vision, it is vital for us that if we want to maintain our position as leaders, we must always innovate and reposition ourselves on the market through innovation as an integrated solution, not only as product innovations but also service, quality, digital, human, financial, and process innovation.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the building and public works (BTP) sector in Morocco? What are the challenges that the group is facing?</h4><p>Unfortunately, in the construction sector, there are some risks. Some work is being done at the moment, but it remains among the sectors that are under-supervised. There is also the informal sector, which brings in unfair competition. Investing in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and innovation is still a huge cost for the group, and not all operators have the same spirit. But I remain optimistic because there are projects that are open in the Agadir region, and there is an orientation and a willingness to structure and develop this sector. At the level of the sector, there are many things to be foreseen, such as training, fairer taxation, and an accompaniment on behalf of interested people for companies to try to upgrade these structures. We share this ambition with other companies in the sector that have the same objectives and the same orientation in terms of fair competition and development, because it is through these values that Morocco can climb the ladder and evolve.</p><h4>Menara Prefa represents 70% of the group. Are you thinking to keep this business as the main line for the group or are you looking into more diversification?</h4><p>At the moment, we will stay the way we are. Menara Prefa is the locomotive; it is the flagship company of the group and, in terms of strategic evolution, we are strategically integrating all innovation in Menara Prefa. While it represents 70% of the holding, it is the main axis around which all the other branches satellite around. There is another pole we are developing in real estate, but, for the moment, Menara Prefa will remain the locomotive. We will maintain this position because the development in terms of products, services, and solutions is done under the umbrella of Menara Prefa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the idea behind the venture come about three years ago?</h4><p>We started this project with a deep knowledge of how the traditional IT business in Spain was running. Personally, I was involved in the first Spanish company listed on NASDAQ in 2003. Since then, we have been developing IT in Spain via the traditional model, which means outsourcing the IT infrastructure and platforms of big customers and companies, though that is changing in a dramatic way. Now, the scope of services and what customers are demanding are completely different. During the financial crisis, Spanish companies completely froze their IT investment, and they have had the same platforms since 2011. Following the crisis, there was a huge opportunity to change the systems, platforms, and applications. Now, the idea is that one does not need to make a big investment on CAPEX to build their platform because cloud technology allows them to have the best and most innovative services while only paying for what they use. In 2016, we decided to move from being a traditional player to building a new way of doing things, which is the reason why we decided to start this cloud venture.</p><h4>How did the company become a leader in the cloud migration technology in such a short period of time?</h4><p>First, it is a matter of bringing the right people to the team, and once we had that we gave them the best training and tools to develop themselves and have the opportunity to change and innovate with complete freedom. Second, we use the best technology and provide the best training for the team. Our approach depends on providing customers full flexibility to adapt to their real needs. This is something that traditional players are not in the position to develop.</p><h4>What sectors are most important in the breakdown of your client base?</h4><p>We provide services to every single sector, although some sectors are more interesting than others because of the culture and circumstance. For example, banking is fairly traditional today, and it is fairly difficult to find a slot to start developing cloud services in banking; however, now we start to see that new cloud services can provide many solutions. The cloud brings the opportunity to manage a great deal of information that is otherwise difficult to manage. We have seen traditional markets moving to the cloud extremely rapidly, while others are starting with it. New companies seem to have been working all their lives with cloud services, and therefore it is fairly easy to develop new functionalities to bring new ways of doing things for their business.</p><h4>How do you ensure that a company's business migrates successfully in a safe and efficient manner?</h4><p>When one moves to the cloud, everything is more secure than what they have on the premises or in a traditional data center, although convincing people of this has proved challenging. Everything is completely tracked on the cloud and does not depend on people managing the platform. Secondly, large sums of money have been invested in protecting that infrastructure and platform, much more than any single customer might invest. We can protect and secure that for our customers because we follow all the best practices related to the ISOs. From the beginning, we decided to move to the ISO 20000 for service management and ISO 22301 related to business continuity and finally ISO 27001.</p><h4>Enimbos was named one of the top 10 innovative ICT disruptors in 2019. What does winning awards mean to the company?</h4><p>It is significant because we invest large sums of money here, and from the beginning we decided we wanted to be a well-known cloud company providing managed services for the cloud. There is a second horizon related to innovation, where we have been investing in our own software as a service platform with which we will take the next step and grow outside of Spain. In such platforms, there are many players in the US and some in the UK, though no others in Europe. When we look at the players around, we are the only ones with a competitive platform with which to automate and save, in order to use spot instances in the multi-cloud environment. It is therefore extremely important to be recognized as one of the top companies in this regard.</p><h4>Which other regions are you interested in?</h4><p>Portugal is the first step for growing and an important step for us because we can test what we can deliver. It is also a fantastic environment for providing services to English and French-speaking people. The idea is starting with business development and creating a new cell for customer care to move forward, first to the UK and then to the north of Europe. We are focusing mainly on European markets, though we received the first order from Brazil in May. We are not ready to take the step into Latin America, as it is not only extremely expensive but also the market is not mature as it is in Europe. We work where we see an opportunity to add value, like in Malta, where we provide the full public transport system platform. Tactically, we will do things when a project is interesting, though our strategy is to develop the north of Europe and the UK.</p><h4>What do you consider the main trends in the ICT industry?</h4><p>There are some areas of the sector that are not growing, such as hardware and the reselling of software. Also, the professional service of outsourcing people to customers is no longer growing, as this is more related to the traditional way of doing things. Growth is happening in the movement to cloud technology and will be much higher than 20% per year. Cloud providers are doubling their numbers year after year, so it is a different market opportunity. In Spain, in the ICT market the first trend is related to the change to the cloud, which is on the agenda of every CEO of a big company. The second is securing the environment so that the cloud can be easily managed, and third is data analytics, using the data coming from the systems and different platforms and being able to easily make decisions.</p><h4>What are your objectives for Enimbos for 2019?</h4><p>Everything is related to growth. On average, we are awarded 78% of projects, which means we have a high level of success in the market that we want to maintain. I want to be successful with the right awareness in the market. We are investing in new business development people to join the team. The second objective is to have the service platform fully ready and sold in the market. It is something we are using today though it lacks some of the developments we need to have a fully automated reselling of the platform. The third goal is more internal, as we are willing to continue to create a different culture in the market to have people fully involved in the company. One area of interest is to collaborate on projects with social responsibility. This is important for us, as it is important to our team.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Mexico for Chiesi's overall business strategy?</h4><p>Mexico is one of the most important countries in Latin America for Chiesi in terms of potential and evolution of the market and environment. Mexico can be a great opportunity for Chiesi Group. We started in Mexico almost seven years ago, and our portfolio in the respiratory line is now complete, including several products mainly for asthma and COPD.</p><h4>What are the main opportunities in the local health market?</h4><p>The key opportunities are bringing innovative products into the market. Many products have been approved by US or EU medical authorities. They are innovative products that can truly change the lives of patients, including new combinations of existing drugs as new formulations. Chiesi can contribute to improving the Mexican healthcare system by being listed among government institutions, while also working with private markets to increase coverage and to reach the highest number of patients. Rare diseases also represent a recent strategy for Chiesi Group. Chiesi made several acquisitions of companies over the last seven years in order to establish this pillar. Many of these programs are approved and are on the European market. In Mexico, we need to conclude our regulatory exercises with COFEPRIS in order to finalize the registration in Mexico and hopefully to bring in rare disease products. Unfortunately, every country has its own regulatory flaws, and the new procedures in Mexico could take months or years to develop.</p><h4>What kinds of rare diseases is Chiesi focusing on?</h4><p>We have several products for diseases that are unfortunately not well known and, therefore, do not have any treatment options available in the market right now. By working on rare diseases, we want to improve and save the lives of patients all around the world. The key aspect of our business is figuring out how to help institutional payers to reimburse these treatments.</p><h4>What is your perception of the health regulatory system, and how can it be more efficient?</h4><p>We are in a kind of transition year right now, between the old government institutions and the new ones. Many things have changed in the last nine months. The new government had many ideas on how to reform or restructure healthcare. We need to have a new panel of stakeholders in COFEPRIS, as well as in the key governmental institutions. But the situation is still in progress. We do not have the final picture yet. Many changes have been necessary. COFEPRIS is an internationally recognized institution, with peculiar agreements with American, Japanese, and European FDA. This is an advantage because, in many cases, it allows us a regulatory fast track for innovative products already approved in Europe or the US. In terms of changes in the way the government is buying products, this is becoming more complicated than in the past. We need more experience and time to understand the new dynamics, which are moving in the direction of having a more transparent system with fewer complicated procedures. Pharmaceutical companies have a significantly higher level of exposure than in the past complicated by day-to-day work, tenders, distribution, and collection of credit. If you cannot collect cash, it will hurt your business.</p><h4>What is the breakdown of your business between the public and private sectors?</h4><p>Chiesi Mexico does almost 70% of its business with governmental institutions. Amid the changes happening in the government procurement processes and the delays in tender publications, we are trying to involve ourselves in the new dynamics. It is more complicated than in the past to be involved. The risks can be much higher now, so the companies will have to revise internal procedures and flows to comply with new tender relations.</p><h4>How is the government's prioritization of social needs affecting Chiesi in Mexico?</h4><p>What we can comment on is the way access is generated now, which is expected to be different than in the past, with the deceleration of the universal healthcare system. This is something that still needs to change. The universalization of the healthcare system is not yet there. The provision of social security to 20 million uninsured Mexicans is not yet there. There are still processes to go through. It is going to be a long reform. We have a long way to go still. However, there has been a change in procurement activities and the way the government buys from pharma companies. We do not have an impact from prioritization, but we are affected by the way products are required. For example, the new law is centralizing procurement by the government, which means someone else has to take care of distribution. In a big country like Mexico, special logistics are needed to bring a product from one point of the country to another. This is not easy, and there are specialized distributors with the know-how and logistics instruments to do that. The next logistics flow expected by the new procurement procedures does not include all these unique elements to the industry.</p><h4>Why did Chiesi launch its triple treatment therapy for COPD first in Mexico?</h4><p>We had the honor of launching TRIMBOW® in Mexico for the first time outside Europe thanks to COFEPRIS agreement with the European Medicines Authority (EMA). The product, already approved by EMA, was immediately recognized by COFEPRIS, which allowed us to complete all regulations in a timely fashion. It has been a benefit for Mexican scientific community but, moreover, for patients. If you suffer from a common but severe disease like COPD and you are not satisfied by existing drugs, you want a new product to be available as soon as possible.</p><h4>What new products and services are you planning to launch in Mexico in the coming months?</h4><p>We will launch the first of our rare disease products, after sorting out the regulatory procedures. This will be the first milestone for Chiesi Mexico in rare disease and will hopefully be the first of a long series of launches over the coming years. We want to make our products available where they were not previously available. Mexico is a complicated country in terms of patient access to medicines. We hope to work together with the government to develop sustainable access models. I wish for the new government to understand the real concept of buying pharmaceutical products. The cost of treating a patient using the most innovative products in the world may sometimes be more expensive but can help the total cost of treatment. All in all, it is a completely new approach based on patient's benefit: the real savings for institutions comes after getting a complete view of the entire treatment cost.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Are there any plans for maintaining growth and increasing the company's market share?</h4><p>Market shares are not really the objective; our aim is to be the best IT company and provide high-quality professional services for businesses. Of course, we also want to be treated as an elite company, especially with so many different competitors within the global market. Plus, as a system integrator, there is tough competition in all the fields we work in. So, the goal for now is to focus on doing our best for our clients.</p><h4>Do you think SBM has certain strategies or projects in place that makes the company stand out from new market players?</h4><p>We are proud of the fact that the quality and nature of our services has convinced some customers to break their relationships with some of our competitors. At present, our client base involves more than 250 customers from all over the Kingdom from various fields, such as SMEs, oil and gas, financials, banking, petrochemicals, and governmental. To cater to more businesses, we are introducing Cyber Security, Analytics, and AI and we've also developed our own digital hub. At the same time, the focus still remains on being the best in the services we offer.</p><h4>Can you shed light on some market trends as well as growth while functioning in the private sector?</h4><p>Most of the business in Saudi Arabia either comes from the government directly, or it passes through the government in one way or the other. So, regardless of the type, every business is either indirectly or directly touched by the government. And while the banking and financial and commercial sectors seem somewhat untouched from the government, they do follow the guidelines set by it. With Saudi Vision 2030 now into play, companies like SBM now have the chance to develop and provide improved services. Previously, when the market was shaken, it came as a benefit to firms like SBM. Stable companies could handle the uncertainty in a better manner than new players or shakier firms in the field. So, the market filtered out on its own, leaving behind only the best companies.</p><h4>In your opinion, which sectors in Saudi Arabia have the highest potential for your services?</h4><p>We find the banking sector crucial as mobile services can really boost the entire financial sector. Some new projects introduced by the government like the Red Sea Project will need major infrastructure development. There is also great potential in the cloud and even international companies are opening data centers. SBM also provides the cloud service and there's definitely major growth in this area. With such services deployed, financial companies as well as the government can really lead in the future.                                        </p><h4>Are you working on partnering up with international companies?</h4><p>Our main focus is the local market in Saudi, but we are proud of our ties with IBM and we constantly innovate on this relationship to make it bigger and better. We are also looking into partnering with Russian companies. We've already signed an agreement with the Minister of Communication and Information Technology that allows us to be the focal point of Russian IT firms that come to the Kingdom. We've also signed agreements with British companies during their visit and we've met with Australian companies that can offer niche services to the market. And of course, we work with US companies too, including Microsoft, Oracle, and IBM. We take pride in all the relationships that we have established. As a system integrator, we can provide custom-designed packages that provide value to our customers, and providing the most customized solution instead of a one-size-fits-all is our core value.</p><h4>How does SBM ensure that new transfers truly understand the economy of the Kingdom?</h4><p>We start off with the selection of employees and go all the way to training and professional development. Our system is designed such that employees follow the lead of their superiors and it also ensures that they are integrated into the company culture completely. Right at the start, we aim to provide our employees with all that can later translate into sustained development not only for themselves, but also for our company and clients. SBM serves as a great platform for developing clients and both Saudi firms and international companies are interested in hiring those employees. SBM is also a part of a large group involving over 25 companies and has joint ventures with some of the world's leading brands. With such support backing us up, it becomes easier to be one of the best firms in the country and it also gives us the financial depth we need in the market.</p><h4>If not market share, then what is more important to SBM?</h4><p>As a system integrator, I don't want to deal only with software or hardware; I like being challenged, and the solution is what is the most important. Our focus is on having the proficiencies and skills that can help us come up with the most effective solutions and that is also the key to maximizing different measures of financial success, such as market share. Essentially, we should focus on providing the highest-quality solutions and that will lead to market share. We want to be the best in the field and our technical knowledge, experience, and reputation will allow us to develop not only the sector we work in but also the economy both indirectly or directly.</p><h4>Now that Saudi Arabia is on the path of becoming a regional leader in both IT and digitalization, what is your vision and growth expectation of SBM for the next few years?</h4><p>The foremost priority is ensuring that the company is stable, and this is one of the advantages of not being listed on the stock market. It is essential to have well-balanced growth; if there's too much focus on growth, then that can lead to one losing or imploding control. It is difficult to just keep chasing numbers these days. Too many aspects of the market are not in our hand when it comes to making informed growth expectations. Economic and political issues, such as the global pandemic we're currently seeing will control and determine many business aspects. But it all comes down to the fact that if you focus on offering the best services, then at the end of the year, you will see that you have grown. At the end, we need to be a healthy and viable business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunity has COVID-19 presented to MIS and the Saudi IT sector?</h4><p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, MIS invested heavily in its infrastructure to become an agile company and prepared business continuity plans. We did not experience issues when we started working remotely because we had already instilled it in the DNA of the company. We helped many of our customers build secure infrastructure and designed solutions to help them adjust to the new reality forced by the pandemic. One example of that was when MIS was selected as the technology systems integrator for the G20 Virtual Summit project; a project we carried out successfully in a demanding environment and a short amount of time.</p><h4>What are your plans to generate more profit than the SAR76-million net profit recorded in 2019?</h4><p>MIS is in a continuous journey of transformation to its portfolio of products and services and to its operations with the fundamental goal of growth in revenues and profits. We strongly believe in the Saudi market as demand for IT solutions and infrastructure are essential to enable the Kingdom to realize its aspiring Vision 2030. MIS is expanding its horizontal and vertical solutions, offering to cover more elements of the IT value chain. In addition, we always look for ways to leverage our resources better, reduce operational cost and enhance customer experience. We are defining MIS 3.0 with core theme to work on positioning “Saudi as a Digital Experience" (SaDX). We had an ambitious plan for 2020 based on our deep analysis of market opportunities, government and industry directions, and internal capabilities. We then adjusted the plan to reflect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lower oil prices, but overall, we see positive outcomes for many elements of our plan.</p><h4>What services have you offered in this time of uncertain-ty to ensure business continuity and support the economy?</h4><p>We have assured all of our clients we are there for them and will go the extra mile should any unforeseen circumstances affect their businesses. For our employees, we provided assurances that our priority is their safety and wellbeing. We want to ensure we meet both our customer and em-ployee satisfaction, as you cannot look after one and compromise the other. It is all about ensuring everyone can still conduct their tasks in the new normal. We have many critical projects to enable virtual meetings, remote and secure access to in-formation with mobility and high availability.</p><h4>You have created a Dr. Robot project with the Ministry of Health to target haj visitors. Can you tell us more about how that project is going?</h4><p>Dr. Robot and all the other telemedicine devices we invested in are US- and Saudi FDA-certified and designed to be used in hospitals for medical diagnosis and patient follow-ups. The devices help doctors conduct medical checks on patients remotely and even read and check vital signs and reports. Our goal is to localize this technology in the Kingdom in terms of manufacturing and software development.</p><h4>What has COVID-19 taught you about your business and about managing a crisis?</h4><p>We base MIS values on a Principles Trio, which we always thrive to create a balance across; share-holders' value, employee well-being, and customer satisfaction. We maintain a prime level of internal communication to ensure we inform all employees about developments in a timely fashion. For companies like MIS, where the key asset is people and skills, it is imperative to keep the staff loyal and motivated. The culture we adopt in our company and the incredible level of trust we share have motivated our employees. They adapted extremely well to the new operating model, because of the tools that eased the shift from employee-dependent working station to a remote one, such as Microsoft Teams. This crisis has taught us to always expect the unexpected. Our company has proven its resilience against unforeseen challenges by entirely adapting to the new operating model and help our customers do the same.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Spain’s recovery post COVID-19]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[manuel-muniz-secretary-of-state-global-spain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Secretary of State of Global Spain, part of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation, works to boost the country's reputation in several areas. What have been the main lines of work since you took office in January?</h4><p>There have been three main lines of work since I took over in January. The first has been everything regarding the national and foreign strategies in times of COVID-19 as well as post-COVID-19. I was heavily involved in the working group that produced Spain's exit strategy from the lockdown and I was a member of the expert group that advised the Prime Minister, the government, and the cabinet on the steps to take to end the lockdown. The reason I was integral was because we set up the COVID-19 International Observatory, where we obtained information from our embassies regarding what other places around the world were doing to end their COVID-19 lockdowns. We instilled the best practices and ensured they were present in Spain's exit strategy. The second part had to do with the repatriation and return efforts led by the ministry during the pandemic, as Spain underwent the largest repatriation effort in its history. The ministry was directly or indirectly involved in the operation to bring back approximately 40,000 citizens from around the world. More returned through regular commercial operations, but those 40,000 returned via flights that we organized or they used the European Civil Protection Mechanism to bring them back. The third part of my work, which happened much more on the later end of the crisis, is on economic diplomacy and how we crafted a strategy both in Europe together with other colleagues in the ministry and the Prime Minister's Office, how we set up the right reconstruction fund at the European level, and how that connects to our national efforts in terms of fostering internationalization and our economic expansion abroad. This part has been focused on recovery.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 affected the image and reputation of Spain abroad?</h4><p>The latest figures that we have are from a survey done by Red Track on country reputation. It was undertaken during the peak of the crisis in Spain between early March and mid-April. The results are striking, as Spain's image didn't take a significant hit. We are still perceived as a reliable country with resilient institutions and a worthy culture that is extremely attractive for tourism. Our lifestyle is highly valued and appreciated throughout the world. A country's reputation is much more resilient long term than what people think and is far less affected by timely issues such as the effects of COVID-19 on a particular country at a particular time. The pandemic is unfortunately a global phenomenon, and we tend to make snapshot evaluations of something that is dynamic, which is a mistake. This has affected other countries greatly, and hence our assessment of where countries are and how their image was impacted must also be dynamic. When you look at this objectively, you realize this is affecting some of the most capable countries around the world with some of the best healthcare systems, which have been more affected than Spain. Overall, the specific impact on our image abroad is much diminished, which is what the quantitative data shows.</p><h4>Global Spain has been working on several initiatives to mitigate the impact of the pandemic. How have been the results of the Spain For Sure social media campaign?</h4><p>It was a positive campaign launched at the right time with a message of safety and security in a country that had made an enormous effort to contain one of the worse epidemiological curves in the world. The format is interesting, as it was a partnership with the private sector, with Global Spain on the public side in addition to the tourism and commerce ministries and the Prime Minister's Office. Once the campaign was produced, we distributed it via our ministries, embassies, and ambassadors as well as around 3,000-4,000 businesses and business associations. This had a huge reach and was granular in its impact, reaching specific geographies and collectives that would not otherwise have been touched. That is a product of a PPP and demonstrates how much can be done when businesses are aligned with the government and vice versa. Our common goal was to leave this terrible phase of the pandemic behind, and it is time to show we will do this together.</p><h4>What is your vision of the post-COVID-19 world?</h4><p>We conducted a number of foresight studies at the beginning of the crisis to understand the impact on global economics, global governance, and the EU. The conclusion was that the crisis would accelerate prior trends of transformation. It would not slow them down or create major new trends but would serve as an accelerator of prior works. However, if not managed properly, the pandemic will accelerate social fractures, as it will unequally impact certain groups in our societies. It would have a larger impact on particularly fragile portions of our population, such as those who are precariously employed, as about two-thirds of the jobs displaced in Spain because of COVID-19 were short term and unpredictable. It also impacts vulnerable populations, such as the elderly living by themselves or single-parent or low-income households with no access to technology to keep up with online educational programs. We were heavily conscious of this in Spain, and during the entire exit strategy process we had people who looked exclusively at the social dimension of the measures being taken and implemented. Another trend that might accelerate is that of deglobalization, as the crisis poses a challenge to countries that were already suffering supply chain problems before the crisis began. For example, we had challenges importing protective equipment and health equipment like respirators. We have launched an initiative at the European level to have a healthier debate about how we produce autonomy without undoing the global trading regime. The crisis has also exacerbated the US-China conflict and has added a healthcare dimension, with the US leaving WHO as a consequence. We have to prepare how Spain adapts to these issues and address them globally.</p><h4>What are the main goals and priorities of Global Spain for the coming years?</h4><p>There are two main goals, with the first having to do with strategy and strategic thinking to address the challenges of a rapidly shifting international landscape and how we reverse the erosion of the multilateral and international order, such as the World Trading Organization (WTO), the UN ecosystem, and many others. The second piece will be economic diplomacy. We will focus heavily on this area to ensure our integrated global economy stands strong and that we continue to foster international trade. For us, the rest of 2020 and 2021 will be focused on getting the EU Mercosur trade agreement agreed and ratified, supporting the internationalization of our businesses, and advancing the agenda of reform and investment through the use of the European fund. At the end of 2020, we have to present to the European Commission an investment plan with all the projects that we seek to put forward with European funding in order to generate employment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the impact of COVID-19 on Panama's logistics and transportation sector?</h4><p><span></span>Our numbers for container traffic in 1H2020 were better than in 2019, but we started to see a slowdown in June, with some of the lines not serving calls they were planning for a few weeks. When we look at the impact on our main business, which is transshipment of containers, we are looking at a 4% decline for the year. The reason we have not been impacted relative to other ports that had 10 to 20% declines is because many of the lines that were making direct calls to certain countries did not make sense for the amount of business they had to make all those direct calls. It was a cost cutting optimization for them to dump or leave it at a hub and use smaller feeder vessels or less frequent callings to other ports. We, therefore, have not suffered as bad as a transshipment hub but our revenue has declined significantly because our local cargo has declined by about 40%.</p><h4>What effects of the current pandemic do you believe will be part of a longer-term trend, outlasting the pandemic itself?</h4><p><span></span>On the transshipment side, we are feeling an impact not only from the coronavirus but also the US-China trade war. As a result, a lot of countries are looking at regionalization. This means a major hub for transshipment like Panama should benefit in the next three to five years. As for the local cargo business, it will take at least another one to two years before we can get back to pre-COVID levels. I do not think this will happen next year but perhaps in 2022 we will get to 2019 levels for local consumption and imported goods. A lot of companies have approached us because we are building a high-tech warehouse inside our Pacific port of Balboa. It will be the first high-spec modern warehouse inside a port in Panama. We are doing a pilot project starting this August and it has already attracted a lot of interest. During the pandemic, a lot of companies have looked to store cars and products here instead of sending them to Colombia or Brazil. I think this push will continue in the near future. The government has recognized Panama's potential as a hub for DCs or other types of facilities. This will strengthen Panama's role as a port hub in the mid to long term.</p><h4>How do you see Panama maintaining its role as a logistics hub, particularly for transshipment, versus other regional competitors with similar ambitions and government initiatives?</h4><p><span></span>Two major competitive advantages that Panama has over regional competitors such as Jamaica and the Dominican Republic are a key strategic location and the canal. Panama has been a regional hub for Central America for a long time, and over this time the local workforce has developed a skill set. The Dominican Republic has a good cost base and lots of space, so it is a strong competitor, but Panama has other competitive advantages to offer. Government policies will play an important role in the future. In Panama, the government is pro-business as its wants to see the country realize its potential as a regional logistics hub. They have already developed some economic policies to support this hub status to encourage companies like Walmart to set up here. Whether implementation happens or not is a question because Panama has one of the highest labor cost in the region. </p><h4>What are some of the biggest operational challenges you have had to face due to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p><span></span>It has been a challenge that has actually brought everyone together as a team. Until early June, all my department heads and I had daily calls as we had to constantly implement new directions from the government. Unfortunately, we had close to 200 confirmed cases in our two ports. 80 these were from our staff and the rest were government employees and contractors. The virus has had a major financial impact on our business. We spent around USD1 million extra already on Covid-related expenses and expect to spend around USD2 million overall  by the end of 2020, excluding overtime. We always strive to be one step ahead of the government. For example, we are implementing thermal cameras at the ports. My next focus is a pilot project to see how we can do facial recognition for people to clock and be linked to payroll instead of people using biometrics or a card. We are trying to make our business as contactless as possible. This will help us stay ahead of the market. We have not had any work stoppages as many of the ports in the region have had because we have been constantly having bi-weekly or weekly open forums with the staff. Communication and transparency has allowed us to avoid work stoppages or major internal issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of Haider Holding?</h4><p>My grandfather's father started trading with main food items like rice, sugar, and dates. After he died, his son came to stay with his cousins in Doha and set up a business for basic food items. When we started the company, we were in three lines of work: real estate, the share market, and foreign investment. In 2008, Uncle Ali Hassan Salman Al Hadi, CEO of the Haider Holding Group of Companies, who is Bahraini, started laying the foundation for this group and developing and improving the performance of all the companies in the group.</p><h4>What was the reason behind establishing such a complete holding?</h4><p>The Amir has said that in 10 years, oil and gas must not be the main source of income for the country, as we need other things such as education, sport, and tourism. That is why we are not working in just one sector. When it comes to the balance sheet, we want it to be diversified. We need to be sure about any new services, show the market that it needs them, and most importantly that it adds value to our company. All the companies in our group help each other for this reason. The real estate sector is one of the biggest in our company. We have the Al Sultan Beach Resort, many villas, and several compounds. We have two towers namely Al Jumaira Tower and Al Sultan Tower, which is now one of the oldest in Qatar built in 1981. We brought it under Haider Holding in the last 10 years and it's for lease in the market. We also have Mesopotamia, our contracting company. In the same sector, we have Manzil Al Sultan Carpentry. We can custom build anything for homes and offices. We also have Al Qatariya, one of our companies responsible for real estate management. We are doing work for companies such as Sidra and Qatar Airways.</p><h4>What other sectors are you present in?</h4><p>The second sector is the food sector. Today, we are the oldest agent for American brands of cigarettes such as Camel and Winston. JTI is a company that started at the end of the 1950s, and we are its oldest agent and have a good share in Qatar. My uncle had a vision to make of us one of the top 10 companies in the food sector and started a hypermarket similar to Carrefour under the name Uncle Ali Market. We have opened our third branch. I used his name and picture as I want everyone in Qatar to know that he is the reason for our success. Food security is an important sector for the government because of the blockade. My uncle built a strong asset for the food sector as he wanted it to be strong in the future. And we became partners with the Ministry of Economy and the Chamber of Commerce. This is a big responsibility and if there are any mistakes, we directly have to face the prime minister who works by himself to solve all matters.</p><h4>Which other new sectors could Haider Holding enter in the future?</h4><p><span></span>This is exactly what we are working on now. My uncle is the brain behind this company and wants to take us international. We are currently in the food sector in Pakistan and Jordan, and in the future we will be in more countries. We wait for opportunities. We have entered Oman's real estate sector, as we have shops and factories there, and the second step is to enter another sector. We also have many opportunities in Turkey and the Sultanate of Oman, as the market is for real estate and retail is massive. Now is the time for us to work internationally. The most important sectors currently are education and health, and we have not gotten into these sectors to date. In the last few years, my uncle has conducted many studies to enter these two sectors. We are in negotiation with one of the biggest British schools. This would be beneficial to both us and the school as we could do something amazing if we come to an agreement. We would do something that would become a landmark in Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you navigate the initial days of this crisis and adjust your internal systems?</h4><p><span></span>Because we are a bank, we were fortunate in the sense that, as required of all banks, we had contingency plans in place. Banks have what we call disaster recovery, offsite work, because they are expected to stay open no matter what. That gave us a bit of a running start. We knew we needed to be “business as usual" as much as possible. We assembled a taskforce, headed by the CEO of the bank, that met daily, at the beginning twice a day. We were able to go from 100% onsite to less than 30% within four days. I commend the executive leadership for pulling it off. The business remained intact, and people were engaged and productive. While we were disrupted temporarily, the core businesses of investment banking, commercial banking, corporate banking, and treasury were all completely up and running.</p><h4>Have you readjusted liabilities or investment positions in response to the crisis?</h4><p><span></span>We have not adjusted liabilities at all because we have not had liquidity issues thanks to the central bank's proactive programs mitigating the impact on businesses and banks' liquidity. On the asset side, the situation is different. In March, in particular, markets became disconnected. At the point in time, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) became significantly higher than Saudi Interbank Offered Rate (SIBOR), which is a historical anomaly. Our treasury spent a large amount of time managing these anomalies and disconnects in the market. There was negligible adjustment on the liability side and significant adjustment on the asset side.</p><h4>What do you anticipate persisting beyond the crisis in terms of digitalization?</h4><p><span></span>A crisis does not just force companies to adopt certain changes to their new business model—it also accelerates it. What typically takes six to eight years to adopt is now 12-18 months. Without a doubt, it is imperative to make a client feel like they can do anything they want without coming in, without a decline in the quality of service and delivery, and that the user experience is comfortable for them. These three imperatives have been elevated in importance tremendously. We, as a bank, are spending much more time trying to figure out how to accelerate and enhance the delivery of virtual channels to achieve these three objectives.</p><h4>What do you expect going forward in terms of profitability and performance?</h4><p><span></span>We have three headwinds that we have to deal with. The most measurable one is falling interest rates. Everyone knows Saudi banks enjoy a high proportion of non-interest-bearing deposits in the banking system. That is the first significant headwind. Headwind number two is the expected decline in economic activity because of the economic climate and, therefore, the decline in demand for consumer, credit card, and even corporate loans. We obviously made projections and have adjusted our budgets and plans accordingly. The third one is NPLS and that one, you never know until it happens. We have started, at Samba, for 1Q2020 and 2Q2020, taking additional provisions. We have coordinated to our risk management and gave them more leeway in taking general provisions in anticipation potential negative credit event. </p><h4>How are you planning for the various recovery scenarios from COVID-19?</h4><p><span></span>The whole world, Saudi Arabia included, worked hard to flatten the curve and better prepare the health systems and infrastructure in anticipation of COVID-19. We have done a tremendous job in Saudi Arabia to get the healthcare system prepared for a number of cases that is significantly higher than what we could have dealt in three months ago. The whole ecosystem has now been prepared for this. The likelihood of another shutdown is remote. On the economic side, whether there is a second Covid wave or not, the economic and business challenges that we have to live with are indeed real. At the bank, we have planned accordingly, as the full economic consequences might not fully materialize be apparent for a while longer.</p><h4>What have you as a leader, and as an organization, learned from this unprecedented and historic crisis?</h4><p><span></span>My biggest lesson has been to apply the ideas behind the five stages of grief and then disseminate them throughout the organization. When people talk about agility in management, it is about going through the five phases of grief and bringing your leadership with you. The crisis management team meets daily just to take care of health and similar issues. The senior leadership of the bank has met almost on a weekly basis to discuss and contemplate how the changing landscape affects our business model and prospects. We have had a board meeting to discuss how this affects our plan for this year and the following years. When there is such a huge adverse situation, you have to embrace it and adapt accordingly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CEAPI, with more than 140 members, was founded in 2014 with the goal of strengthening the Ibero-American connection and the business climate. What have been its main accomplishments in the last six years?</h4><p><span></span>I always think that the things that work do so, because they bring about something that is necessary and responds to a preexisting reality. Spain does not just invest in Latin America; Latin America has begun looking to Spain with an increasing interest. For one, this space allows for the relationship between presidents and helps create relationships of trust. I believe that there are other factors that have contributed to the success of CEAPI. This includes the special attention that we have given, since the beginning, to all other aspects that accompany business life such as all aspects of social commitment, the environment, the role of women in business, as well as the role of the youth.</p><h4>What impact has the pandemic had on relations between Latin America and Spain?</h4><p><span></span>The fact that Spain does well is key for those companies that not only have headquarters in our country but also are investors in Latin America. We are talking about a flow of EUR130-150 million. Also, over the last few years, Latin America, with Mexico at the forefront, has been become one of the largest investors in Europe, with Spain as the landing point. When Spain is doing well, it is beneficial for both Spain and Latin America.</p><h4>What has been CEAPI's main priority since the beginning of the pandemic?</h4><p><span></span>When the pandemic arrived, the whole world, namely governments, businesses, and health organizations, were overwhelmed by the situation. There was a great deal of stress, exhaustion, and the need to make decisions rapidly, and the response has been spectacular. Over the course of 24 days, from one day to the next, companies made decisions and prepared themselves. At this level of stress and urgency, our priority was being able to exchange experiences. We had several meetings, first in Spain with participants from various Latin American countries to exchange experiences, to show what people were doing in different sectors to react. The second aspect that has stood out in the business world during this pandemic was social responsibility and how businesses were able to support, help in terms of demonstrating solidarity or in terms of productive capacity, namely producing masks or other sanitary products. It was important to share so that we could all be proud and set examples for each other. The third aspect is that when we talk about public-private collaboration, we often think about building a highway or some other physical project. I think the greatest potential for public-private collaboration during this crisis relates to ideas. What characterizes business is its capacity to respond quickly, its flexibility, its resilience, and its vision for the future to respond in difficult situations and find a solution with opportunity and optimism. Soon, we will present a document written by the 50 most important Ibero-American business people who have generously given hours of their time thinking and sharing what the keys to recovery will be.</p><h4>Congreso CEAPI have become one of the main business events in Ibero-America. What are the plans for a future event?</h4><p><span></span>We are planning a conference in 2021. We are dedicating ourselves to this and want to have record participation from the largest players in Latin America. It makes more sense to have this event every two years. Business leaders travel often, and we can have smaller meetings more frequently, but the congress can be biennial. Our goal is for October 2021, depending on how the pandemic develops. If the pandemic ends, it will be the best congress in our history, because it will focus more than ever on Ibero-America.</p><h4>What are the key objectives of CEAPI for 2021?</h4><p><span></span>For us, 2021 is a year for Ibero-America. We could not have predicted that the pandemic would impact the entire region, but it did so in an unequal manner, especially in relation to the decisions that countries made and whether or not they allowed businesses to be part of the solution. This has gone better for some countries than others, though no matter what happened, the opportunity for investment will remain relevant, showing that the economy is more global than ever. There will be opportunities and the necessity that the business world, in 2021, demonstrates the capacity for social commitment and creativity to develop projects or support other entrepreneurs. For CEAPI, we will continue to work, as we always have, to defend the figure of business leaders so that governments understand that we are part of the solution as well as establishing connections of trust between the major businesses within the region. We must also not forget our social roles and responsibilities. The more aware we are of this responsibility, the better our future will be for our business, our teams, and our countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did COVID-19 impact the demand for the company's major digitalization drive, and have you noticed any unique trends in your particular region?</h4><p><span></span>When we talk to global and regional CEOs, some commonalities are arising in the discussions regarding the post-COVID-19 situation. Foremost, there is no returning, only pushing through to the new normal, though we are still working on defining this. There are four areas where we will see significant change and reinvention. Digital transformation components intersect all four topics. The first is the workforce and workplace interactions; we will no longer view the workforce the same way, and people will not interact in the same way nor the same places. Perhaps most notably, we will see increased access to global expertise. Having a more flexible, agile, and malleable workforce will be possible in the future, and this has a direct impact on the workplace. The second one is the supply chain; given the quickly introduced travel restrictions, the supply chain was probably the first and most widely impacted part of the business landscape. This has raised several questions around resilience sourcing, a resilient supply chain, and an efficient supply chain in the post-COVID era. The third one is around customer channels. Resiliency should be translated into two different ways to interact and transact with one's customers. Businesses will need to increase interactions with their customer bases online and conduct transactions online. The fourth area is what we call the systems resilience. Within this area, the key element is infrastructure, such as the cloud. The journey to resiliency will create an increased demand for digital transformation components such as the cloud, data, virtualization of interaction channels, automation, workplace mobility, and so on. All the ingredients of digital transformation have a reinvigorated relevance when considering the key elements of a resilient business going forward.</p><h4>Six months from now, where do you see the economy?</h4><p><span></span>Some underlying investments in technology adoption are becoming more obvious post-COVID than they were before. The critical technologies to unlock more potential are related to AI, data, and analytics. Data is becoming more relevant to inform decision making. I used to work in retail, and the main gap is no longer between an e-commerce retailer and a physical retailer. It is the ability to use real-time data to make decisions daily. This is just one example of how the technologies that will capture this untapped value are now becoming more prominent and frequently leveraged. In the past, they were slightly embedded into this complex concept of digital transformation that everyone is talking about. However, we are increasingly parsing out and bringing to the forefront specific solutions and expertise.</p><h4>Within Accenture, how are you reorganizing your priorities when making big decisions to create new hubs?</h4><p>Those investments and decisions are long-term decisions, so when we invest in innovation, it is because we believe those industries will significantly evolve in the coming years. Looking at tourism specifically, we put our innovation center on the frontline of this evolution. The Middle East, with the UAE as a hub in the region and increasingly Saudi Arabia with the willingness to open its treasures to the rest of the world, will continue to be a hotspot for the reinvention of tourism. We are currently working with all innovation centers to brainstorm and innovate around safe events going forward. Everything around innovation in tourism, hospitality, and travel will be mobilized to invent the concept of safe mega-events. This is relevant because of several large-scale events coming up, including Expo 2020, World Cup 2022, and the Olympics. This is what we are doing in the short term in the new context with our innovation hub. Additionally, we are launching VR platforms globally to create networks between dozens of innovation hubs worldwide. Now we have a technology that you can use through your Oculus, PC, or iPad to visit any of those innovation labs like in a video game, creating an increasingly immersive and near-physical experience. This platform is released and is used heavily now within Accenture for any critical discussion. This is a game-changer in the way you mobilize and create experiences around world-class expertise and innovation.</p><h4>Where do you see further bottlenecks and opportunities for Accenture to address?</h4><p><span></span>I see more opportunities than bottlenecks. We probably have enough work with the organizations and institutions that share our vision and belief that the time for reinvention is here. We want to partner with others and accelerate the execution of their vision. You will have bottlenecks in terms of the capabilities of each organization, especially investment capacities in the current context of a global economic slowdown. The focus should be on the organizations that are already in acceleration; the market becomes more significant with the ones that will accelerate in the future. My priority is being fast enough to serve the first mover. In the region, it is likely fair to mention the talent bottleneck. The region is attractive for talent, so we need to play our game better as talent will be critical. Technology is developed through talented people, and the ability to entice the new generation of expertise to the Middle East will remain a crucial element.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Accenture and the broader economy in the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>While we are not immune to the COVID-19 impact, we see a relatively good landing of our current fiscal year and the remainder of the calendar year. It is time to act to transform, as everyone is convinced there will not be a return to the past. It is time to build resilient businesses by accelerating cloud adoption. It is time to be smarter in decision making, with data and analytical technology. We see a demand for our services increasing, as more and more people address the flexibility, agility, and resiliency of their operating models. On the technology side, we see a positive trend in the adoption of cloud, AI, and other elements in the long term as well as a positive demand for services. We have a positive outlook for Accenture across the region. We may extend our footprint to more countries across the Middle East, beyond Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Based on demand, we may need to accelerate our expansion plan. We currently have over 500,000 employees, and the transformation of the workforce is in our DNA because we are continuously skilling and reskilling our people. It is part of what we need to deliver to the communities we operate in. We make it a priority to support local ecosystems. Not only to attract talent but also to shape, skill, and reskill the existing and upcoming local workforce, especially in the Middle East. This is something we want to incorporate into the post-COVID acceleration, and we can raise our game and support the ecosystem.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Industrialization & Mozambique]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[marco-correia-ceo-valoriza]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is industrialization for Mozambique and how should the country develop its industry?</h4><p>Industrialization is a critical stepping stone for the economic development of a country as young as Mozambique. The industrial base of the country has its challenges due to a number of factors, such as access to finance, weak infrastructure, and dependence on imports. The amount of challenges that the country needs to overcome are significant, but there is great potential for growth of a solid and sustainable industrial base. There is an increasing strategic collaboration between the government and the private sector and we must drive growth through a holistic approach that emphasizes the aforementioned challenges. Any talk about industrialization must include an analysis of the country's proximity to regional markets, skilled human capital, access to reliable energy, infrastructure, technology and access to funding solutions, amongst other aspects not mentioned but in no way are less important. Mozambique is blessed with natural resources as well as a strategic geographic position that can be leveraged to serve neighboring land-locked countries, recent history has proven this to be possible. A first step could be the adoption of soft incentives to create a better business environment, such as reducing taxes and tariffs for exports. Large industrial corporations represent less than 5% of our industrial muscle, while the other 95% is comprised of SMEs. Here is where our attention needs to be focused as entrepreneurs, and drive growth of these SMEs by deploying our knowledge and assets towards creating value-added products and consequently improve our exports.</p><h4>What is the philosophy behind Valoriza's investments?</h4><p>Valoriza is an industrial investment company. We believe in industrialization through partnerships, so we are always looking out for like-minded partners. We operate as a private equity firm, applying our knowledge to smaller companies in which we identify potential for growth, which essentially stems from the capacity to access local raw materials, add value, and export. One main theme in our investment drive is the recovery of industrial assets. Our shareholders established that a key starting point of any industrialization process is the existence of a solid steel industry. Therefore, in December 2018, with a local partner, Escopil Indústria, we invested in Duys Mozambique, a heavy steel engineering company with the capacity to design, fabricate, install, and maintain heavy structures. Duys Moçambique employs 250 people, 98% of which are Mozambicans. Since acquiring the company, we have seen consistent growth. Through Duys Moçambique we now feel that we are capable of capitalizing on our experience in the sector and are looking to diversify our portfolio and deploy our engineering experience into other industries looking for growth and innovative technology.</p><h4>What other sectors are you interested in?</h4><p>We want to diversify our investments. Our main focus is to provide value in the manufacturing sector, driving up economies of scale and promoting technological progress for the economy. Naturally, we are looking at sectors where the country is innately competitive such as mining, ports and harbors, and agroindustry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Building Mozambique]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[edney-vieira-ceo-and-chairman-cimentos-de-mocambique]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the contribution of Cimentos de Moçambique (CM) to the development of Mozambique?</h4><p>In 2019, CM celebrated 95 years of operations. For a good part of its close-to-100 years of history, state-owned CM was the only company in the field, meaning that CM has built the entire country from the ground up. Since opening up to private investors in 1994, the market has become increasingly competitive, but CM still holds a great market share playing the leading role within the industry. Our contribution to developing Mozambique is multifaceted: not only have we built the country's cities and infrastructure, but by investing in our plants and facilities and pushing an expansion plan that has brought us to operating five facilities along the whole geography of Mozambique, we have set the ground for Mozambique's industrialization. Our most important contribution, however, is the development of local content and the confidence we have instilled in our employees. We have helped them to grow and mature. Finally, a somewhat surprising contribution that we are having as a cement industry player is on the front of sustainability. In 2015, we started co-processing crude oil residuals from Petromoc in our kiln, and in 2017, we started doing the same with oil and solid residuals (SPL) from Mozal. Thus far, we have processed 4,000 tons of oil and 2,000 tons of SPL. In 2019, we implemented a program that was pioneered in South Africa, whereby we are receiving unusable tires and processing them. As of May 2020, we have processed 971 tons of pneumatics.</p><h4>How optimistic are you about Mozambique's economic recovery?</h4><p>Unfortunately, Mozambique is often dominated by a negative narrative of being “the country where the future never arrives." Too many times we have been waiting for developments and booms that never materialized. We began 2020 with huge hopes, with the development of the LNG projects on the horizon and the metical showing no sign of devaluation. Therefore, we had stretched our targets for 2020, expecting a much better year than 2019. COVID-19 took all of us by surprise, and we are once again waiting for a brighter future. However, I am not negative about Mozambique's future. What is special about Mozambique is its low-cost of economy. In a USD15-billion economy, we do not need a great input of investments to put the economy back in motion. Given the kind of investments in the pipeline, it's truly possible that Mozambique can recover faster than other economies.</p><h4>How can CM and the cement industry capitalize on Mozambique's bright future?</h4><p>The LNG industry will be the driving engine for growth across all sectors. Construction of large-scale infrastructure will be, by nature, the pillar of economic growth. On one side, large infrastructure is required by gas projects, and on the other, large infrastructure will be the preferred form of re-investing gas revenues because it is the most effective solution to unemployment as it rapidly inserts thousands of people into the formal economy. The LNG industry is by nature high-tech, so Mozambique's local content cannot be involved in every step; however, the government has tried to maximize the utilization of local content where possible. Cement production is definitely one of these areas. There is no need to import cement, unless where expressly required by technical criteria. As a leading player in the local cement industry, we want to ensure that at least 85-90% of the cement consumption for these projects comes from local producers. This will allow us to create jobs, keep the money flowing internally, and push the government's plan for industrialization. It is time for us to increase the level of internal production and give value to local products in order to ensure a better future for the coming generations. We have to create this virtuous cycle where the money generated in Mozambique will be reinvested here in benefit of the Mozambicans.</p><h4>One of the challenges in your industry is high transportation costs, which ultimately result in higher prices for the end consumer. What can be the solution to this?</h4><p>There are a variety of solutions, and Mozambique should be exploring all of them and find the best for the short, mid and long-term view, as they will all benefit the country. So far, there is only one national road that connects the north to the south. The country should heavily invest in its road network. Despite the initial high costs, I see a lot of interest from companies and partners to venture in this direction because it will create employment, reduce transportation costs, and boost traffic and commerce. Mozambique should also think of creating a long-distance railway system to transport goods. Finally, in the immediate term, maritime transportation is the most efficient and cheapest way to connect the coastline and allow goods to move within and to/from the country. The country's ports have a huge potential to serve as regional logistic hubs, contending the primacy of South African ports. We are working with the government to see if we can help connect the dots and create the right conditions for these developments. </p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2020?</h4><p>Our main objective currently is to resist the immediate impact of COVID-19 and protect our workers. Financially, the impact of COVID-19 is undeniable. We are currently looking at a 15% sales reduction for 1Q2020, but we have positive expectations for some sort of recovery in 2Q2020. Reaching our sales target will be the key in 2020. We are keeping our strength in the cashflow, working with the existing capital to resist the crisis and making sure the company is in a healthy state once we step out of the pandemic, to capture upcoming opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What should be the response of the banking sector to support the economy during COVID-19?</h4><p>At the beginning of the outbreak and the lockdown, the central bank was quick to reduce interest rates and adopt a series of emergency measures to give relief to customers who already took put loans, because interest is a real cost. These were supported by the banking sector at large as temporary solutions; however, lowering interest rates increases aggregate demand, which in turn puts pressure on foreign currency. This has to be generated by exporters, though in this climate exporters cannot export, and most manufacturers are closed. The strategy of lowering interest rates will not work long term, given the impossibility of getting in foreign currency. We need an alternative long-term solution. In our view, the fight is about getting the majority of people into the banking system and venturing into new territory that has never had access to credit and debt payment. Once we bring them in, we can begin to add credit to new customers. We do not want to continue adding credit to big corporates that already have the dead weight of past credit. That is how we can mitigate risk. To do this, we need to tackle two aspects: technology and customer costs. The advantages of technology have been made all too evident during this crisis, enabling business to keep going despite lockdowns. This crisis should serve as a wake-up call for Mozambican banks to abandon the traditional brick-and-mortar model and embrace technology. There is no reason why we should force customers to come in and queue in bank branches. Investing in technology allows us to not only make banking more accessible, closer to people, increase efficiency, but also reach the unbanked communities in this country and bridge the gaps of financial inclusion.</p><h4>How is BancABC pursuing financial inclusion?<br></h4><p>Financial inclusion is an absolute priority of our mission in Mozambique. At first, we began expanding into the different provinces, reaching our current footprint with 10 branches in five provinces. However, we quickly realized the inherent limits to the brick-and-mortar approach, and in 2017 we shifted to a new model, agency banking, which allows us to enter communities through agents and open and manage bank accounts through the internet. Technology is a key component of our current strategy: through an agent's tablet, people can open an account, apply for a card, and take care of all banking operations. This also does away with paperwork, bringing advantages in terms of both efficiency and environmental terms and allows us to bring into the fold new people who would normally not have bank accounts. We have built a strong network with hundreds of agents now, and we have tripled our customer base since launching the banking agents. Numbers have grown exponentially, and in the next five years, we expect several million new customers through these initiatives.<br></p><h4>In what way can your solution stand out from other banks are pushing agency banking?</h4><p>It is a matter of choosing the right strategy and technology. Agency banking was initially configured by giving each agent a POS-looking device that could open accounts and do transactions using biometrics features to cope for literacy problems. This was not a sustainable model to scale up our agent network, given the individual cost of the devices. Therefore, we decided to invest in a more affordable kind of technology, using phones or tablets. We cannot charge much as banks here, and whenever we are rolling something out, it has to be cost effective. With some technologies, we are still testing the market in pilot phases; but overall we are on the right track.<br></p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020 and the future of BancABC, given the challenges in the market?</h4><p>We are a medium-sized bank, and there is an opportunity for us to gain market share from bigger banks. As we improve our technology and our client relationship management abilities, we see a strong increase in our customer base. We have launched many products, and each of them touch clients in different ways, so our clients are doing more business with us than ever. This is not the first crisis we are going through, and it is no different from other challenges in the past. The situation in the last few years was hard for the banking sector, due to the financial crisis and high interest rates. We saw a complete slowdown in credit, and the focus was on growing deposits, which we were able to double since 2016. As interest rates are now coming down, we need to push on the loan side to balance our operations. After COVID-19, everyone will want to borrow. We expect many more customers and are optimistic about meeting our targets for 2020. Looking to the future, we see a transformation happening, starting from the population. More and more youths are accessing education. As a bank, we want to develop our human capital, absorb youths, and give them a chance to grow. Young people who are coming into the system are our future, therefore we strongly believe in investing in our people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[jerry-mobbs-ceo-vodacom-mocambique]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Vodacom's strategy for 2020?</h4><p>The three pillars of our strategy are to build more coverage, increase our customer base, and get them to use 4G data. The more people have smartphones, the more they can access the entire app ecosystem in the world. We have over 7.5 million voice customers, 4 million of which use data. A major push is to get them to use 4G. We started subsidizing 4G phone because the data rate in 4G is significantly better than 3G; so far, we have over half a million 4G phones. In terms of extending the network coverage, this is a balancing act. We continue to grow our coverage aggressively and add capacity to the existing coverage to accommodate the growing number of users, the increased consumption of data, and the rising demand for speed.</p><h4>How do you measure against the competition?</h4><p>The Mozambican market is dominate by three operators, which represents about the right balance. One is a monopoly, two is a duopoly, while too much competition means no one makes money, and therefore no one invests. In Mozambique, the competition keeps us awake at night and pushes us to constantly innovate and keep up with the innovations. We are pushed to bring prices down, extend coverage, and deliver a competitive service. The government also needs revenue and extended coverage for its own programs, so this is a win-win situation for all. In terms of our competitive advantage, we have the largest 4G network and the highest number of 4G sites. We are catching up quickly with coverage and high-quality service in the rural areas. The M-Pesa platform, where we have put in extensive effort over the last six years, acts as an important differentiator.</p><h4>How do you leverage opportunities offered by the M-Pesa to increase competitiveness?</h4><p>We have rapidly come to see M-Pesa as a distribution platform that services a social good; for example, financial inclusion of the unbanked. Around 60% of M-Pesa customers do not have a bank account. We are now introducing a Learn Market Place, whereby our 4.3 million M-Pesa customers can access loans from Mozambican banks and repay them, all through their mobile phones. We want this to be an open platform with all banks competing for our customers, thus providing competitive deals. Often, people in unbanked areas end up paying high charges because of the lack of competition; we want to provide a service that promotes financial inclusion and launch this in 2020. We signed an agreement with the first bank and are finalizing work on the platform, which will serve as a pilot. Based on default rates and risk levels, we will extend the network of banks offering loans through the platforms. The beginning will be slow, but we expect the take-off rate to increase through word of mouth. We are constantly looking at ways now where our M-Pesa platform can facilitate the growth of other sectors. For example, we are launching a partnership with energy company Fenix International to put in a high-capacity high-quality solar panel system repaid over M-Pesa. A great solar power system can cost up to USD100, which is a large sum of money when income is measured on a short daily or weekly basis. The goal is to make the daily usage of this solar system and collection down. This is where M-Pesa plays a role.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Looking Forward to Economic Recovery in Mozambique]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[mohamad-ali-ahmad-managing-director-premier-group]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Premier Group benefitted from the fusion with Spar?</h4><p>In 2002, my father Hussein Ali Ahmad founded Premier. The business originally focused on building materials, hardware, and sanitary ware products. Rapid expansion then led to the inclusion of the toys, sports, outdoor, stationery, and home and decoration categories. In 2010, the food component was added. We have benefited from our partnership with the international Spar Group in a number of ways but most importantly from the group's purchasing power, which provides a vast range of products to supply to the Mozambican market. However, we did not just replicate the South African business model in Mozambique; our business model and retail strategy has been built on many years of experience in the Mozambican market and our innate understanding of our customers' needs, which when coupled with the Spar Group has helped create a unique business model in Mozambique. </p><h4>How has the retail sector been affected by the economic recession of past years? What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>The economic recession posed strong challenges to our business and the retail sector. But we have come a long way from when, in the space of two weeks, the meticais devalued 50% to the US dollar, causing enormous challenges in cost controls, sourcing of goods, pricing of goods, cash flow management, return on investment, and the challenges of sourcing foreign currency to pay international suppliers. All of this was coupled with one of the main constraints for our sector: Mozambique's massive reliance on imports, which makes the country highly exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. Despite this, I am optimistic about the country, the economic outlook, and our future. The country now seems to have weathered the storm well, and we are now looking forward to an economic recovery. We have already seen a significant change in 2019 compared to previous years. When a recession hits, customers start looking for the cheapest, most cost-effective products; now the trend is slowly turning toward mid-range products. This is an indicator of a higher degree of conditions, relaxation, and stability in the Mozambican market.</p><h4>Why did you venture into an expansion plan in the midst of economic recession in 2017?</h4><p>With every recession comes opportunities in disguise. We had to reinvent ourselves. I like to say that we have to be like water, able to adapt and reinvent ourselves any way the world hits us. We have learnt to adapt to changing scenarios, to the economy, to our consumers, and to our employees. In 2017, we launched four retail stores and one factory. The expansion plan included a 5,800sqm supermarket, a 1,300sqm toy and baby store called Fantazia; both in Baia Mall in Maputo, a 7,500sqm hypermarket at Novare Matola Mall, and a cash-and-carry wholesale store, Maputo Fresh Market, which focuses on supplying fresh fruit and vegetables among food and non-food products to other businesses, hotels, and restaurants. We have also opened Espiga d'Ouro, a USD 50 million investment in the form of a bread factory. It can produce up to 1.3 million loaves of bread per day. Everything is fully automated, which guarantees the highest levels of efficiencies and of course hygiene for our consumers. </p><h4>What are Premier's main strengths?</h4><p>Our personal involvement, passion in execution, total refusal to allow any obstacle to block us, and our constant determination to improve our customer service, controls within our business, and always searching for the next level of growth are our main strengths. Our most important one, however, is our proximity to our customers. We have provided them with a wonderful shopping experience, offering a vast range of products, with competitive pricing, comforts, and the highest levels of hygiene. Customer service is what defines us and has been the root of our success and growth. However, our primary vehicle for assuring that this is achieved is our people: 1,500 staff across five stores and two warehouse distribution centers in Premier Superspar alone, and over 2500 people across the other Premier Group subsidiary companies. Another strength is our perpetual securing of inventory, guaranteeing the availability of products at all times. The execution of our principles and the management of our people has led to a number of recognitions, such as Best Retail Store award for nine consecutive years since 2012 and Highest Growth in Earnings award measured among the top 100 companies in Mozambique by KPMG.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We are striving to consolidate and establish ourselves as the first-choice destination retailer within the Mozambican market. To prepare for the future challenges, we are currently in the process of implementing process automation and vertical integration within our business, increasing our competitiveness, and our total market offering. We intend to better integrate technology into our business, from automatic orders locally, regionally, and internationally to automatic replenishments of stock between our stores. In the final analysis, our goal is not just linked to business. I look at us and what defines who we are and our proven success. We want to leave our footprint as a model and integral part of the development of the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of Prosa within the Mexican payment system?</h4><p><span></span>Prosa has been in the Mexican market for over 50 years. Prosa was founded as a switch to process transactions for credit, debit, and prepaid cards in Mexico. Our platform enables the transaction from the acquirer to the issuer and back with an authorization or decline in milliseconds. Prosa is also the owner of Carnet, which is a locally-accepted brand since 1968. Now, we are working on a project to take Carnet to the international scene. We have also improved our products' attributes and our pricing to be more competitive. Additionally, in 2019 we launched our innovation lab to provide plug and play digital solutions to our more than 160 clients, including banks and other financial institutions. </p><h4>What are the main areas of opportunities for payment systems in emerging markets?</h4><p><span></span>Innovation will be key to taking advantage of opportunities in emerging markets. Innovation will not just be an issue for emerging countries but for all countries. There is also a great deal of fintech companies from Mexico and LATAM that rank among the best in the world, with whom we could partner. Prosa must be able to seek the best technology around the world. To do this, we have established an alliance with FinConecta, for a solution called FintSpace, which has been developed by our Innovation Lab, Fintspace is the first marketplace for digital solutions to connect financial and non-financial companies. In Prosa, we will continue to leverage technology - QR code, e-commerce, blockchain, P2P solutions, B2B, and Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, or Google Pay - to create solutions that are beneficial for businesses.</p><h4>How have consumption trends changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p><span></span>The number of face-to-face transactions has fallen. We saw a YoY reduction in April 2020 and expect the same drop for May 2020; however, the transition to the digital world has accelerated adoption times. COVID-19 has shown us that we are capable of adapting. We will have to learn to spend more time at home and be more efficient in terms of working remotely. We have to look at how industries will change. Every activity that requires the physical presence of clients will experience a drop. It has been announced that at least 30,000 businesses are expected to close permanently; hence, Mexico must establish policies on how SMEs need to transform their business to make suitable for the online world.</p><h4>What projects are you focused on currently?</h4><p><span></span>We will continue to invest in our core systems. We will continue to be active in regard to the technology that is still to come. In disruptive times such as these, there is need to work on reinforcing our protocols, processes, and infrastructure for a safe and solid digital transformation. Prosa has also been heavily focused on taking care of its people and clients. We have invested a great deal of time and effort to ensure that our stakeholders are well. Today, we have 700 people in our team, and 83% of them work from home. We have not experienced any operative impacts, and our people are well and safe. In addition to many other lessons, COVID-19 is teaching the world that remote work will become the new normal. </p><h4>In what ways will you continue to grow both nationally and internationally?</h4><p>We will focus on both our national and international growth. We are a Mexican company, and there are many opportunities in Mexico. There is a great deal of interest in the payment service, because most businesses in Mexico continue to be cash only. This cash-only trend means there is a huge opportunity to incorporate new digital payments. So, we need to continue growing the infrastructure for Mexico such as ATMs, POS terminals, and internet services. After our growth in Mexico, we will focus on internationalization in Central and South America, where today we are already servicing some clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The COVID-19 crisis has tested leadership structures all over the world. How did Saudi Arabia form a response in the early days of the crisis?</h4><p><span></span>I was appointed less than one year, and I have come to see this as an opportunity not only to learn but also to act on things we likely would have difficulties convincing society and government to move ahead with. The industrial sector in Saudi Arabia is so important that the government created this new ministry to support it, along with mining. While there is much to be done, my predecessors have done a lot in the past, and the resilience we have just witnessed is a demonstration of how the country is prepared. Saudi Arabia stood out as one of the best prepared in terms of citizens having access to essentials such as food, medicine, and daily supplies. The disruption to the overall supply chain system worldwide is also reordering how countries go about their old way of doing things. We will definitely have new rules in the future, so the bold decision by the government to let this crisis be led by health and safety shows how the country is serious about the well-being its people.</p><h4>Are there trends in digitalization in response to COVID-19 that will likely continue beyond the crisis?</h4><p><span></span>We have become much more efficient because of digitalization. Communication is far superior. We had the tools available in the past, but never had the urge or need to push that last mile to use it and be comfortable with it. Today, when we look at our industrial sector and how to build an ecosystem such as our industrial cities, it proves we were on the right track. The Minister of Communication was talking about the infrastructure that it has built in the last three years, and if that had not been done, we would be in a different situation today. This has been a test of our vision's direction.</p><h4>Which of your efforts to stimulate the economy during this time have been most important, and how have you coordinated with SAMA and other agencies?</h4><p><span></span>As a government official, the most important thing is how we were able to coordinate all the efforts. There were many committees created that filtered or consolidated in higher committees. There was one specifically for the economy that I was a part of, and it had all the ministers who oversaw areas on the economic side. We were holding discussions twice a week and had teams helping us to link all the different incentive packages that we tested. The beauty is the ability to bring all these heads together and make them look at one thing. That is how we reduced the negative consequences on the economy and ensured that the essentials the available. The affected sectors received assistance. We realized from the beginning the biggest impact would be on cashflow, so we addressed everything in this manner from the start. At the level of industry and mining, we started by rescheduling and delaying payments for all loans for all SMEs in 2020. This was granted without any discussion, so they did not even need to apply. All medium-sized companies in essential sectors such as food, drugs, and supply chain also received this automatically. The remaining medium and large companies had to apply, as we needed to assess their individual issues. We also monitored if these initiatives were actually being utilized effectively, as we designed different initiatives of different types. We asked all entities with an oversight of the economic sector how they could help. In my area, we had MODON, the Royal Commission, Exxon Bank, and SIDF, who we put together to come up with ideas on how we could help. We reduced some fees, some were waived, projects were given extension times, and licenses were extended. Currently, we are monitoring how these packages actually helped the different sectors, what more we can do, and how we can improve. The numbers for the month of June are extremely positive; we had 118 new industrial licenses issued in June and around 2,000 new employees come into the system, so things are picking up slowly. Overall, many of the systems we have put in place under pressure will endure.</p><h4>What allowed you to pass the mining regulation, which has been delayed for many years, so early in your tenure, and what will the short-term outcome be?</h4><p><span></span>This is definitely an exciting sector. The decision to join mining with industry gives a clear idea of how the government intends to develop the mining sector. Mining is a sector with a large amount of raw material but the intention is to create a value chain through the industrial sector. The law intends to improve the clarity and transparency of how we do things in this country, and FDI will be an important part of growing this industry. We were also able to clarify how we deal with water resources because a great deal of mining projects will require water resources. Finally, as this sector is capital intensive in the long term, we need to ensure there are the tools to ensure different players are able to access financing. Saudi Arabia has many different resources in this sector that are untapped, so there is a great opportunity and more to come up with aggressive plans to push this through and communicate with international players.</p><h4>How will you balance the opportunities for Ma'aden and international players?</h4><p><span></span>Ma'aden is a player in this sector like anyone else. It is important for us to not only say that but also behave in this way to ensure all investors will be taken the same. One thing that is clear in all investment is that international FDI is 100% treated like local. We will not give any nationality or country an advantage, as we are looking for investors with the ability to explore the opportunity. We know we are late in this sector, but because of that we expect to use technology to leapfrog in the sector. If anything, we will favor international players because of the element of expertise and knowledge they bring. We are serious about attracting investors at the national level.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2021 and 2022, and what have you learned from managing the ministry and country through this crisis?</h4><p><span></span>Winston Churchill said to never waste a crisis, and I definitely intend not to waste this crisis. My priorities have shifted with this crisis in a positive way. International trade will change, and we need to understand how this will affect us. Who would have thought countries would disregard global trade principles and ban the export of certain products? And, yet, everyone understood why they were doing so. Nonetheless, these have forced us to build up our own resilience and ability to produce essentials here. In addition, in the past we looked at the industrial sector as a rigid sector that is capital intensive with no room for small players. This is changing now, on not only the service and supply sides but also the technology side. This is a great opportunity, and we will help entrepreneurs take advantage of the sector. As part of our program, we have created an opportunity for mask manufacturing players to triple their capacities, and we will provide them with a loan and an offtake agreement to guarantee their investment. We are set to produce 10 million masks a day, so if you are able to increase from 600,000 to 10 million, this signals how strong you are as a country and how good a foundation you have. You just need to give the right support, and you will get the results. The government is excited about utilizing this difficult time to push the pipeline of projects and ensure there is no obstacle from its end. We want our newly established Exim Bank to help people facing difficulties due to the business slowdown to have access to international markets, for example. The number of changes happening will definitely keep us on our toes for at least the next 12 months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Leading Brands of Spain Forum was founded in 1999 with only 17 companies, but today it has more than 100 members. What can you tell us about the Forum's evolution and achievements over the years?</h4><p><span></span>During the first 19 years, the Leading Brands of Spain Forum was chaired by José Luis Bonet. As for its objectives, the Forum comprises two aspects: a private association supported by membership fees and the foundation, which is one of the pillars of the Forum. The private association's fundamental objective is to improve the competitiveness of Spanish companies by strengthening their brand image, which constitutes a fundamental added value. Our main goal is to develop strong and competitive brands, not only in Spain, but around the world. Then, there is the public-private board, which we have established with the current administration, in collaboration with the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including entities attached to those ministries such as ICEX, the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office, the Spanish Chamber of Commerce, and Turespaña. If Spain's reputation is based on the reputation of its largest brands, then smaller Spanish brands can also benefit from it. This has been the core of our mission for over 20 years.</p><h4>“Spain for Sure" is a campaign launched by the Leading Brands of Spain Forum in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the EU, Global Spain, the Spanish Chamber of Commerce, and CEOE. How did the idea for this campaign come about, and what are its main objectives?</h4><p><span></span>The idea came from the Secretary of State of Global Spain, specifically from Manuel Muñiz, on the occasion of the eighth promotion of Honorary Ambassadors of Spain Brand. In recent months, I spoke with Muñiz on many occasions, and after thorough discussions we concluded that now, more than ever, it is necessary to promote the Spain brand. To further promote this initiative, a virtual meeting was organized with some of our Spain Brand ambassador from different fields such as sports (Pau Gasol, Rafael Nadal y Fernando Alonso), science (Valentí­n Fuster, Marí­a Blasco y Pedro L. Alonso), culture (Antonio Banderas, Edurne Pasabán e Isabel Coixet), and the King and the Queen of Spain. This meeting was organized during the hardest times of the lockdown to analyze the effect of the crisis in the international reputation of Spain. “Spain for Sure" has two meanings. On one hand, you have the term “sure," which is related to the concept of safety. On the other hand, there is the phrase “for sure," which reinforces the message that Spain is a safe country and open for tourism. We must send a message that we will do everything in our power to guarantee safety and ensure that tourists have a good time in Spain. We have undergone an intense period of fear, not only in Spain but worldwide. It is true that we must be cautious but we cannot live our entire lives in fear.</p><h4>At the end of June, the Forum organized a meeting between its partners and Reyes Maroto, the Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism. What is your personal assessment of this meeting?</h4><p><span></span>The level of involvement of that specific ministry in recent months has been impressive. It has paid attention to the voices of companies and logical demands of companies from all sectors. Unfortunately, Official State Gazettes do not reflect this. So, it seems that the upper levels of government are ignoring the ministry. We denounce this situation whenever we can, and this interview is an opportunity to do so. I have thanked the minister and her entire team a thousand times because, in the end, it is an issue that does not receive enough attention. At the entrepreneurial level, companies are the only entities in society that generate employment. The public sector plays a crucial role in the economy, but it must be fed with taxes, which are generated by private companies and their employees.</p><h4>What is the strategy of the Leading Brands of Spain Forum in terms of strengthening public-private collaboration?</h4><p><span></span>It is easy for us because we have been doing it for 20 years. Our board of trustees constitutes an example of public-private collaboration and a wonderful relationship with all ministries. As the government representatives in the board use to say, “It is nice to come to a place where the private sector gives more than it asks for." This is one of the principles of the Forum. Criticizing politicians for no reason is Spain's national sport, and we are brilliant at it. But you have to do a professional job backed with data from all sectors, regions, customers, and markets. Backed by data, you must explain to the government the best environment for companies to increase their competitiveness and gain international market share, which in turn will benefit Spain.</p><h4>What are the main priorities of the Forum for the rest of the year and 2021?</h4><p>The priority of the Forum is to strengthen the functions it has always had. Given the current situation, if the Forum had not existed, we would have had to create it, since being united in this situation is one of the great advantages the Forum offers. We have many important companies in the Forum, and SMES can lean on them to export their products and on the Forum to establish relations with other companies. Such collaborations will enable us to enhance the competitiveness of Spanish companies in the coming years and improve the image of Spain abroad, just as in the 2008-2014 crisis, when internationalization was promoted in an impressive way. There are many companies that started back then and established infrastructures outside of Spain thanks to the Forum's efforts. The economic conditions in the next few years will not be optimal because it will take some time for purchasing power and consumption to recover. Furthermore, the tourism sector, which is an important source of income for Spain, will not recover quickly either. Due to these reasons, the internationalization of Spanish companies is essential for the country, and in order to achieve this, we must continue to support each other.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the pandemic affected the initial inspection period for Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, and where you are today in terms of the regulatory environment?</h4><p>Regarding Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, we issued the operating license of Unit 1 to Nawah Energy Company on February 17, and a week after they started loading fresh nuclear fuel into the reactor. That process took about three or four weeks, and now it has closed the reactor. They are testing various systems, such as increasing the temperature and pressure. The pandemic did not prevent Nawah from continuing the tests that had been approved by FANR before granting the operating license. Nawah slowed down the construction of other units slightly, and it focused fully on unit 1, continuing the nuclear commissioning activities in order to achieve operation and generate power to the grid when all test had been done successfully. A few years ago, FANR introduced the practice of the resident inspector, and it has proven to be a good practice. Otherwise, it would have been complicated for us to conduct inspections during the pandemic. With a rotating system of inspectors and regular communication, essentially there has been no delays. They are still continuing the testing phase, but the plant has not produced any electricity yet. We do not know when it will be ready to do so, and we are taking an extremely cautious approach. The safety of the nuclear power plant tops our priority.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the 10% drop in power generation globally, and how are FANR and the nuclear industry more broadly handling this situation?</h4><p>We organized a webinar with other representatives and the International Atomic Energy Agency and concluded that the nuclear industry has continued to provide electricity, perhaps with slightly decreased output, regardless of COVID-19. The continuation of power generation from nuclear energy is important in many countries. However, this requires tremendous effort from the nuclear industry and the regulators to work remotely where possible. We have been working on this internally at FANR and will start cooperating with foreign regulators to develop further remote inspections, ensuring the safety of employees, and maintaining compliance in operation of the plants. In the end, nuclear power has to stay safe, in spite of the COVID-19. The nuclear industry is no stranger to crises throughout the years, and this makes us more proactive than most. We have developed business continuity planning and emergency arrangements, and this flexibility and agility is integrated well at FANR. We established the COVID-19 advisory team to move quickly and effectively across areas. This is one strength we have leveraged to manage the pandemic. As previously mentioned, another advantage is our resident inspector system. Moreover, we have advanced e-licensing systems, which address medical and industrial use of radiation, to continue supporting thousands of licensees in the same way as we did before. Another takeaway is that nuclear industry depends on transient workers, and this presents some challenges in the current situation. The supply chain is long, and contractors have many layers, which further emphasize the challenge. The nuclear industry needs to think about how to secure support for the future.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the environment, energy, and economy trilemma?</h4><p>Climate change needs to be a priority, and nuclear power provides part of the solution. It provides clean energy as well as increased energy independence and sustainability for a country. Partnership will be increasingly important as we see a dip in nuclear facilities and related vendors. The UAEhas a strong partnership with South Korea, and this has helped us tremendously. We continue to engage significantly with the regulators in South Korea to exchange and share experience. The outcome of the pandemic is to my opinion giving an opportunity for the local industry to develop to support the maintenance of the Brakah nuclear power plant. There should be a strong incentive now for local industry to develop special niches where they can serve the nuclear industry such that we further establish expertise and self-reliance.</p><h4>How has FANR managed enhancing local capacities in the nuclear sector in these unprecedented times?</h4><p>As a nuclear regulator in the UAE, we have built a strong foundation and staff, a mix of 70% UAE nationals and 30% expats from various countries. This crisis has shown the importance of Emiratization efforts, and the country has advanced significantly, and rightly so. We have now a strong competency framework-based system, so every staff member at FANR has their own competency profile. Most of our trainings now are internal, and at the moment, some training is done remotely. In the succession planning, we have a scheme to put Emiratis in all leading positions and progressively get them up to speed in expert positions, but this requires a longer timeframe and knowledge transfer through hands-on experience. Several years of operation of the Barakah facility will put us in a much better position in this goal. We have the entire infrastructure in place to support this move, and I am optimistic. We are also pleased with the government's aim to introduce younger professional on board of federal authorities. We have H.E. Maitha Al Gergawi attending board meetings, and she is massively contributing the needs, concerns, and perspectives from the youth side. Those aspects now will also be discussed at the board level in a more competent manner, so we are pleased to have her there.</p><h4>Looking at other uses of nuclear and radiation technology, what support has FANR emphasized?</h4><p>The pandemic has not significantly changed our role and activities regarding nuclear energy, as there were already strong systems in place. Of greater concern is the other uses of radiation. We have about 3,000 licenses issued to thousands of companies using radiation, of which 80% are medical clinics and hospitals. Hospitals are generally fairly competent, but we have supported them in establishing temporary hospitals. This has required a great deal of attention from our inspectors. Another area is the industrial application of radiation. The oil industry depends on a number of contractors who circulate in the country with cars loaded with radiation sources. Managing these sources is a matter of life and death, so this is an important aspect. FANR recognizes this, and we have done a great deal of inspections, even nighttime and/or unannounced inspections. The use of radioactive materials makes it a risky industry, and we are ramping up oversight activities while keeping in mind social distancing required by COVID-19. It is important for the public to know that we are there. We normally oversee these activities through unannounced visits as well as an automated system with customs to monitor imports and exports.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main added value that you offer to the market? </h4><p><span></span>Notarí­a 99 Estado de Mexico is currently the only notary firm in Mexico that is investing heavily in digitalization. Most notaries in Mexico only have basic websites. On the other hand, we offer communication channels through our website and social networks such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and others. We want to offer customers the possibility to have better communication with the notary through such tools. We want to make our clients' life easier by simplifying notary processes. We have already programmed the launch of our pilot application at the end of 2020, which can be downloaded for free from the Apple Store and Android Store. The application will enable clients to check the status of their procedures in real-time. Customer service over the telephone can be complicated because at times all receptionists are busy. Long waiting times can wear clients out. Plus, those who have already signed the deed want to get in touch with the notary right away. The worst situation is when a client who has been dealing with the notary for months faces problems when reaching a customer service representative. All of the company's account on social networks are reviewed daily. We have also managed to obtain new clients through such platforms. We have also answered requests from captive clients at the notary.</p><h4>How have your clients reacted to the digitalization of your platforms? </h4><p><span></span>Clients are already using our social media networks to get updates on the status of their writings. Digitalization has pushed us to do a deep restructuration of the firm, not only in terms of investing in systems but also training. We have hired a number of young people over the years. As a public notary, we have to take care of every legal aspect of the procedure. This is part of the process. It is the lawyers who review documents, laws, international treaties, and jurisprudence. However, many lawyers are not trained to handle all the latest technologies and innovations we are introducing. This is where the youth comes in. The people we have hired are system engineers, network engineers, and business administrators. </p><h4>What inspired Notarí­a 99 Estado de Mexico to focus on digitalization? </h4><p><span></span>The need to digitalize the company was a consequence of our work with Infonavit, which is an important Mexican agency that grants credits to workers. As one of the first institutions to digitalize all its procedures in Mexico, Infonavit started requesting electronic submissions of all the paperwork, and as a result, we began training ourselves to meet its demands. Over the years, we become one of the three most-important notaries in the State of Mexico and one of top-10 nationally. Simply put, we started our digital transformation journey because we realized that it is the future. Clients will always prefer to complete the majority of the procedure online rather than coming to the office for every step. Our clients no longer have to attend the notary four times. This holds even more value for clients in cities that face a lot of traffic congestion, such as Mexico City.</p><h4>Why is it important to promote and hire young talent? </h4><p><span></span>Mexico has the advantage of having a young population in comparison to other countries around the world. Unfortunately, as a notary firm, it is challenging to promote young talent in Mexico because laws in the majority of the country require a notary to be at least 40 years old. There are some exceptions though. For example, I became a notary when I was 26 years old because the law was different back then. I was the youngest notary in Mexico at the time. I am taking advantage of my age and gaining knowledge about all the latest technology and innovation in order to offer my clients a unique offer.</p><h4>How much did the company invest in technology?</h4><p><span></span>So far, we have invested around MXN5 million. The application that we are developing will cost us around USD60,000. As one of the 10-largest notaries in Mexico, our team comprises more than 100 people. In comparison, most notaries have only 20 employees.</p><h4>What is the name of the application?</h4><p>We are considering two names right now: Notary 99 State of Mexico and Notary 99 Electronica. We are calling this project Notaria 2.0 since it is basically the rebirth of the notary sector. At a recent press conference, I told the participants that we are not worried about competition in the near future because we will be the only ones offering such a service. Our goal is to promote it through multiple channels, especially word of mouth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of the immediate steps taken during the pandemic and where you are now in terms of your overall business activities?</h4><p><span></span>No one was prepared for what happened, and it has been a bit of a curveball for the whole world. We had strengthened and streamlined our organization early in 2020, and I came into this role as MEA President. Our whole objective was to be more effective and nimbler, always looking to agility and resilience as our two guiding principles when we design the new organization. When the crisis happened, it meant we had to laser focus on resilience and agility, and even though it was still in its beta testing mode, it performed extremely well. The team quickly reacted and pulled together for health and safety, making sure they took the necessary measures to secure our office location and other sites. We took all the precautions, provided personal protection equipment (PPE) where needed, and immediately put a visitor's policy in place. It was a great test for the organization, and everyone reacted well. The main adjustment was working from home, and now approximately 90% of our workforce globally is working remotely. We have helped our customers deliver on their missions, perhaps with even more of a critical view than before and shifted our focus in many cases. Beyond ensuring individual health and safety, we also considered what we could do to help the world get out of this or manage the situation as we go along. We adjusted and are working to develop forward-thinking technologies to cope. We developed 3D printing capabilities to support organizations printing face masks and other PPE in the US, for example. We also tested printing respirator components at our facilities in the US, to potentially support local hospitals. In the long term, we are looking at solutions for high-traffic areas to manage the flow of people. We developed a solution called DetectWise, which is an integrated, touchless suite of solutions that includes advanced analytics software, screening kiosks and modular testing infrastructure. The kiosk utilizes touchless technology to assess the health of the person standing in front of it. This is a quick, scalable solution, and the key differentiators for us are the speed at which they work as well as the secure data collection, customizable analytics, and applied artificial intelligence (AI). It is one of our halo products at the moment.</p><h4>Looking into a future that is increasingly dependent on technology, what is Parsons doing to keep up?</h4><p><span></span>Parsons embarked on a strategy of “enhance, extend, transform.“ The enhance and extend part of that means developing organizations that are resilient, agile, and serve our customer needs. The organizational changes we made at the beginning of 2020 were part of enhancement. The extension part is using our technology to support the business model and expand upon it. We want to address the fact that the problems our clients have are increasingly complex every day. COVID-19 highlighted the complexity of the future, and we are seeing developments that we had anticipated occurring five to 10 years from now. Cloud computing, AI, Internet of Things (IoT), and autonomous systems are the four pillars of technology at Parsons. We have privileged relationships, and we are combining these relationships with fast-forwarding the application these technologies.</p><h4>How are you redesigning or rethinking the way people will move in the future?</h4><p>Six months ago, we were working on smart technology, smart infrastructure, and smart cities, as well as critical infrastructure protection which Parsons has been focused on for a while. All of that is more important than ever, and we have accelerated to the point where it is business critical for everyone to implement these solutions. In transportation, we have several parts of the company looking at those solutions, and they are all linked. We have a laboratory in the MEA region that works directly with a counterpart in the US to leverage the technology developed there. We have solutions that were developed locally in the region as well. We have developed some tools for mobility, and one that we have been talking deeply about with our clients in the region since the end of 2019 is a tool called “Intersection as a Service“ that we developed in the US. Following a sponsorship challenge associated with participation from some customers in the Middle East, the service provides a fast and cost-effective way to adjust traffic signals along a given corridor that does not require an extensive network of sensors or a central brain to manage them. Congestion affects the health and safety of our communities for pedestrians, residents, and motorists alike. The tool will help make that particular place better by facilitating the movement of people. We are working with our clients to implement this in a couple of places in the regions. We have great hopes for that particular solution, though there are a number of other ones.</p><h4>Has your business had to reevaluate its vision of the future compared to pre-pandemic notions, and how has the future of mobility changed?</h4><p>We need to accelerate our thinking about what will happen, what we can provide, and what the world will be like. We are here to listen and work with our customers and partners to bring solutions in addition to fast forwarding the application of some of our technologies and the way we work. In our organization, working from home has been successful, and we have had a number of tools to enhance the solutions we provide to our clients. We have remote solutions as well as a tool called DFuze that enables us to perform site visits and provide executives with a view of their assets and integrate that into a backend management system. For these types of solutions, we had to implement them much earlier than expected. Critical systems such as airports, power plants, and traffic management centers need to keep operating even when people are working from home. It becomes a question of how to keep them operating remotely and safely. Cybersecurity becomes a major issue, and we have witnessed several cyber-attacks, including phishing emails being sent to customers around the world taking advantage of developments in the world now. As a large organization, the ability to link all of our solutions is just one of many of our key strengths. Even more so over the last few months, we have been creating more synergies across business areas and applying technology and solutions from one area to different areas. We are nimble, perhaps even more nimble during the crisis, and we will continue in that way.</p><h4>With the increase in cyber-attacks, how has Parsons protected itself and its clients?</h4><p><span></span>Our protection systems were already fairly robust; it was only a matter of making sure they were operating effectively. When it comes to our clients, working from home introduces challenges in providing oversights. We were able to integrate all of the solutions we usually do, and what we did in our federal government business in the US helped us in our civilian business segments. The needs were essentially the same, whether you are protecting an army base, car plant, or group of offices. However, we cannot rest on our laurels; we cannot believe that what we have today will be adequate for tomorrow. We have to keep working hard to stay on top of trends and prevent hackers. There are people out there as smart and as active as we are, and we have to make sure we protect ourselves and our clients. It is a never-ending quest.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell us about your company's philosophy?</h4><p>Our philosophy is all about delivering end-to-end, one-stop logistics services for our customers in Saudi Arabia and rest of the Middle East. This is accomplished through our three divisions—express, e-commerce, and logistics solutions. We started in 1993, adopted the name NAQEL in 2005, and established ourselves as the leading domestic express logistics company offering door-to-door delivery of shipments greater than 30kgs. After receiving a courier license in Saudi Arabia in 2014, we established our e-commerce division, offering home delivery services for online retail companies around the world for shipments less than 30kgs. Following that, we started to expand in GCC countries and received licenses to operate in neighboring countries. In addition to China, the UK, and the US, we now have licenses for Bahrain, the UAE, Egypt, and Jordan. We are working on getting licenses for other GCC countries as well. We are witnessing a market trend where customers are switching toward online shopping to fulfill their needs as opposed to visiting physical retail stores. Our e-commerce division has reflected significantly higher than the market growth of around 25%. In 2018, we have established logistics solutions division offering industry-specific solutions including warehousing and 3PL services. NAQEL is currently operating across the entire logistics value chain, including freight forwarding to port handling, customs clearance, road transportation, warehousing, and final-mile distribution. Our philosophy revolves around the “C.A.R.E." principals. This means we focus on competent, accountable, respectable, and engaged employees delivering logistics with care for our valued customers. When it comes to competence, we have a training center here. We had started a program called future leaders program around six years ago. It originally focused on hiring engineers and trying to develop them as logistics managers. Currently, we have more than 120 engineers across the country. We spend almost 3% of our revenue in training and developing our employees.<br> </p><h4>Do you plan on expanding more internationally, and how do you plan to strengthen your presence as the Saudi government puts more weight into logistics?</h4><p>After we received the courier license in 2014, we have set-up a fully fledged gateway and bonded clearance facilities at Dammam airport in 2015. We opened a new gateway in the Riyadh Airport in 2019 and similar gateway facilities have been set-up in Jeddah airport this year. These are part of our expansion efforts. From our gateway, we can re-export to other countries and quickly clear goods into Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Industrial Development Fund is also supporting by giving loans to logistics companies to start building desired logistics facilities and meet the ongoing logistics needs of the Kingdom. There has been a number of initiatives by the government under the umbrella of vison 2030 aimed at improving our global competitiveness and logistics ranking as measured by the World Bank, namely the Logistics Performance Index (LPI). We are strengthening our market leadership in the Middle East while connecting the three continents of Asia, Europe, and Africa in line with government's vision 2030 imperatives. We aim to further strengthen our logistics foot-prints in these continents.<br> </p><h4>How do you integrate new technological developments and operate on the big data front?</h4><p>This is one of the areas we are putting a lot of effort. For example, we are trying to implement data-driven decision making in delivery route planning and optimization. This can improve our driver efficiency by as much as 30-40%. When it comes to the last mile, we have more than 1,000 drivers operating in this area, and a 30% increase in efficiency is equivalent to the salary of nearly 300 drivers. We are using AI technology that has been partially developed in-house and outside of NAQEL. We can take into account all the relevant factors and come to an optimal delivery solution. 70% of our e-commerce market is cash-on-delivery, and in this area there is a high return percentage because the customer still has the chance to change his or her mind. We are leveraging on our customer data to analyze their behavior and implement interactive solutions that will further improve our overall service offering.<br> </p><h4>How is the localization of the workforce going?</h4><p>We are combining experts in the field with local Saudi talent. We are in the platinum category when it comes to Saudization. We have more than 1,800 Saudis working at NAQEL out of over 5,000 total employees, or a Saudization rate of 36-37%. In addition to respecting our customers and employees, we respect our owners by making the right choices. We have a nice environment that attracts Saudis to join our workforce, and they have a clear and attractive career path. We also build professional value in them. We also now have more than 250 female employees working at NAQEL. We have a childcare center in order to help them to smoothly transition into the work environment and meet their potential. We want to develop female employees, but in order to do that you must create a culture that supports them. We have built a culture of company-wide employee development, and it is now much easier for us to expand. The entire logistics industry is growing in Saudi Arabia, and that means that we can really take advantage of the professional development of our employees. The vision of Saudi Arabia is to become a logistics hub and to connect three continents, which is the perfect environment for us to develop our workforce and expand our business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Promigas is looking to expand its business outside of Colombia. In which countries does it seek to grow, and what are its projections for 2020?<br></strong>We recently deepened our commitment to expanding operations in Peru through a natural gas distribution agreement with the government in Piura, the second-most populous region after Lima, to reach 250,000 new users. We are also looking at the Caribbean and Centroamerica, where most countries depend on heavy fuel oil as the main power generation source, making them especially vulnerable to volatile oil prices. Natural gas can provide a feasible alternative to reduce fuel oil dependency for roughly 25 million people, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates, thereby lowering electricity prices.</p><p><strong>What is the scope of investment and main goals of the new Gasoducto Jobo-Majaguas pipeline in Sucre and Cordoba, and what impact will it have in the local market?</strong><br>Since December 2018, we have constructed this pipeline, connecting new natural gas reserves to markets in Barranquilla and Cartagena, with a lump-sum investment of USD200 million. It is strategic for all of Colombia's Caribbean coast, since declining natural gas reserves in La Guajira are now compensated by new findings in Sucre and Cordoba. Colombia's largest oil refinery in Cartagena, alongside many other industries in northern Colombia, depends on natural gas as an energy source.</p><p><strong>What is the mission of your Energy and Gas Research and Innovation Center (CIIEG), and what will be its main activities for 2020?</strong><br>CIIEG seeks to develop new energy alternatives for a highly diversified Industry 4.0 solutions portfolio. Amongst many things, we are looking into the optimization of natural gas-powered dedicated vehicles. China already has a 5-million vehicle fleet, and the opportunities in the hemisphere are significant.</p><p><strong>How is Promigas promoting the offshore and fracking explorations on the Caribbean coast, and what potential does the company see with these concessions?</strong><br>We focus on addressing energy affordability as a means for promoting competitiveness and increasing human development. Colombia has a few natural gas sources, namely offshore exploration and unconventional natural gas resources, also known as fracking. It is estimated that offshore reserves in the Caribbean Sea, which include Kronos, Gorgon-1, Purple Angel-1, Tayrona, and Orca-1, hold reserves of up to 30TPC. Our Pacific coast also has offshore potential with the Choco offshore, Tumaco offshore and Pací­fico Profundo, which are estimated to hold 5.88TPC. Currently, Colombia has proven natural gas reserves of just 3.8TPC, which is enough for about 9.8 years; however, we have unconventional natural gas resources estimated between 4-24TPC in Magdalena Medio, Cesar-Rancherí­a, and Catatumbo. If these optimistic estimates materialize, it amounts to a century of natural gas reserves, a real game-changer in energy competitiveness.</p><p><strong>How is Promigas working to promote and educate the markets about natural gas as a cleaner alternative to hydrocarbons?<br></strong>Naturgas, Colombia's natural gas industry association, has done an outstanding job educating the public on the economic, environmental, and health benefits of natural gas: it is 50% cheaper than gasoline and 35% cheaper than diesel, and it has substantially lower CO2 emissions. Bogotá, Medellí­n, Cali, Barranquilla, Cartagena, Manizales, and Palmira have incorporated natural gas-powered vehicles into their mass transport systems, with 1,600 buses serving 1 million passengers daily at the end of 2019.</p><p><strong>What is the growth potential of the LNG market in Colombia?<br></strong>The LNG market growth potential both in Colombia and the hemisphere is significant. Colombia's Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME) has stated the need for a new LNG plant in Buenaventura on the Pacific Coast. This would require the construction of a natural gas pipeline connecting the coast to Yumbo, near the outskirts of Cali. It would require around USD700 million in investment and will begin operations in 2025. Promigas has considered participating. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How was the production environment in 2019?<br></strong>The production environment remained steady in 2019. We are involved in some major infrastructure projects in the mining sector and are extremely satisfied with production. Clearly, everyone would like more production, and we have plans for that, though we are moving into new areas and expanding some of the ramps. We expect some new infrastructure to significantly boost production in 2020. Additionally, we plan to work on ramps and other areas of the mine that are not currently active. We have every reason to believe production will increase as it has done in the past few years.</p><p><strong>What is the status of your jewelry line and other projects?<br></strong>We want to work with the Colombian emerald industry as a whole and support our partners. The emerald mining sector produces high-quality emeralds, commercial-quality emeralds, and other emerald materials. Overall, there is a great demand for the whole line of emeralds.</p><p><strong>Why did you select Geneva and New York as your major distribution centers?<br></strong>New York is one of centers for the gem trade, as is Geneva. We have worked with agents, sellers, and buyers in other parts of the world in Asia and the Middle East, but New York and Geneva are excellent places as centers of distribution.</p><p><strong>Are there other markets you would like to target?<br></strong>We would like to be in all the major markets of the world, whether it is the Middle East, China, Europe, the US, or South America. Our sales staff are constantly looking for new opportunities. We have no problem selling our product; we concentrate on production and quality. Emeralds, especially high-quality emeralds, are rarer than diamonds. This is one of the reasons the price has continued to rise. Colombia produces the bulk of the world's high-quality emeralds.</p><p><strong>How are you aligned with the government's agreement to export a percentage of emeralds to the Chinese market?<br></strong>These agreements were recently signed. We are in contact with Acodes, part of Federales Esmeraldas, and it helped negotiate these agreements with the Chinese government. The issue was that there were extremely high taxes on importing emeralds from Colombia into China, as well as other obstacles. Acodes is working on removing those obstacles to make the flow of Colombian emeralds to the Chinese market easier. We support those efforts but are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. We eventually intend to be full participants.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to bring the relevant stakeholders together to achieve Colombia's goal of being the top emerald exporter by 2025?</strong><br>We have had tremendous support from the government. This industry can grow significantly and can dominate the global industry. What we need is capital investment, either Colombian or foreign. We need the government to adopt policies that will favor the industry. We have to go out and make sure the world knows the value of Colombian emeralds. We know we have the best product. When the industry has matured and is producing at the level it should, there will be no question that people will want Colombian emeralds.</p><p><strong>How are technology and innovation changing production?<br></strong>To find more emeralds, one needs to expand mines and go deeper. To operate a mine in a modern fashion in accordance with the law, they need technology. To operate the mine efficiently, they need geological information. There are many different things that come together to make the mine more efficient. Our goals are mainly about modernization and expansion of the mine. Notably, due to our overall standards, we were ranked one of the top-10 mining companies in Colombia by Brújula Minera. It was the first-time ever an emerald mining company was included in this ranking. We were also rated fifth in terms of how we treat our workers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us more about your initiative to formalize illegal small-scale miners in Colombia? <br></strong>We have 46 cooperatives for miners producing and complying with security, safety, and environmental aspects. We support them from a technical point of view, they serve us the material they produce, and we remunerate them according to international standards.</p><p><strong>How have you managed in others way to have a positive impact on those communities? <br></strong>We have a scholarship in place; the school is bilingual, and we meet the expenses (salary, house, food and transportation) of volunteer teachers. Currently, we have 475 students in the primary school and are set to open a secondary school shortly. </p><p><strong>How is the company trying to reduce the use of mercury? <br></strong>That was a problem arising from illegal mining, where the output was sold to small processing facilities. We use mercury to amalgamate the gold. In other cases, we buy material for the processing facility that does not use mercury. Currently, we are building a plant to recover zinc and lead to sell. It is a combination of an environmental project and a profitable one.</p><p><strong>Gran Colombia Gold remains the largest producer of gold and silver in Colombia. What has been its strategy in the market?<br></strong>This company was once on the verge of bankruptcy, and the key to its success has been its people. A company is its people, which is why we give our people the best benefits according to international standards. Second, we have financial discipline and, third, we strive to obtain all the environmental and social licensing or permits.</p><p><strong>How was the company able to break its gold production record last year?<br></strong>Gran Colombia Gold has been growing at a rate of 20% per year since 2014. Our production in 2014 was 90,000oz of gold between Segovia and Marmato and 240,000oz in 2019. Financial discipline has been a key issue, but our people are a key element in our success, as is the technology we utilize and our work with the local community. When we arrived in the territory, we grasped the situation of illegal mining and sought to work with those engaged in it. To date, we have signed with 44 mining units and have a small mining team in place dedicated to them. Other initiatives have to do with the issue of education, which is necessary for development, and that is where our scholarships come into play. We also have a training program for women to integrate them into the economy. Women who are heads of households, if they do not have a husband, have no way to support their children. For example, our security team is mostly made up of women, specifically single mothers. We have an alliance with The National Training Service (SENA) to provide proper training. We are also building a school with it and investing in other such initiatives.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020 and the upcoming years? <br></strong>The main goal in Segovia concerns drilling and infrastructure, since we expect to find and extract. In Marmato, we expect to finalize it mid-2020 and then start building the new mine. We expect to have the first bar of gold by the end of 2022. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the company position itself as an industry leader?<br></strong>Drummond has been taking care of business in times when the market has not been the best. Despite facing low prices, the company has been cost conscious in its operations. We have always taken excellent care of our customers. Looking at the market, we have diversified our customers and moved a large amount of our coal to Asia, which was not the case 10 years ago. At the time, we sold about 50% of our coal to the US. Then, the US started fracking and produced a large amount of oil and gas with it. Its coal-based power plants were converted into gas plants. That forced us to start looking for other markets. Now, we have diversified and sell coal to about 25 different countries all over the world.</p><p><strong>How has the company prepared to cope with recent low coal prices?<br></strong>At the moment, we have an important infrastructure in Colombia in mining, ports, and railroads. Rather than reducing production, we are maintaining the same level of production and exports, with very few variations. We are also trying to maintain and use the infrastructure as best we can with the resources we have. We have 1.4 billion tons in reserves. The other key issue is our CSR programs. Maintaining a good understanding and relationship with the surrounding communities has been important to developing our projects. Having support from the community helped us to obtain all the necessary permits to continue advancing with our remaining plans.</p><p><strong>What was the result of the Bettercoal evaluation in 2019?<br></strong>It was positive. Colombia is in a great position among the countries Bettercoal has been evaluating. Within Colombia, Drummond is in a solid position as well, and the evaluation showed that we made improvements in many areas. There are still some areas where we can make many important improvements, and we are in a constant process of improving these. In general, though, it was a positive evaluation. We were the first company in the world to be audited by Bettercoal in 2014.</p><p><strong>What about professional formation?<br></strong>In terms of our CSR and matching that with our operational needs, the formation and training of workers is one of our key priorities. With that in mind, we put together our in-house training program. Most of the locals in the area have a basic level of education, and we give priority to locals. They do not have access to the level of education needed, so we offer in-house training programs instead of having them attend SENA, the Colombian public institution focused on the development of professional formation programs, which often doesn't offer training in the skillset we need. That is why we do our own training. At Drummond, we employ people from the local area for a full year of paid training with benefits. Today, we have about 60 people in the program, nearly all of whom land a permanent job with us by the end of it. We also offer 20 university scholarships per year for the best students at local public high schools, from families with low incomes. Including those awarded in 2020, we have handed out 150 scholarships. The scholarship not only pays their tuition, but also gives them money for their meals, materials, and transport. Today, we have a large number of graduates who are working for Drummond. They went to schools built by Drummond, with teachers trained by Drummond in one way or another, and received scholarships financed by Drummond to go to university. Now, they have found a job working for Drummond. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>TEBSA is Colombia's largest consumer of natural gas and the biggest thermal plant in the electrical system. Can you tell us about the scale and size of TEBSA's operations and the growth you saw in 2019?<br></strong>TEBSA is the biggest thermal generator in the Colombian electricity system and the largest single gas consumer in the country. We have the capacity to produce almost 10% of Colombia's total energy demand and nearly 35% of the total energy demand of the Caribbean coast. Colombia's electrical system is composed of approximately 70% hydro and 30% thermal capacity. During the last El Niño, Colombia's thermal capacity produced 55% of the country's total energy demand, demonstrating the importance of thermal capacity to respond to different environmental challenges. Additionally, TEBSA is located in the Caribbean region, which has the highest energy consumption growth rate and energy demand in the country. In 2018, Colombia's energy demand grew by 3.3% compared to 5.5% on the Caribbean coast. Due to the area's contribution to the growth of the economy, TEBSA is essential to supporting the growth of not just the Caribbean coast, but the country as a whole, by securing access to at least 2,000MW of gas-fired energy.</p><p><strong>Aside from increasing supply through importation, is TEBSA promoting increased local production of natural gas in Colombia?<br></strong>We also currently have medium-term local gas supply contracts that have been contributors to the development of new gas fields located on Colombia's Atlantic Coast. They have contributed significantly to expanding the local gas transportation capacity to connect those new fields to the grid. New fields and gas pipelines can only be developed if there is significant gas demand, so TEBSA is essential to the growth of Colombia's local supply and transportation capability.</p><p><strong>How is TEBSA promoting Colombia's shift to renewable energy sources?<br></strong>We need to bear in mind that Colombia's energy generation matrix is one of the cleanest in the world. This is different from other countries, such as the US or Germany, where you find a higher proportion of thermal gas and coal-fired generation than renewables. The government has sent a clear signal to develop renewable energy in Colombia, and we see renewables and efficient gas-fired technology as complementary energy sources. Renewables have posed significant challenges, given the natural intermittent renewable production. With today's existing technology, we still cannot store significant amounts of energy. If renewables are to penetrate Colombia's energy matrix, they need efficient assets like ours to continue supporting the country's energy grid at attractive price levels.</p><p><strong>Royal Vopak acquired a 49% equity stake in the Sociedad Portuaria el Cayao (SPEC) LNG import facility partnership and operation. What does this say about the international attention currently focused on Colombia's natural gas industry?<br></strong>Because Colombia has a regasification facility, we are on the map for the international energy markets. Given the diminishing local gas production capability until Colombia develops additional local gas supply capabilities, we will need to connect to and supply our needs from these international markets. Royal Vopak is an internationally renowned player, and it is a positive sign that international markets are interested in developing meaningful relationships with Colombia.</p><p><strong>What are TEBSA's main goals and milestones for 2019-2020?<br></strong>In terms of 2019, TEBSA is currently undergoing an extensive maintenance program for all its units, including completely overhauling one of its steam turbines. We are also finalizing that same process for two gas turbines, where we are implementing a new state-of-the-art control system. We are currently seeing lower-than-normal inflows of water into Colombia's reservoirs, so our plant has been providing a significant amount of energy not only to the Caribbean region, but also to the country's interior. In 2020, we will continue with our schedule of overhauling seven gas turbines, with two in 2020 and three the following year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[                                    <p><strong>How do you assess the evolution and success of Expro's projects over its four years of experience providing services, particularly to offshore exploration, in the Colombian market?<br></strong>Expro is a major company that has been growing via more acquisitions over the last four years. We are looking to open new business lines in different countries. Colombia has always been a target market for Expro because the company management knows there are many opportunities here, even in offshore. However, offshore is just starting out in Colombia, and we are looking at participating in these projects. We are being proactive and aligning ourselves with Ecopetrol to bring new technologies and become a major part of helping it determine the best way to drill new wells and deliver the final product. Colombia's offshore is more focused on gas production, and the country needs to look for more fields to continue growing and increase its gas production. However, we are having some issues in developing the offshore. The main problem in Colombia today is the licensing regime; currently, it is not easy to get a license because the plan for offshore is for 2021, so it will take more time before licenses are issued.</p><p><strong>What collaborations has Expro been working on in Colombia with Ecopetrol and private companies, and what opportunities do you see for your services going forward?</strong><br>Colombia is a different market, and if operators want to acquire a field, there are different processes compared to most countries. Colombia's oil production is increasing again, which is good because it shows the oil industry is active. However, it has been somewhat quiet to date because of low oil prices and companies waiting for a solid economic outlook before they invest. 2020 will be the year for companies to invest more. They are currently preparing for the processes they will have to go through in 2020-2021. For 2021, the plan is to invest almost USD10 million in Colombia. In terms of what is happening today, Ecopetrol has specific partnerships for Colombia's main fields with companies like Frontera Energy and Hocol, which is the right arm of Ecopetrol. Ecopetrol has also acquired 100% of its biggest partner, Acción. Furthermore, Ecopetrol has strong connections with Perenco, Frontera Energy, and Parex Resources. The other exploration company that is growing strongly in Colombia is Geopark. These are the clients we need to focus on.</p><p><strong>How has Expro continued to deliver services in its main areas of expertise such as sub-sea development, product optimization, and well abandonment?</strong><br>Colombia is looking to increase its production. However, this is not easy to do here, and Ecopetrol needs a great deal of help because it has specific fields it receives all its production from. It needs to increase this capacity, so production is still the main market for Expro. However, Expro is strong in offshore where we can deploy our subsea technology and as we know offshore is the future in terms of gas, Expro is really focused on this side of the market. Unconventional wells are another area of opportunity for Expro to show clients that we are here and have the capabilities to perform all jobs.</p><p><strong>How is Expro demonstrating it has the knowledge to tackle unconventional wells once these projects kick off in Colombia?<br></strong>The process is not easy in Colombia. For example, for a new company that wants to enter the Colombian market, it is difficult to gain contracts because all local companies ask about its experience in Colombia. Expro seeks to show potential clients its background and expertise. We have over 40 years' global experience in the field and the technology and capabilities to deliver whatever is needed to support exploration in Colombia. The most important point is to stay in contact with one's clients. You need to be there at the right place and the right time. </p>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How does Kodiak's 23 years of experience translate into its added value offering to companies, and how important is the Colombian market for your portfolio?<br></strong>For us, diversity in services and working with different cultures in many countries allows us to fit in with the culture. We train our people in a more effective way to complement our personalized services. We can respond to clients much faster than larger service companies. We make decisions quickly and do not have that massive bureaucracy. Our people come from the field, so they have the technical experience; anyone at any level can answer questions directly to get things moving. This is important in Colombia, which is a focal point for us. The market has turned around, and the potential is enticing. Colombia is number one on our radar for the next two to three years. Other countries are of interest, but it is too soon. We were present at the 2019 Oil and Gas Congress in Colombia, which seemed significantly more positive than previous ones. There was much more optimism. Key people from oil companies actually went out of their way to make inquiries into our services and proposition; the operators are really opening their doors to other opportunities or ways to do business. There is real opportunity for growth with these companies.</p><p><strong>What is your client portfolio like in Colombia, and how do you plan to reach new customers?<br></strong>We work for pretty much everyone, and our portfolio is decent. We have struggled to get in with Ecopetrol due to timing of contracts. In 2020, more contracts are coming up, and we will participate in those bidding rounds. We will continue to focus on specialty services and optimization of procedures. Many times, in Colombia, things have been done the same way for a long period of time. There are new procedures now that can minimize costs and optimize the turnaround times on wells. That will increase profits and get wells back online faster. We also like to train local qualified people. When these projects are started, experts need to be brought in to oversee the processes. At some point, we will have a few expatriates overseeing operations, with everyone else being local.</p><p><strong>What key aspects allow you to offer solutions that optimize the success of exploration, completion, and production of oil and gas wells?</strong><br>Experience is certainly one, but certain specialty services are also important. We can plug abandonments without pulling tubing, for example. There are different ways in which we can provide solutions that are much more cost effective. We like to keep a solid inventory of tools that people normally do not have locally and want to prevent downtime at the rigs. We have a special license for non-explosive cutting tools for pipe and do not need to wait for military approval to move explosives. We can move in five minutes.</p><p><strong>How easy has it been to work with the large players of Colombia, considering the complex geography?<br></strong>You need to approach every area differently. We have worked in every corner of Colombia in the last seven years. We have acquired great experience. We have operating bases in Aguachica, Villagarzón, and Cota and are adding another one in Yopal. We have worked on wells in all these areas, and each has been completely different. Different people are needed on each site. Moving equipment can be difficult at times, which is one of the reasons we do the satellite bases. We want to service clients and have decent response times. Colombia is a small country; however, traveling within the country takes a long time. That is why equipment needs to be strategically placed in the right areas to avoid downtimes. It also helps with security and people. The potential within the regions depends on the clients and their focuses. We are fortunate to have enough clients that we can stay busy in most areas. Another of our advantages is the presence of Canadian and US companies here. They trust our experience, and we speak the same language. We have a slight advantage with the Canadian oil companies for that reason. If they have a problem in a well, generally they only call us.</p><p><strong>There are many projects in the Gulf of Mexico, Brazil, and the Colombian Caribbean with offshore exploration. How can that positively impact operations?</strong><br>We focus on land other than our fluids management division. That side already looked after the fluids engineering, solids control and waste management on the Anadarko offshore in Colombia a few years ago, and we plan to get back out there. Generally, it takes 18-24 months to bring those wells online. The long-term issue could be if they had huge success, and there was a great deal of oil. Below USD50, Colombia is not the greatest place, which is true of most places. Ideally, USD70 per oil barrel is the best for everyone; let us hope that we get there. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[for-the-benefit-of-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Ecopetrol's role and relevance for the Colombian economy?<br></strong>Ecopetrol generates impact in many ways. For example, in Colombia, we operate in 337 municipalities, a large part of the country, and we have been present in most of these places for decades. Each peso we invest in a municipality has the potential to multiply in the regions where we operate. For example, in 2019 Ecopetrol increased local procurement of goods and services by 6% to COP7.2 billion, clearly energizing regional economies. Ecopetrol also contributes through taxes and dividends to shareholders. In 2019, Ecopetrol Group contributed COP26.3 billion to the nation, in the last 10 years contributing over COP230 billion. Additionally, we have close to 260 direct shareholders, and more than 16 million Colombians have part of their savings in the company through pension funds and severance payments.</p><p><strong>What have been the main drivers of Ecopetrol's growth in recent years?<br></strong>Our business plan is based on three fundamental pillars: growth of reserves and production, protection of the cash flow, and cost efficiency with strict capital discipline. Today, more than ever, capital discipline allows us to carefully analyze where we place every dollar and ensure that it gives Ecopetrol the expected profit. For the past five years, we have focused on developing a robust transformation plan accounts approximately to COP13 billion in productivity improvements and reduced cost structures and has enabled us to better withstand industry volatility. Our vision is to continue to be efficient. We are well positioned in the region; we have a reputation for being flexible and agile and for being able to transform ourselves.</p><p><strong>The National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) has assigned new blocks in Colombia. How does that impact Ecopetrol's and Colombia's exploration and production activity?</strong><br>For us, Colombia continues to be the focus of our investments. In fact, in 2019/2020 about 80% of such investments will be allocated to projects in the country. Our country still has great potential to explore and find new hydrocarbon reserves, both in the mainland and offshore. During the second cycle of the area allocation process carried out by ANH in 2019, we presented the best offers for five blocks. These blocks that we are bidding on will strengthen our portfolio in Colombia. We hope they will translate into new jobs, more barrels, and additional resources for the benefit of all Colombians.</p><p><strong>There is growing interest in Colombia for the development of fracking. How does Ecopetrol evaluate this potential, and how will it enter the market?</strong><br>If we can extract hydrocarbons from unconventional reserves, we can have oil reserves that can last up to 30 years and gas reserves that could last 50. The Council of State has allowed pilot research projects to be carried out. Ecopetrol is working on the planning and careful design of these pilots because it is not about doing things quickly, but about doing them well. The fracking pilot projects will work like a fish tank. Anyone will be able to look inside to understand how we operate in areas such as sustainability or water management. That way, the country can make a decision based on facts.</p><p><strong>What is the plan to develop a strong downstream sector that can support Colombia's diversification efforts?<br></strong>In our business plan 2020-2022, we will allocate about 11% to the downstream activities, focused on the use and optimization of the current infrastructure. One of the most relevant projects that will allow us to continue delivering high value, and above all excellent quality fuels in terms of lower sulfur content, is the interconnection of the original unit with the new Cartagena refinery. An expansion of the Esenttia plant, a subsidiary of the Ecopetrol Group, that is dedicated to the production of polypropylene, is also planned.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Responsible mining]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[responsible-mining]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the potential of responsible mining and modern mining processes in Colombia?<br></strong>At AngloGold Ashanti, every mining project should deliver economic, environmental, and social benefits. Through responsible mining practices, companies can create community development programs, take proactive measures to preserve the environment, and promote gender equality to empower local communities and enable them to benefit more from mining activities. Responsible mining would also engage the use of automated equipment and digitalization to optimize efficiencies, reduce emissions, and provide an inherently safer working environment.</p><p><strong>How is AngloGold Ashanti positioned in Colombia's mining industry?<br></strong>AngloGold Ashanti is the largest explorer in Colombia. We manage the three biggest projects in the country; two of them, Gramalote and Quebradona, are categorized as projects of national strategic interest. In 2019, La Colosa was the third such project in our portfolio, but we have since reached a non-formal agreement with the government and local community to halt its development. The two biggest projects we are working on are both located in Antioquia. While Gramalote is an open-pit, low-grade gold mine, Quebradona is an underground mine with higher quality gold (20%) and copper (80%) deposits.</p><p><strong>What is it like operating in Colombia?<br></strong>It all depends on the regional jurisdiction the company is located in. Some areas are easier to navigate than others, mainly based on the local understanding of mining and their past experience of mining, in addition to the outlook of the public sector. Having a successful operation can demonstrate the benefits and success that local mining can bring to communities, particularly to those who have concerns. Overall, the situation in Colombia as a whole is improving. All the relevant authorities are working on policies and the regulatory framework so that mining in the country is sustainable. Community and local engagement are critical to mining in any location.</p><p><strong>What are the company's plans for the Gramalote and Quebradona projects?<br></strong>We have acquired the license for the Gramalote mine and are planning to present the feasibility study to our different boards—B2Gold is a partner and manages the project—early in 2021. Assuming the board approves it, we aim to start building it by mid-2021. We are still working on the license for the Quebradona project and aim to also present the feasibility study to our board in 1Q2021. Our company has an investment return hurdle of 15% for new projects.</p><p><strong>How is the company planning to generate benefits for local communities?<br></strong>Quebradona is our flagship project, and we want to use it as a model of responsible mining. So far, we have held 160-170 public hearings with more than 3,000 members of local communities. Our main goal is to transform the underground wealth into social benefits. We propose to build the mine in a 2,500-ha biodynamic park. Our idea is to make the park self-sustainable. To that end, we will generate solar energy and create spaces for businesses. The park will be managed by a third party, and the profits will go to local communities. The mine itself will have a huge economic impact in terms of royalties, taxes, and jobs. The foundation will receive a minimum of USD2 million. If we sell more, the foundation will receive more. This foundation is separate from our social corporate responsibility projects. The foundation will be 100% managed by people from Jericó, Antioquia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[energy-transformation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been your main focus areas and achievements during this administration?<br></strong>Colombia's electricity generation matrix is one of the cleanest in the world. Nearly 70% of the electricity that Colombians consume is generated through hydropower, while 30% is generated through thermoelectric plants. At the same time, we have an objective to reduce our CO2 emissions by 11.2 million tons through 2030. Over the last 19 months in government, Colombia has taken very important steps for our energy transition and speeding up the use of non-conventional renewable sources. This will allow us to provide cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable energy for Colombians while at the same time continuing to close the existing inequality gaps.</p><p>How relevant will clean energy resources be for future energy generation in Colombia?<br>Electricity, specially generated through non-conventional renewable sources, and natural gas will continue to be the drivers of Colombia's energy transformation. That's envisioned in the National Energy Plan, a tool developed by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), which presents possible future supply and demand scenarios in the country through 2050. According to the UPME report, electricity and natural gas demand will surpass that of liquid fuels. Currently, nearly 48% of the energy consumed in the country are liquid fuels, while natural gas and electricity represent 30%. According to our estimates, in 2050 that participation will reverse: natural gas and electricity demand will be of 46%, while that of liquid fuels will near 36%. Colombia, particularly the Caribbean region, has a huge potential for energy generation through non-conventional sources. Wind speed in La Guajira is twice as much the global average, while solar radiation there is 60% higher.</p><p><strong>What actions can be taken by the government to further promote development of renewable energy resources?<br></strong>Energy transition in Colombia is a reality. The country has taken a historical leap toward renewable energies, which will allow us to generate more than 12% of our electricity from solar and wind power by 2022. We will go from having less than 50MW of installed capacity for solar and wind generation, which are equivalent to the capacity that a city the size of Ibague requires, to more than 2,500MW in 2022, which the amount collectively needed by cities such as Cali, Medellí­n, Bucaramanga, Barranquilla, and Cartagena. That will be achieved through 14 generation megaprojects, reducing CO2 emissions by 9 million tons, attracting over COP8 trillion in investment, more than 6,000 jobs, and a 30% reduction in electricity rates for consumers.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do comprehensive research pilot projects (PPII) represent for Colombia?<br></strong>PPIIs are an experimental and scientific process that will be developed to evaluate the effects of techniques with horizontal drilling for non-conventional fields. If these projects are successful and these resources could be further developed, experts estimate there could be between 35 and 50 additional years of gas reserves and 15 more for oil. No other source has such potential levels.</p><p><strong>What role do you envision the energy and mining sectors playing in the future of Colombia's economy?<br></strong>The mining-energy sector is an important revenue source for the country; 7% of the country's GDP corresponds to mining, hydrocarbon, and energy activities, and 12% of the current income for the country between 2015 and 2018 were generated through oil revenues. Nearly 38% of the FDI in the country is related to that industry, and 56% of the exports in Colombia in 2019 correspond to mining-energy resources. Additionally, the sector provides resources that boost economic and social development in regions, through the general royalty system, which for 2019 and 2020 totaled COP24.2 trillion, which is the highest amount since its creation in 2012.</p><p><strong>What are the priorities of the ministry moving forward?<br></strong>Our goal is to achieve a more efficient, reliable, and sustainable energy service. The experts of the Energy Transformation Mission have delivered a number of recommendations to our country, which are focused such issues as achieving a higher reliability in the energy supply for all Colombians at more efficient prices and increasing the offer and demand of natural gas by increasing the participation of generation plants, which currently has a participation of less than 12%. Other focuses include empowering energy users through the introduction of technologies, like smart meters, which will allow to make better decisions around consumption, control spending, or concerning the environment, and further focusing on energy subsidies. This, could contribute toward closing equity gaps and bring energy to more than 500,000 families who do not currently have access. In 2019, we connected more than 27,000 of these families to electric power for the first time, and our  goal is to connect at least 100,000 families. Finally, we must strengthen and modernize the institutions and companies in the sector and achieve a higher level of coordination, which will allow us to respond to the new challenges in the electricity sector. Through these initiatives, the national government is working to develop a transformation roadmap that takes into account the expert recommendations, unions, businesses, and other players in the energy sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In which sectors of the economy do you work?<br></strong>Equitel is a holding with seven different companies. We are in technology, energy, transportation, and just about every segment. We supply the health sector, mining companies, oil companies, industry, and transportation fleets.</p><p><strong>Which activities generate the most activity?<br></strong>Our main supplier is a multinational energy company with a large presence. We have 80% penetration of Colombia's heavy-duty truck industry. We represent income all over the country, except for the oil business. We are in the genset and engine business, including repair. Our growth so far has been organic; we have managed to multiply by 40 without acquiring companies or bringing in investors. We created a technology company where we created our own platform, which means we can diagnose engines and gensets virtually. We have our own managing center. We monitor around 3,600 engines all over Colombia that we see every 30 seconds. We can diagnose an engine from anywhere, even across borders. However, our main business is to develop people. The second objective is customer productivity. It is why we created a technology company, an energy product company, a fluid administration company for large engines, and our own lubricant plant. We even created our own consulting company to help transform other companies' culture.</p><p><strong>Equitel has been a pioneer of innovative workplace culture. How did this start, and how has it transformed your company so far?<br></strong>The company started in 1959. When I came back from the US, my father wanted me to work with him. I set up some companies and fell in love with this company. After 10 years, we were ready to transform and do something else. I admire my father very much; he was a brilliant and successful entrepreneur. When I asked to go in a new direction and to step aside, he accepted. We wanted to leave behind the company's mindset and enter a new culture. Culture is about company behavior. We started this new process in 1995. It was about having people engaged and happy. You must convert the supply chain of your customers into a value chain through the effort of your company. When trying to sell a product or a service, the first thing one does is tell the client how marvelous the company is, how great the products are, and how amazing the infrastructure is. However, clients are not interested in that. When the language is not just about you, but your customer's customer, and when you are able to visualize, learn, and understand their language and speak it, it is a valuable relationship. Your purpose is the consequence of their purpose.</p><p><strong>How have you helped spread this culture to other companies?<br></strong>At first, it was extremely difficult. To make it clear and create new protocols, we held a goodbye party for the old culture and a welcome party for the new culture. We started strong; our promise was to never give up or stop, be persistent, and never look back. After a while, we managed to organize everything. Now, we can explain the entire culture in a simple way. Universities and institutions started reaching out to us, and I now give 40 talks annually about our culture. I even gave a TED Talk on our culture. Today, we are in the process of transforming 37 companies, which is amazing. To change the world, you have to do it day by day, company by company. Our purpose of changing this country is to be generous and open. We want to create abundance so we can approach clients with more tools and possibilities. We want every company to do well, even our competitors, so we can create abundance. If companies are structuring themselves to give their people a purpose and not simply see them as resources, we can begin to change. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the reasons behind the agreement to set up the Dentons and Cardenas &amp; Cardenas union?<br></strong>Competition has always been active in Colombia in the legal sector, and there were many international firms opening locations in Colombia; we concluded that the trend in the legal services market was the globalization of legal firms. Dentons offered a presence in a large number of countries, with the promise to increase its presence in more countries including throughout Latin America. Now, it covers 75 countries and 180 cities around the world. We currently have great coverage in Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil. Essentially, as a local independent firm, we needed to evolve a global footprint. Legal services are handled by high-level international firms with expertise not only in one place but worldwide. As a result, we have grown. We receive a great deal of work from Dentons offices worldwide, and we have benefited from best practices and state-of-the-art technology. We are 12,000 lawyers pushing the same name worldwide. Competition in Colombia with international firms continues to grow, and it will continue to do so. We have to be at the forefront of the market.<br><br><strong>How important are activities in Colombia for Dentons?<br></strong>Having a footprint in Colombia is important because the Colombian economy is currently the showcase of Latin American economies. Dentons' global plan is to have a presence in many countries, and a presence in Latin America is vital for this plan. Each time we add a country in Latin America, we acquire greater  importance within the Dentons organization and the region.</p><p><strong>What are your objectives for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>The objective is to continue growing, hopefully into more areas of practice, and open one or two offices in other Colombian cities. We are looking at Barranquilla, Medellí­n, and Cali. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As you were newly appointed in September 2019, what is the new direction that you will bring to Portafolio?<br></strong>I entered Portafolio's newsroom with one main goal: to keep our newspaper as Colombia's leading business publication. These are hard times for not only print media but also journalism as a whole. Technological changes, the appeal of fake news and misinformation, and the legitimacy crisis facing institutions like legacy media, are undermining the cornerstones of journalism in contemporary societies: trust, credibility, and fact-based reporting.</p><p><strong>What are the main goals and objectives of the publication? <br></strong>Portafolio is a three-pronged institution: a professional newsroom, a committed commercial team, and management team. Each one of these three has clear objectives to accomplish. Our newsroom must maintain the quality of our content for our audiences, our readership, and our social networks' users and followers. Portafolio's commercial team works creatively in search of new and appealing formats for our advertisers and partners. Management balances the requirements and needs of these teams to keep our business healthy.</p><p><strong>What are the main types of news in the Colombian market? <br></strong>The Colombian news market is not homogeneous and is digital. It also has a wide array of journalistic formats with good reception among the public: newspapers, magazines, radio morning news broadcasts, radio afternoon shows, radio evening shows, TV newscasts, websites, Twitter accounts, and YouTube channels focusing on political news and opinion.</p><p><strong>How does your newspaper keep itself at the top of the competition?<br></strong>Portafolio is focused on economics and business news. We are concentrated in this niche audience and always trying to expand it, appeal to new readers, and to understand what readers want to know about our economy and business environment. We combine our 26 years of journalistic tradition and experience with the ability to adapt to Colombia's ever-changing business environment to stay on top.</p><p><strong>How is Portafolio covering the news regarding the coronavirus?<br></strong>The COVID-19 pandemic, along with the strategies deployed against the virus, have triggered several crises: a public health crisis, an economic crisis, and a political crisis. In applying drastic health measures, economies have practically closed down. Globally, we are experiencing a major economic downturn, even worse than the 2008 financial crisis. Our newsroom is covering these three faces of the pandemic: the brutal shock to major sectors of Colombian and Latin American economies, the untested strategies health authorities are deploying against COVID-19, including testing and hospital preparation, and the political battle within our country and democratic system that has been unleashed by social tensions.   </p><p><strong>Do you work together with other media outlets to keep the population informed? <br></strong>Portafolio is part of a publishing company called El Tiempo, which has a namesake newspaper, a local TV channel, and several magazines. We work closely, especially in our digital sites, to combine our resources to generate better, higher-quality content. </p><p><strong>How challenging is it to maintain a diversified range of news, especially in these difficult times? <br></strong>It is definitively a challenge to keep a diversified range of news, but our coverage is oriented to provide news and content from a constantly evolving business environment. As a middle-income country, Colombia is experiencing a surge and consolidation of new business sectors in energy, technology, cannabis, e-commerce, and others. The government is also facing new challenges in terms of policy, regulation, and intervention in areas such as apps, privacy, and telecoms. Our goal is to maintain a first-rate coverage of these tensions and realignments among the government, businesses, and society. </p><p><strong>What are the plans and expectations for Portafolio in 2020? <br></strong>The current pandemic has changed most plans we had for 2020, but our goals hold: keeping up our leadership role in Colombian business publications via premium content about business and the economy; strengthening our digital presence and social network marketing strategy; and developing creative formats for advertisers and partners. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been some of your achievements?<br></strong>In 13 years, we have contributed to more than 350 investment projects to Bogotá, resulting in 30,000 direct jobs and over USD2.5 billion in new investments. Soon, we will hit 50 projects a year. When we started, there were 600 companies with foreign capital; now, there are close to 1,600 companies. We are always looking for new ways to contribute with productive employment and transformation to the city's business sector.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for the short and medium term?<br></strong>We are betting on three areas. One is entrepreneurship; we are developing an entire strategy to make Bogotá the capital of entrepreneurship in Latin America. This includes looking for new investment sources, attracting international entrepreneurs to settle in Bogotá, and, above all, promoting and attracting new venture capital funds. A great example is Rappi, which received USD1 billion from the Japanese investment fund Softbank, which has also installed its headquarters in Bogotá. Another important driver is strengthening our human talent. We are developing a project on bilingualism together with Fedesarrollo, where we seek to analyze and generate concrete actions to attract more employees to our industries. With the commercial environment established by US-China relations, there is huge potential to attract new US and European investments.</p><p><strong>The IT and BPO sectors in Latin America are blooming, representing 7.5% of employment in Bogotá. How will this sector continue to contribute to the economy?</strong><br>Bogotá is a strong city in terms of services; 62% of the city's GDP comprises services. A substantial amount of employment is generated by that sector; however, if we had more human resources in the software programming area, we could have more companies, or we could see existing companies continue to grow. In addition, we are developing initiatives to boost women's participation in programming. Additionally, we are holding boot camps to run pilot tests and rapidly develop talent for the female sector. This is a city with a young population, which gives companies the assurance that there are human resources available locally in the long run. There is an opportunity to continue growing, and the service sector and creative industries will be important in the field.</p><p><strong>Now that the government is focused on promoting the orange economy, how will this strengthen the business environment in the city?</strong><br>If one looks at the number of audiovisual companies in Colombia, 75% are in Bogotá. We are betting extensively on it because the sector has real incentives and an agreement with Bogotá for the development of creative industries. It is already a powerful sector that generates many export products because our content generation is not just for the local market but also for exports. Bogotá, a mega city with around 10 million inhabitants with growing income per capita and recent growth exceeding 3%, is attractive to world-class companies that will continue to arrive to strengthen the entire ecosystem. In the audiovisual field, our biggest competitors are Mexico and Argentina. Bogotá and Colombia are up to the task of surpassing them in terms of importance and the number of companies that arrive here. </p><p><strong>What other sectors do you plan to develop this year and the next?<br></strong>We are looking at five services sectors that generate value. One is the city's infrastructure, which we need to enhance. This administration advanced significantly here, though there is still a great deal of room to improve. Foreign investment plays an important role, as do PPPs in healthcare, wastewater, and treatment plants, as well as public buildings that must be built and technologies that have to be invested in. In manufacturing, apart from those of added value, we are making a commitment in life sciences, including the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and medical device sectors. Furthermore, we are promoting clinical tests in Bogotá so drug companies take advantage of our resources in biodiversity to develop new pharmaceuticals, alternative medicines, and so on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role do creative industries play in the Colombian economy today?<br></strong>A strategy the government seeks to develop is taking advantage of one of the most important assets we have as a country: our human talent. Colombia has the second-youngest population in Latin America, and a great deal of entrepreneurial spirit. President Iván Duque has been developing and encouraging the orange economy, which perfectly matches with the idea of a creative economy. Creative economy includes those economic sectors traditionally related to human talent and culture that now deliver more added value based on creativity and innovation. In Colombia, that represents around 1.8% of our GDP. However, in countries such as the UK and the Netherlands, that participation is close to 10%. Our goal is to move from 1.8% and get close to a 5% contribution to GDP. To reach that level of participation, we need to strengthen our institutions, boost the country's industry, and ensure that we have an inclusive sector that develops and supports inspiration. We want to develop more incentives such as a 0% income tax rate for the next seven years for this sector. We are also extending existing incentives; for example, we will improve the production of not only films, but also television series, videos, and other media related to the creative economy. Today, this sector, which includes music, arts, theater, architecture, design, audiovisual, and games, is becoming a relevant sector for the country's future. It may not be the most important one, but it will be quite relevant and strategic.</p><p><strong>What benefits will be created with the Sustainable Trade Program that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism has agreed with the EU?</strong><br>The main actor in this process is the Ministry of Culture through the Vice-Ministry of Creativity. Our role is to provide the infrastructure and especially financial access. This is why we issued orange bonds over 2019 to attract investment from around the world from different institutions to have enough money to offer a generous amount of loans for the sector. We issued bonds of almost USD150 million, which are already fully subscribed. The sector is taking advantage of this amount of money and using it for its future. The creative economy is a great opportunity to increase Colombia's export services. Over the last four years, export services from Colombia has reached almost double-digit growth. In March 2020, we launched a new program funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) where we will develop policies, strategies, and tactics to increase service exports, including the orange economy. We are also working with the EU on cooperation methods to develop the creative economy concept.<br><br><strong>What is the ministry's position on moving through the process and becoming part of the OECD?<br></strong>We are committed to the OECD and the internal work that we must get done is mostly about strengthening our institutionality in order to seek a position for Colombia as an active member. Since before being accepted as members of the OECD, we have been working on the necessary internal adjustments to be able to reach the required international standards, which we will undoubtedly continue to improve with our full admission to this exclusive group of countries. It is the scenario in which the country can measure and compare itself with its peers, evaluate its context, and accurately identify the fields where we can improve, promoting public policies that meet high standards and that lead us to improved transparency in every single action we take, a flagship crusade in Colombia. All these efforts probably will result in more equity, more employment, and better quality of life for citizens. Compliance and "vigilance" for these standards creates certainty and predictability for productive sectors, investors, and the work of public officials. The active participation of the country in the OECD will allow for greater work spaces and for solving joint problems with other members, which are currently Colombia's main trading partners. In particular, as a full member of the OECD, you can use your resources and participate in different discussions to constantly evaluate and improve the country's public policies, meet your challenges, and achieve the country's goals more quickly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Moreover, we are working to be an environmentally friendly company to raise awareness among industrialists and workers on everything related to environmental care. For ZFO, this is an essential topic. Furthermore, we aim to manage and treat domestic wastewater, use recyclable waste, exploit rainwater through a buffer lagoon, and launch energy efficiency projects. In addition, we are also working with entrepreneurs to establish the first solar panel factory with state-of-the-art technology for clean energy projects and with a circular economy production process. This will not only generate investment for the country, but also increase employment rates for the less privileged and offer training.</p><p><strong>What is the role of free zones face in terms of the use of renewable energy tools?<br></strong>This is already the tendency in the energy sector; it is important to use renewable and friendly tools to positively impact the environment. For industries, renewable energy tools have lower energy costs and make companies more competitive in the national and international market. We also have strategic allies and partners that support the energy requirements that each industry requires. We need to ensure an excellent service while optimizing the practices of the main industries located in our free zone. This is how we offer expertise in this matter, which is a vital part of the companies set up here. We are focused on ensuring that the investment is optimized, while we reinvent ourselves every day in favor of economic trends that benefit our main investors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>President Filipe Nyusi has called on the private sector to join forces with the government to improve the investment environment in the country. As one of the largest private sector groups in Mozambique, how does MHL contribute to this goal?</h4><p><span></span>When we talk about business environment and wealth creation in the Mozambican context, there are two dimensions to it. On one side, the creation of economic infrastructure, banking, insurance, roads, bridges, transport, energy and transmission, basic healthcare, and so on, which have little short-term return, have to be state sponsored, and be part of the development plan of the government. On the other, business ventures in agricultural, industrial, and services sector led by the private or entrepreneurial sector feature adequate returns to be economically viable in the short term. The creation of adequate infrastructure and business environment are essential to support corporate and entrepreneurial investment in market-based business activities. Within the constraints related to infrastructure, we have been successfully setting up and managing production facilities in agriculture, water resources development, pharma, healthcare, and others, employing over 1,600 Mozambicans and aligning ourselves with state development plans in priority sectors. Agriculture, energy, and industrialization are some of the pillars of the National Development Strategy 2015-2035 that aims to foster the transformation of the country into a middle-income nation. MHL is present in all of those, generating jobs and pushing the economy forward.</p><h4>What recent investments has the company committed to these sectors?</h4><p><span></span>We have introduced rubber production as a pilot project in Lugela, Zambezia, initially for 2,000ha, with 1,000ha already planted. We have 14 drilling teams engaged in water resources development in Sofala, Manica, Zambezia, Nampula, and Cabo Delgado, initially in potable water in rural and semi urban areas and subsequently in irrigation. We have set up the largest generic pharma production facility in Africa with compliance approvals from WHO and Mozambique Regulatory Authority and have been in production for the last two years. We have created hydropower production at Pequenos Libombos dam. We have great potential for growth in our current areas of operations and where we have developed skills. Hence, our short- and medium-term focus is to complete the rubber cultivation as per plan and commence production and add on a second crop like cashew that does not require as much intensive monitoring; use our experience and expertise in water drilling to create irrigation facilities for small and medium-scale farms; and  expand manufacturing of generic pharma products by setting up IV fluid and injectable factories to comprehensively address the national pharma requirement at international-quality standards and at prices accessible to most Mozambicans.</p><h4>What are the expected impacts of the upcoming investments in oil and gas in the coming years? How will MHL capitalize on these investments?</h4><p><span></span>Other than job creation and ancillary entrepreneurial opportunities, which are localized, the greater impact of oil and gas is in the income accruals to the government exchequer, which will enable the government to implement the infrastructure development plan. This will have a multiplier effect by fast tracking corporate and entrepreneurial investments in wealth creation, making it easier for MHL to progress with its rural and semi-urban agenda by increasing people's purchasing power and market expansion for local products.</p><h4>You shared a big portion of your career with Mozambicans. How would you define your relationship with the country and its people?</h4><p><span></span>We have been in Mozambique for 30 years, and this country has sustained and nourished us through this long haul. This assistance was essential in the initial difficult phases. Now, in gratitude, we reciprocate. Mozambique's ethos and cultural psyche evolved around its ethnic and cultural diversity. This welcomed Arab, Portuguese, Indian, and African settlers and transformed the country in a peaceful and positive way. We have evolved our own Mozambican persona in harmony with this ethnic and cultural diversity.</p><h4>What are your hopes for the future?</h4><p><span></span>President Nyusi has created new hope and positive energy among the people; the nation stands united across ethnic, cultural, and tribal divides and is in the process, as per his investiture address, of creating a government with fundamental attitudinal changes and technical skills to fast track the development effort. I hope he can create a sustainable business environment in the short and medium term so that Mozambicans become skilled, competent, productive people and learn to exploit their own vast natural resources and take a significant place in the history of humans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Santa Cruz Silver Mining been impacted by the pandemic?</h4><p><span></span>So far, none of our workers have been infected. New regulations are coming in and we have to comply with them. The mining sector in Mexico is very well regulated and organized, so for us it was easy to implement new health measures to halt the spread of COVID-19. We have a lot of experience in implementing different strategies across the industry. Notably, we had to halt our operations in Hidalgo because we are not generating enough revenue. Labor costs represent 45% of our total costs. Although we are not generating revenue, we had to pay our workers, which impacted our cash flow. Our plan is to reactivate mining operations in July. Mining is recognized as an essential activity by the government, but restarting mining operations takes time. We have some suppliers who are demanding late payments, and it will take us up to three months to catch up. Moreover, the CFE, the state-owned electric utility, wants us to continue paying our electricity bills. We are not receiving any government support to cope with this situation. We were awarded a 60-day moratorium on electricity payments, but it will expire in June. We did not generate revenue in May, so we are still in the same situation. I am thankful to the CFE for providing us with some time, but it is not enough. As for our workers, we have signed agreements to delay part of the payments and that has helped us. Overall, the biggest impact of the pandemic has been on our cash flow. On the positive side, the price of silver has increased from USD12/oz to USD17/oz in 2020.</p><h4>How close is the company to achieving its certification IRMA? </h4><p><span></span>IRMA stands for the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance and it stands out from other certifications such as the ESR, a certificate for Socially Responsible Companies in Mexico, by being much more comprehensive and focused on best practices. It helps increase trust among investors and employees. We are the only company in the continent working towards this certification. </p><h4>What was your main objective behind acquiring the Zimapan Mining assets from Grupo Peñoles in July? </h4><p><span></span>It is a transformational transaction for Santa Cruz to add the Zimapan mine to its portfolio. We have already had the privilege of working in this mine under a lease agreement with Minera Cedros.  This acquisition will help us towards our goal of becoming a mid-tier silver producer and we thank Peñoles for their support in this process. </p><h4>One of the few sectors that have experienced growth in Mexico is mining, according to the Mexican Institute of Statistics. What's your view on that? </h4><p><span></span>We do not compete with other companies for our product. When a price of a metal tanks, the only way to grow is by increasing production. The price of Zinc has started to increase, but it has not been enough. I do not actually follow many analysts because they are not able to explain what's happening and why prices of certain metals are ticking up. Gold prices increased because that metal is seen as a safe haven in times of turmoil. As for silver, we need prices to increase more in the short run. We have reduced zinc production at the Francisco Madero mine because we do not know exactly how the market will change in the future. I assume that some foreign companies will not restart their operations. Some will choose to downsize operations and some might decide to wrap up their operations in Mexico.</p><h4>What will push some companies to leave?</h4><p><span></span>It could be because of the context. A number of issues have impacted Mexico's mining sector, and the pandemic is one reason that can push some companies to decide against resuming operations.</p><h4>Is Santa Cruz Silver Mining planning to increase production in order to recover some of the losses it incurred after the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p><span></span>We will increase production if we can get more investment. For now, I just want to generate cash flow to survive through 2021. As for 2020, we are already halfway through and it has had a big impact on us. As of now, the chances of securing new funds are low. People who manage funds are not investing because they do not know what's going to happen. With this in mind, our strategy is to survive. </p><h4>What initiatives is the mining association evaluating?</h4><p><span></span>In the recent past, the association fought hard to make the government recognize mining as an essential industry. We fought for it daily and successfully achieved it, but I think it was a little too late. The protocols set to initiate operations in the Zacatecas state are tricky. We have to sign protocols and be careful. The problem is that there is a lot of talk and not enough action. Personally, I do not think any other industry in Mexico is organizing itself like we are to reactivate our activities. On the other hand, some industries, such as automotive, were able to continue working.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the INP's mandate?</h4><p><span></span>The INP is a public institution with patrimonial, financial, and administrative autonomy. It was created in 2004 as a regulatory body for the petroleum upstream sector. Its mandate comprises the whole upstream value chain, including promotion, licensing, contract negotiation, contract monitoring, research, production, and development of the petroleum sector through processing, liquefaction of gas, and transportation. </p><h4>How has the upstream sector in Mozambique evolved during the INP's lifetime? </h4><p><span></span>At first, the INP was a fairly small institution, primarily concerned with the management of the Pande and Temane gas fields in Inhambane province, where extraction activities started in 2004 by the South African company Sasol. Although this was the only ongoing approved project with limited reserves (gas resources) at the time, the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (MIREME) always believed that the country had a higher potential for hydrocarbon exploration elsewhere in the country. We put a lot of effort to attract foreign investments and were finally able to launch a tender in 2005 for the licensing of the areas of the Rovuma Offshore Basin, attracting international oil companies such as Anadarko, Eni, Artumas, and Norsk Hydro (now Statoil/Equinor). In 2010, Total (former Anadarko) made the first discovery of the Windjammer field, soon followed by the huge findings at Area 1 and Area 4 also by Eni of the Mamba field and Coral field. The 2020 marks the 10th anniversary of the first findings, which marks an historical and scientific milestone in the development of Mozambique petroleum sector. The discovery was considered as one of the most important gas discoveries in recent years. In 2014, a Decree Law was approved to allow and facilitate the development of Rovuma LNG projects. Back then, we thought that the project would be up and running by 2018. Unfortunately, the market conditions combined with price of petroleum which went down in 2014, and projects lost opportunities for that window. In-between, we realized that the only way to secure development in all areas would be to advance three projects: the Floating LNG (FLNG) plant in Coral Sul operated by Eni, the Golfinho-Atum project led by Total (previously Anadarko), and the Rovuma LNG project in Area 4 led by MRV (ENI, ExxonMobil and CNPC). While the initial investment was expected to be around USD10-15 billion, the combined investments of the three plants now add up to USD50 billion—an investment that will transform the country's economy within a few years.</p><h4>What is the deadline for implementation of the projects in the Rovuma Basin?</h4><p><span></span>The FLNG plant for the Coral Sul field is currently being constructed in South Korea. If everything goes according to plan, the platform will be transported to the country by the end of 2021 and production will start by the end of 2022. Work on the Golfinho-Atum project has just begun, but the contracted companies are already in the field. We expect to start production by the end of 2024. Work on the Rovuma LNG project will be the following as soon as the final investment decision is announced, which is expected by mid of 2020, and the first production in 2025. The expected output is 3.3 million tons from Coral Sul, 12 million tons from Golfinho-Atum, and 15 million tons from Rovuma LNG. All this will turn Mozambique from a small producer to a global exporter of liquefied gas. </p><h4>With production beginning in the Rovuma Basin, will the Pande and Temane fields gradually be phased out? </h4><p><span></span>Projects are designed for a shelf life of 25 years. 2020 will be the 16th year for Pande and Temane; the project has reached its peak and if there is no addition of new gas reserves, it is expected to gradually slow down production. However, the existence of gas and hydrocarbon is not an isolated phenomenon—it is a regional characteristic. So, there were investments made that led to finding other reserves in the area that could eventually lead to the extension of gas production in the area. However, these findings are not as large as Pande and Temane, and will be a fraction of Rovuma's output. Current production in Pande and Temane is about 150 million gigajoules (GJ), with 30% destined for local consumption and the rest exported to South Africa. </p><h4>What are your prospects for gas findings in other offshore areas?</h4><p>Since the Rovuma's discoveries, we have been assessing the country's potential in other areas. We signed contracts for areas in Angoche (5A and 5B) and Zambesi (5C and 5D), with ExxonMobil operating Angoche 5B and Zambezi 5C and 5D (with partners Rosneft, Qatar Petroleum and ENH) and ENI operating Angoche 5A (with Sasol, Qatar Petroleum and ENH). This is an assessment currently in progress so we expect the exploration wells to be done next year. According to our belief, we may at least eventually find more gas.</p><h4>What is the role of the INP in relation to transparency and local content?</h4><p><span></span>We make every effort to be transparent, starting with publishing all the contracts we have on our webpage. We disclose and advertise all the information in terms of existing reserves, production, gains, cost controls, and so on. With relation to the local content, this is one of the most important aspects that the government has been prioritizing. The Gas Master Plan states we should use these resources to leverage the country's industrial development. There is a provision in the petroleum laws that defines a specific amount of petroleum or gas resources that needs to be used for the national market; this will correspond to about 900 million cbft per day for the Rovuma projects. Moreover, the real value of the gas industry will come from generating employment, creating partnerships between local and foreign companies, and fostering the growth of the local economy. All companies operating in Mozambique must include a chapter in their development plan explaining how they are going to employ, train, and enable people from Mozambique's population.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why did you decide to invest in Aranda Software?<br></strong>Aranda emerged from four people in an apartment who were developing a software. I saw an opportunity to develop something myself, so I joined other partners in Colombia and invested to develop a product. We are a self-funded company with 140 workers and a presence in 10 countries in Latin America. We were established in Colombia and have great performance in the region. We are a great example of what President Duque wants for Colombia in terms of non-traditional industries like software.</p><p><strong>What value does Aranda Software provide?<br></strong>We help the project manager. This software is for IT people to ensure all their systems and processes are aligned, like support, human resources, marketing, and financials. We also provide advance notifications on possible errors and have a software for field workers. For example, we have a system called Angeles Azules that can geographically locate homeless people to provide them with social benefits. We have such an agreement with a government agency. Now, we will develop a program with Randstad that will implement our software. We are focused on banking and finance, government, and education, which represent 60% of our revenue.</p><p><strong>What is your main business and product?<br></strong>Our main product is the so-called help desk, a customer service for people with technical problems or any issue related to internal processes. This service desk works like a business process automation. We automatize processes used in many technologies, including accounting, marketing, and human resources, many of which AI and machine learning are extremely helpful with. We also have a program with Redeban, a company that attends to nearly 200,000 points of sale in Colombia and has 700 field workers. This field service software is useful for companies to manage their workers, but is a flexible program that can also help homeless people or technicians in the field. There are many segments that can be serviced, such as health, insurance, and telecommunications. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>In six years, Casacol has grown to become the largest property manager of furnished apartments in Medellí­n. What is the secret behind this breakthrough?<br></strong>Casacol is known for its condo hotels and furnished apartments. That said, we are interested in the entire hotel and tourism industry in Medellí­n. Our last two projects were boutique hotels, as will be our next three projects. We are diversifying slightly away from furnished apartments and condo hotels. We now serve more than 2,500 guests per month in Medellí­n. We send a survey to every guest and get hundreds of responses every month. They tell us what they liked and did not like about their stay, Medellí­n, and their trip to Colombia in general. We review this feedback weekly because it keeps us close to a real-time snapshot of what our customers think. For example, we recently got rid of all single-use amenity bottles for products like shampoo because of guests' comments. Historically, our guests have had many problems with transportation, both taxis and Uber. That led us to purchase and lease our own vehicles, and we now have a fleet of vehicles and drivers. Having our own fleet allows us to directly control customer experience.</p><p><strong>What is the industry's landscape like today, and what growth possibilities do you see?<br></strong>Casacol is the largest tourism operator by volume in Medellí­n. Therefore, we collect a great deal of data about our guests and constantly look at trends. Then, we make investments and project decisions to capture those trends. One example is that less than 1% of our guests were families around five years ago, though they now average 10%, in some months even closer to 20%. Families have specific needs, so we had to design products and services well suited to them. The future of tourism all across Colombia is incredibly bright, especially in Medellí­n, where YoY international arrivals are growing at the fastest rate in the country. The tourism landscape is also evolving quite dramatically based on demographics and global awareness of Colombia as a travel destination. For example, at present, millennials make up more than 60% of our guests, though starting in 2020, they will turn 40 years old. We must understand and adapt to that change. Some companies will embrace that change, and others will resist, and as with every other trend, there will be winners and losers.</p><p><strong>Casacol focuses on high net-worth investors. How do you attract them?<br></strong>Our only strategy is just to do a great job, create great investment opportunities, and offer great asset management services. High net-worth individuals typically know other high net-worth individuals, so word-of-mouth referrals from colleagues, friends, and family are an important part of our relationship with investors. One of the comments I receive constantly, especially from foreign real estate investors, is that their local property manager does not even do what Casacol is doing, and we are doing this in Colombia. That is important feedback for us because today investor capital is extremely global and will go to whichever place works the hardest and delivers the best returns. It is extremely important that we compete on a global scale, something Colombia needs to do as well.</p><p><strong>What can the government do to further boost the tourism sector?<br></strong>The tourism industry has contributed significantly to Colombia's GDP, especially over the last five years. And, this is without the government even trying hard. The biggest issue is that there are at least 10-12 different government entities spread across various areas of government that think tourism is their responsibility. However, no one is truly leading the effort to promote a global brand. If the government was to consolidate all these entities and put a true leader in place to build the Colombian brand and promote tourism, that would be an incredible first step. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is the company attractive for international suppliers who are interested in the Colombian market? <br></strong>For FIZA, the most important thing is service. The service department is our most flexible because there are many variables when speaking in terms of services for the client in our sector. We do not want to block their processes. When a customer buys a machine from FIZA, they need us to offer support. They buy production equipment, and when it stops for a few hours, customers lose large sums of money, which creates a bad image for end users. They are the ones who deliver the tracks, asphalt, or crushing equipment. At FIZA, we instill a culture of service in such a way that even sales increase due to our readiness. We do not talk about equipment but applications. FIZA is recognized for providing solutions with technology to customers in their applications. The sale of equipment results from the number of conversations. Everything we do comes from a service perspective. That is how we have maintained a loyal customer base for more than 30 years. Customer support is the central axis of our business. We advise the client in the purchase and use of a device. We try to have simple processes that allow us to make quick decisions and accompany our clients as much as possible.</p><p><strong>How has your partnership with the Ammann Group strengthened your growth expectations, and what value does it add to FIZA?<br></strong>We aim to be the market leaders with Ammann in asphalt plants. Although we have worked together for a short time, we already have more than 90% of the Colombian market. We placed about seven asphalt plants in 2019. Some of these are in the most important concessions in the country and others are with smaller builders but with important projects. Within the relationship between FIZA and Ammann, we add value with market knowledge, strong customer relationships, and unique know-how in terms of infrastructure technology nationwide. Ammann is also the world leader in asphalt plants and is opening 650 plants per year. The closest competitor opens just 200 per year. Ammann has well-mounted infrastructure to market continuous and discontinuous asphalt plants of any size globally. </p><p><strong>How has the distribution of Wacker Neuson diversified your portfolio in infrastructure machinery, compaction plates, water pumps, power plants, and loaders?</strong><br>We have always sold large machinery. Wacker Neuson is the leader in Europe and is assuming a leading position worldwide. We are attracted by the niche market of light and compact equipment. Like other brands, this equipment saves large sums of money and is of an excellent quality. It aligns with the philosophy of FIZA. For us, it is a pleasure to be able to bear the name of the brand. In addition, it is an important player in our internal diversification strategy. </p><p><strong>In 2019, road construction and public and civil projects grew 8.5%. How does this affect the role of FIZA in the development of the sector? </strong><br>Each of the 4G concessions have equipment sold by FIZA. In total, the company has placed more than 1,200 machines. We contribute to these contractors by giving them technology and different applications for the equipment we have commercialized. There is recycling equipment with different technologies, for example, and asphalt plants using 30% recycled materials, not to mention the crushing equipment that works with electric diesel. Customers seek our assistance to help them solve the problems they encounter in their buildings on a day-to-day basis. Unfortunately, the Odebrecht issue has slowed cash flow. Banks are not lending much to the construction sector for fear of problems with corruption. This has slowed down sales slightly, but so far in 2020, we have achieved interesting numbers.</p><p><strong>Colombia has 16 bilateral agreements. How does this contribute to FIZA's future associations for the growth of the local market? <br></strong>We are looking toward the future. All the companies we work with are also thinking about the issue of energy management. Wacker Neuson already manufactures light and compact electrical equipment such as electric charges that have never been seen before. President Duque's goals for 2022 for clean energy also have a great deal to do with foreign trade. Tariffs and taxes can help companies project themselves and create the market for clean energy. </p><p><strong>FIZA has a great role in the development of 4G and tertiary roads. How has the relationship between the government and FIZA evolved, and how does it relate to your impact in the country? </strong><br>President Duque's administration seeks innovative solutions to solve problems such as tertiary roads. We are in constant communication with government entities focused on roads to provide good solutions. These consider the construction methods and maintenance of tertiary roads in the long term, making them sustainable projects over time.<br>What is FIZA's role in renewable energy? <br>Our role is viable. All the asphalt plants we have put in have a recycling system. We take the milled asphalt and introduce it again into what we have in the plant. We can offer plants with up to 100% recycling. This will significantly help us preserve the raw materials or stone aggregates from mountains and rivers. In the end, we will see savings in material consumption and the reuse of materials we have on the road. We also offer a shredder that recycles debris. There are interesting projects in Colombia that reuse up to 80% of materials to generate brick blocks, not to mention the crusher, which is important for granulometry. Regarding energy, all automotive manufacturers are betting on fully electric means, and machinery cannot be left behind. Diesel and diesel engines have a different pollutant grade than other regular or benzine fuel engines, which is why switching to electricity can be better for the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Colombia receives a significant number of tourists and is the gateway to South America in terms of air transportation. What is the status of the El Dorado Airport expansion?<br></strong>The government, through the Ministry of Transport, ANI, and the Civil Aeronautics, is working on an expansion plan for Bogotá's El Dorado International Airport, which has the capacity to mobilize up to 40 million passengers. In 2018, it received 33 million passengers. Currently, ANI has two different unsolicited proposals under structuring that would boost the productivity of the airport. The first aims to complete execution works within 36 months to increase the effectiveness of the existing infrastructure in El Dorado. The second aims to expand the current terminal and construct a low-cost terminal and a third track. These activities will help us increase the space for aircraft parking and the possibility of new positions in the cargo and maintenance of the airport.</p><p><strong>How do you ensure that projects structured by ANI guarantee economic, social, and environmental sustainability?<br></strong>At ANI, we follow and fulfill OECD standards, which imply a series of gradual reforms needed to start the fifth generation of concession projects. These will have some adjustments, especially in terms of sustainability and understanding the concept for its environmental, social, and institutional dimensions. We will make some adjustments based on our experience and the lessons learned from the first, second, third, and fourth generation projects. We will also continue with the transparency that has characterized this entity and develop this through a public policy document (CONPES), which includes the guidelines for the fifth generation of concessions in Colombia.</p><p><strong>How can ANI attract foreign investment to Colombia?<br></strong>ANI is an investment reference at the national and international level for its specialization in infrastructure projects. Its purpose is to plan, structure, contract, manage, and evaluate concession projects and other forms of PPPs, mainly in public transport and related infrastructure. Based on this, since its inception, ANI has developed the 4G program, a portfolio of projects with investments of more than USD60 billion. It is considered the most important infrastructure program in the region. This has caught the attention of large construction companies and financial institutions worldwide. Thus, companies from more than 20 countries have participated in the development of these bidding processes, reflecting the interest in such projects in the country. Foreign investment funds such as CDPQ and the Chicago Pension Fund and  investment funds such as Blackrock, Macquarie, and John Laing have invested in the secondary market in ANI projects. There has been an extensive effort to attract foreign investment in these projects, leading to business opportunities at the local level. </p><p><strong>What are the goals set by ANI for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>The main challenge in 2020 is to continue the reactivation of 4G projects. Now, we have 22 reactivated ones, six that we hope to reactivate during the 1H2020, and one with significant drawbacks. We also intend to move forward with the implementation of OECD corporate governance standards for the agency and issue the policy document CONPES for the fifth generation of concessions that promote environmental and social projects. This will allow us to consolidate the structuring for projects that will soon be awarded. We also have CONPES 3918 of 2018 and the National Development Plan 2018-2022 in which some strategies were prioritized, such as the reactivation and implementation of programs and projects for construction and maintenance of the country's road network, upgrading railroads, strengthening air transport, improve urban mobility, and efficient and safe logistics. These strategies have also been set out in the Pact for Transport and Logistics for Competitiveness and Regional Integration, where we contribute to the objective of sustainable development, industry, innovation, and infrastructure. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Which regions have the greatest housing needs? What policies could improve this situation?<br></strong>By total household numbers, eight states concentrate half of the housing deficit in Colombia: Antioquia, Bolí­var, Bogotá, Córdoba, Valle del Cauca, Cundinamarca, Nariño, and Magdalena. These numbers are highly correlated with large populations and large urbanization processes. However, analyzing the percentage of households with a deficit of total households by department, San Andrés, Chocó, Vichada, Vaupés, Guainí­a, and Amazonas—i.e. the ones with the highest poverty levels—have the highest deficit rates. This is particularly true in rural zones. Nevertheless, Colombia has continuously reduced its housing deficit for more than 20 years via an active housing policy focused on both incentivizing demand through acquisition subsidies and developing new supply. Today, demand-side subsidies are the focus of our housing policy, giving citizens the possibility of choosing where they want to live. Currently, we have developed four main programs to tackle these challenges. First is Mi Casa Ya, a program of housing subsidies designed for households with monthly incomes below USD1,070. The subsidy includes a voucher for the downpayment and a subsidy for the mortgage's interest rate for a seven-year period. Second is Semillero de Propietarios, a program that targets those who cannot get a mortgage largely because they are part of the informal economy and unbanked. This program was designed with two objectives in mind: providing a solution that allows them to access decent housing and encouraging financial inclusion and helping beneficiaries establish a good credit history that makes them eligible for a mortgage in the future. Through this “social renting program," the government subsidizes close to USD150 of rent payments per month, while households contribute the remainder, a minimum of USD 100, in addition to an agreed upon monthly savings amount. By the end of the two-year subsidy period, the objective is for these beneficiaries to apply to Mi Casa Ya and buy a house of their own. Third is Casa Digna Vida Digna, a housing and neighborhood improvement strategy that contributes to reducing the qualitative deficit in Colombia. This program includes titling, whereby households that can prove a 10-year occupancy in lands that were built informally on state-owned land are given titles to the property. The other two components of the program are home improvement and public infrastructure for neighborhood amelioration such as parks, schools, and nurseries, among others. Finally, we are leading a national strategy to unlock more urban land for housing developments. This includes working closely with municipalities by helping them to update their urban planning framework according to the actual needs of their population and development plans, thereby properly zoning the territory and land usage in their jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>What policies have been created to improve the conditions of homes built with precarious materials and in risk areas?<br></strong>Casa Digna Vida Digna is our home and neighborhood improvement program, which tackles the housing qualitative deficit via three dimensions: titling for qualifying houses in informal settlements; housing interventions to improve structural and even aesthetic deficiencies; and overall neighborhood improvement. In Colombia, the qualitative deficit is twice the quantitative one. For this reason, this program is at the center of our strategy, and we have an ambitious target of 600,000 beneficiaries with improvement interventions by 2022. These interventions target critical housing elements defined in the Multidimensional Poverty Index, which means that by accomplishing the program's goal, nearly 1 million people will potentially be lifted out of multidimensional poverty. Furthermore, the policy promotes the guidelines set by the New Urban Agenda, introducing a new concept of housing quality: inclusiveness, resilient and sustainable housing, and quality surroundings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the car rental business taken shape in Bogotá, and how does this compare with the rest of the country and areas where you have a presence?</strong><br>We have almost six years of operational experience and have grown over 20% per year. We currently operate in Bogotá, Rionegro, and Cartagena and are poised to open an office in Cali. In these six years, despite certain barriers that our service faces in Bogotá, it has represented 45% of our national operation. However, this is likely to fall in the future, since we have increased our business in Medellí­n and Cartagena as well. In the past, each of these cities accounted for 25% of our total business, but today the figure is between 31% and 28%, respectively.</p><p><strong>Let's talk about the strategies that have underpinned your 20% annual growth. What strategies are you carrying out with regards to innovation and digitalization? </strong><br>We are connected to the main GDS' in the tourism industry, which gives us agility to modify availability and price in real time. If we open an office today, in two minutes we are already available to the millions of users and travel agencies that use Sabre, Amadeus, or Galileo, given our presence on these portals. So far, our focus has been on tourism, though we want to grow and see great potential in the short and long-term corporate segment in Colombia. The short-term car rental industry has grown in tourism, corporate, and the replacement vehicle segment. </p><p><strong>What is the appeal of the corporate market? <br></strong>A company that has vehicles for the use of its officials has large assets that depreciate and require capital expenditure to meet them. We offer a rental option to use a vehicle when required without needing a large initial investment. That is money that can be directed elsewhere within a company. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Renting Automayor ranks among the largest companies in Colombia in terms of the services it offers. How has demand for these services changed?</strong><br>Renting Automayor is not one of the largest companies, though it has seen an important growth in market share. The operating lease industry in the country has evolved significantly, especially in the last four to five years, due to several factors such as the termination of government benefits to SMEs in the accounting of finance lease operations. It formerly allowed for the accounting of such operations as operating leases. This allowed even great global players to enter the market, which lent it more dynamism.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of the fleet management services you offer, and who are the potential customers of this service?<br></strong>Potential customers are companies that already have several vehicles as fixed assets to serve their core business. They are not transporters, but industrial businesses requiring vehicles to distribute their products or services. We provide such customers technical efficiencies like maintenance, leading to better profitability and efficiency levels.</p><p><strong>How do you stay competitive amidst the entry of international players that offer similar services?<br></strong>This will always be a challenge. We are not necessarily a niche company, but serve several market segments, where for each of those segments we have to define products and services that match those customer profiles.</p><p><span class="redactor-selection-marker"><span class="redactor-selection-marker"></span></span>Have you identified any services that you currently do not offer that you plan to offer in the future?<br><span class="redactor-selection-marker"></span><span class="redactor-selection-marker"></span>Definitely. Identifying new services is a permanent effort within the company, and we have a dedicated committee and pursuing the matter of improving a current service or creating a new product or service.</p><p><br><br><br>You talked about the importance of strategic alliances to meet demand. How many alliances does Renting Automayor have?<br></p><p>The operating lease (renting) business increasingly requires closer strategic allies. We prefer not to call our suppliers as such but rather strategic allies since we try to combine services that we do not necessarily offer through third parties. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>In 2018, Renting Colombia consolidated a fleet of 19,000 vehicles. What led to the consolidation of this growth, and how will you continue to grow?<br></strong>There was 12% growth in the long-term business of the company, and for Localiza, in terms of fleet size, we will grow around 45%. The long-term business, which is focused on corporate clients, has been in place for 23 years and is still growing at 12%, which, given the current economic situation of the country, is a great number. In that line of business, we have been growing in corporate fleets that are specialized and have associated services, guaranteeing availability during contracts that usually lasts for six to seven years with full maintenance, insurance, and taxes. Localiza has doubled the number of agencies that service clients, from 21 to 40, in 18 cities around the country. This allows us to provide services to 92% of the GDP produced in Colombia. We are also growing as a fleet to supply these new agencies and the growing demand and market. We are changing the culture, because short-term car rentals are not in high demand compared to other countries in the region, and even smaller compared to Europe and the US. The rent-a-car business in Colombia is informal, and we are transforming it by using new vehicles, having international standards in terms of services and fees, and ensuring there are no surprises. People feel they never know the real cost of a car rental, but they do with us because we are clear on fees. In 2019, we started a new project for long-term rentals to individuals, as we are trying to change the culture from owning a car to merely paying for its usage. These are three-year contracts that include everything, including maintenance. We make the process simple for both joining and exiting the program.</p><p><strong>Renting Colombia and Auteco signed an agreement on electric mobility. How important are renewable energies for the future, and what will be their long-term role?</strong><br>It is not a fad for us; it is a strategic decision as a company and a country. We are determined to change mobility in Colombia. While many think switching from fuel to electric-powered cars amounts to the biggest change, the reality is that the greatest contaminants are delivery fleets, which are diesel powered and about 20 years old. And there are no renewable alternatives in that market. Five years ago, we decided to partner with companies like Auteco and others around the world to create a project called “a thousand solutions." With this project, we will bring 1,000 trucks for urban distribution. We initially set the goal for 2021, but already have 400 vehicles working in the field with excellent results. We even have five-year contracts with some clients. We want zero pollution in terms of emissions, noise, and particulates. We are heavily betting on resources, knowledge, and technology to transform the distribution sector. Bancolombia is the most sustainable financial group in the world, and this partnership completely fits our strategy. We are also investing in cars to rent out electric vehicles. We want users to give electric cars a try and understand that they are safe, comfortable, and efficient. Thus far, we have had positive results. We also have a plan to create and promote green corridors from Localiza for tourism that include mountains, rivers, and scenery.</p><p><strong>What other strategic partnerships do you have or are you considering? <br></strong>A key aspect of our rental business is partnerships. To service our fleet, which has almost 23,000 vehicles, we have over 1,200 partnerships with maintenance providers, manufacturers, insurers, financial institutions, governments, and local municipalities. We need to support clients during the length of their contract to ensure continuity. We also need to have partnerships with energy providers for the electric fleet and to ensure that charging stations are cost effective and well located. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What added value does OPL offer to differentiate itself in the competitive logistics industry?<br></strong>Our key added value is innovation and adaptability. We are constantly searching for alternatives that enable us to become strategic and reliable business partners for our customers. With that goal in mind, we have developed an integrated logistical service platform by offering several types of services that complement each other. We offer not only road transport—our starting point from which we learned to diversify—but also specialize in different types of cargo such as liquid, reefer, and containers, allowing our company to diversify and work with multiple industries. Colombia is a commodity-based country, meaning that depending on only one type of service is a fairly high risk. Today, we have over 26 offices and transport over 5 million tons per year.</p><p><strong>Which sector of the economy presents the greatest opportunities for expansion and growth in the medium and long term?<br></strong>Containers and reefer cargo are both high-growth cargo channels in the Colombian economy. For containers, OPL applies high security schemes regarding vendor and customers selection as well. We offer customs transmittal fee (DTA) and multimodal transport operation (OTM), allowing us to provide a door-to-door delivery that minimizes regulatory hurdles, and, therefore, transit times at customs facilities. As for the reefer sector, we are reacting to the growth in demand of fruits, vegetables, meats, and other food products that require temperature-controlled environments.</p><p><strong>You are a pioneer in Colombia in the integration of river, land, and rail transport. What was the process of integrating these types of transport like?</strong><br>Our company has always believed in multi-modal transport to be an effective solution that brings benefits to logistic companies and customers. In this path, government support is extremely important for being able to make it work. Since we founded the company in 2006, it has always been clear to us that we should not only have trucks for transportation but that to move cargo from one place to the other, we should integrate every means of transport and offer a multi-channel portfolio of cargo. For that, we started operating in ports along the Magdalena River that could be navigable all-year round, while finding business partners who could complement us with the logistics and technology challenges of river transportation. We also partnered up with Holdtrade Atlantico, a railroad logistics company, to develop the railroad business, though this will require additional regulatory assistance to grow to its full potential.</p><p><strong>OPL offers complementary services for its customers, such as storage in warehouses and container deconsolidation. How important is adaptability in a business like this?</strong><br>Adaptability sets one apart from other companies in the market, by which we can establish a long-term relationship with customers. For us, it was a key factor knowing from the beginning that these services would make a difference in the Colombian logistical business. For major cities that are 600-1,000km from the Caribbean and Pacific ports, paying inland freight for a 20ft or 40ft container is extremely expensive due to fixed container costs, as well as the variable costs of time and distance between origin and destination. Today, we have as much as 700 monthly cargo transfer operations that help our customers lower their costs and speed up their transit times.</p><p><strong>In its alliance with Surtigas, OPL operates trucks that use natural gas. What is your commitment to the environment, and how will this benefit the company in the long run?</strong><br>Our commitment to the environment is to reduce greenhouse emissions by using such trucks. This initiative will benefit our company by allowing us to move forward on the path to sustainability and bring new and additional business opportunities, as we are the first to offer this type of service. There is no small contribution regarding climate change.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges presented by the operations and logistics market today?<br></strong>The main challenges are technology, namely providing information from the inside to our clients and vendors, ensuring security in all of our transactions, and investing in more efficient, profitable, and eco-friendly trucks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were some main areas of focus and milestones in 2019?<br></strong>2019 was an important year in terms of the development of the telecoms sector in Colombia. We had a major overhaul in terms of regulation and framework. The new regulation features several elements that are crucial for the future of Colombia's telecommunications sector. The first is spectrum allocation, which creates a much more certain environment and allows greater investment. Under the Law of Modernization of the ICT sector (Law 1978 of 2019) our policy has changed from maximizing financial income to maximizing social wellbeing. In 2019, not only were we able to modify the legal framework but we also established a convergent regulator. This was one element the OECD was particularly insistent on. Notably, we set up the entire spectrum allocation process within a few months and created free internet zones across the country. Currently, there are 1,000 such zones in rural areas and 870 in urban ones. The government's policy for the sector can be divided between connectivity and digital transformation. We are undertaking the most ambitious social connectivity program the country has ever seen.</p><p><strong>How is Colombia implementing its 5G plan?<br></strong>Colombia is one of the few countries in the region with a 5G plan. We took a lot of input from different sources and integrated them into our 5G plan. We have already opened an expression-of-interest process for companies, telecoms operators, and anyone else with projects that can bring 5G to Colombia. Once we have those,  we will evaluate them and promote them in medium-sized cities. 5G is probably more suited for large cities,  but we still encourage thinking out of the box. </p><p><strong>What is the government's ambition for Colombia's digital transformation?<br></strong>We have the WEF-certified Center For the Fourth Industrial Revolution  in Medellí­n. We are creating a digital ecosystem that connects infrastructure and services to enable sharing and analyzing of information needed for IoT. Our goal is to not just be a participant but a leader in Latin America. </p><p><strong>How is the ministry ensuring Colombia has the talent to bring IoT to real life?<br></strong>We are working with the Ministry of Education on several  initiatives. One is Coding for Kids, a program that is currently serving 23,000 students in public schools. 30% of these students are from rural areas. In 2020, we aim to cover more than 60,000 students. We need to  ensure we have the relevant programs in universities and educational institutions to prepare the youth for the future. Employability is at the root of what we do. In 2020, we will also launch a pilot data science course called Data Science for All. We introduced a similar program online for AI in 2019 and received 50,000 applications for 12,000 slots. This shows Colombians  want to learn skills related to the Fourth Industrial Revolution. We are doing this via SENA, our technical education organization. We will continue to find new ways to create the optimal digital ecosystem for a digital society. </p><p><strong>How are you implementing digital transformation in the public sector? <br></strong>Things should start at home, which is exactly what we are doing. President Iván Duque is fully aware of the importance of the fourth industrial revolution, which is why he hired a presidential advisor for digital transformation. Instead of taking small steps forward, we are working with other governments that have successfully applied digital transformation strategies. We adopted the X Road platform from Estonia and the digital government model from Mexico. The digital transformation of the government is based on the fact that what we do has to have an impact on the citizen. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Ford organized in Latin America?<br></strong>The company has divided South America into three areas. One bloc is Brazil, another Argentina, and the third is the West Coast and Direct Markets. This latter group, which consists of Chile, Colombia, and Peru, is similar in that each has a more open economy. Ecuador, Bolivia, Uruguay, and Paraguay are also part of this group, and we call them direct markets, where dealers and distributors place direct orders for our products from different sources. Finally, there is Venezuela, where we have an assembly facility in idle awaiting economic conditions to improve.  Chile, Colombia, and Peru have their own commercial force and stocks to serve the markets; the vehicle sales and service divisions operate under the same structure.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits for Ford of operating under a West Coast market?<br></strong>The strategy behind the creation of this market was to unite countries with similar characteristics. This means we would have a similar product that can be equally distributed in each of these markets. If I have an Explorer in Colombia, we would sell the same product in Chile, for instance. There is a great opportunity to make synergies since this group of countries closed with 1.1 million vehicles in 2019. Chile sold 386,000, Colombia 264,000, Peru 170,000, and Ecuador 133,000. Bolivia, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Venezuela collectively sold 130,000 vehicles. In all, Ford sells 4% of that big market, with an emphasis on SUVs and pickups.  We are in a volatile market and working in this region makes us more agile. For instance, in 2019 we had a large amount of stock in Chile and were able to send committed production volume to other markets during the social unrest in 4Q2019 to reduce the carrying costs of inventory. There are many things that we put together to make the operation more effective.</p><p><strong>What benefits can the client see from this consolidation?<br></strong>Clients can benefit from the volume scale and similar product specifications within the markets of the group that allows access to products that did not exist before because the market was not big enough to import some of our vehicles. One of the characteristics of Ford is that all our vehicles are equipped with the latest safety equipment, a great deal of innovation and technology. When we look at the marketing indicators, Ford is seen as one of the most innovative companies in the sector as well as one of the most environmentally friendly. </p><p><strong>Do you plan to launch a hybrid vehicle?<br></strong>In 2019, we launched our first hybrid, the Fusion, and in May 2020 we will launch the Escape, our second hybrid vehicle. The car industry is going through a radical change that people did not foresee five years ago. Now, there are several countries in Europe, including the UK, that have said that by 2035, cars that use only fossil fuel will not be allowed in circulation. This is a reality that will also influence these markets in South America. Ford has shown its commitment to maintain its leadership in new technologies; the latest announcements on electric versions of the Mustang Mach E and F-150, the two most iconic vehicles from the brand, is full proof of that.  In the meantime, Ford is offering vehicles equipped with lower displacement EcoBoost fuel engines capable of performing better with less fuel consumption and emissions.</p><p><strong>How are you adapting your portfolio to clients' preferences?<br></strong>We are focused on delivering well-equipped products with great quality and the latest technologies to delight the customer. Our product portfolio will strengthen with well recognized entries in the most aspirational segments of the market, including SUVs and pickups. We will continue to strengthen our brand with value-added features and synergies from products coming from different sources benefiting from free trade agreements to boast our leadership in innovation. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How can Colombia invest in air transport infrastructure to meet its full potential?<br></strong>In the last 12 years, Colombia has posted impressive growth, increasing from 12 million passengers per year in the country to 38 million in December 2018. That is mainly because Colombia has many large cities within a diversified geography. The Civil Aviation Authority has been developing an infrastructure plan and will invest around COP1 billion in different regional airports as part of its 2030 plan. This includes not only investment in infrastructure but the possibility of having new concessions in some of the regional airports and developing new PPPs to expand several capital airports and develop new aerial bilateral agreements. We already have 64 bilateral aerial agreements but are on the verge of having 17 new agreements with 15 countries by the end of 2020. The growth of the aviation sector was due to the economic growth of Colombia, which resulted in a stable middle class, in turn leading to the rise of low-cost airlines. Colombia is growing at a rate of 3.5%, which compares favorably to many of our partner countries and the developed word. Moving forward, we have a huge infrastructure challenge because of the development and investment done by the Civil Aviation Authority. Some of these airports are located in remote regions where the only airline that operates is the state airline, Satena.</p><p><strong>How is the government planning to restart and complete the 4G projects?<br></strong>The government has already delivered. When the new government came into power, of 30 projects, six were proceeding as planned, three had some issues, and 21 were halted. Notwithstanding the contracts signed between 2014 and 2016, only minimal work had been done on most of them. This was for many reasons: administrative, environmental, and a lack of government coordination. Designing, structuring, and financing a project is one thing but constructing it is something else. The National Infrastructure Agency (ANI) was a new entity that was strong on the financial side but weak on the territorial and execution side. This is why we had an economic activation room in August 2018, where we sat down with all the actors and the attorney general's office to determine the problems and propose alternative solutions. Once this public document was released, we started executing decisions and solutions. We set the target to enforce 70% of the projects by March 2019 and achieved this with 21 projects underway by the end of March. Civil construction fell in the first three quarters of 2018, respectively, and by 4Q2018 we increased it by 5.5%. In 1Q2019, the sector grew by 6.5%, which is more than the economy as a whole. During this period, we had two new financial closes; by December 2019, we delivered at least five more financially closed projects. Notably, some projects are happening even without the financial closure since people are putting money in with a bridge loan or equity. We took decisions, negotiated transaction agreements, signed modifications to contracts, and developed a strategy with the Colombian environmental agency to give alternatives to several projects, such as La Ruta del Cacao, which did not have financial closure due to uncertainties about an environmental license. The original proposal was rejected, but we gave time and space with an alternative location for the road. This gave bankers greater confidence in order to close the financial deal. This is how we have been working on different projects, such as the Cambao-Manizales route, where we are on the verge of signing a new agreement thanks to an alternative found for the environmental license. There were challenges in terms of a reduction in income due to less traffic, which is why we came up with a new agreement in recognition of the reduction of traffic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have you managed to consolidate the company in Colombia?<br></strong>Corredor Empresarial was formed by all the permanent betting entrepreneurs in Colombia. The company is responsible for participating in tenders and gaming and betting licenses nationwide. For example, SUPER Astro has been in the market for more than 10 years and is the most representative game in the country. We are fortunate to be leaders in the market with SUPER Astro. Additionally, in 2017, we obtained the license to operate Betplay, an online sports betting brand that recently completed two years of operations. Moreover, we have two networks: suRed and SuperGIROS. Using the two networks, we can have more than 35,000 physical points throughout the country.</p><p><strong>You have the AWLA certification for responsible gaming with a level-one framework. How easy has it been to introduce this betting model in Colombia? </strong><br>We comply with the guidelines of the Coljuegos. When players enter our page, they can set limits on how much they want to play; players can even deposit monthly or daily. If the player wants to change these limits, it requires our approval. We are linked to 25 companies nationwide, each of which has a compliance officer that monitors compliance with all regulations and assets. This allows us to protect ourselves and shows banks that we are a regulated entity. Betplay represents our largest portfolio in sports betting. In 2019, we also introduced casino bets and table games on our platform, such as blackjack, roulette, or baccarat. We plan to integrate many more modalities to keep growing and create a culture that already exists in other countries. An example is Fantasy, a famous game in the US that generates millions of dollars in revenue. Having different games is not always highly profitable for us but we are interested in diversifying so that the client has more options. For us, this means clients get used to our platform and style of play. </p><p><strong>Can you summarize the success of Betplay?<br></strong>We have the best partners worldwide. This has allowed us to offer highly competitive products. Our nationwide network is robust, and we have the trust of our shareholders. We have made strong investments in advertising. In 2019, we expect to invest around USD8 million in advertising. An example of this is what we did with the Colombian Football Federation. We welcome the national team and we are one of its official collaborators. </p><p><strong>How do you interpret the transformation of Chance? <br></strong>All these businesses originated from the Chance, whose target was adults. It lacked an attractive product for young people. We realized that overall, 60-70% of the sector's sales came from people aged between 18 and 35 years. We saw the gap and decided to target the youth. We must relate more to the end customer and create the digital environment necessary to build relationships with all the networks we are working with in Colombia.</p><p><strong>One of your goals is to cover 50% of the online gaming market. What progress have you made so far?<br></strong>In terms of net income, we represent 50% of the online betting market in Colombia. This varies monthly between 46 and 50%. In terms of gross sales, we have around 45% of the market. Our aim is to control 60%, and we expect to reach 50% in the near future.</p><p><strong>How are you working to guarantee a responsible game with a specific social impact? <br></strong>I have been in the industry for 15 years and have learned that the market needs players who aim to have fun and not players who bet until they lose everything. We make one of the biggest contributions to the health sector; we  expect to contribute more than COP124 billion in 2019. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the history of Universidad Santo Tomás?<br></strong>Universidad Santo Tomás was the first university in Colombia, founded in 1580. We are over 440 years old, while the second oldest is around 360. We are in a historic reality that includes present and future realities. The order that manages the university is the Dominicans friars. The university has nearly 30,000 students and employs more than 4,000 people between academics and administrative staff. We could say that it is a big company that supports the country's growth.</p><p><strong>What has been your contribution to Colombia?<br></strong>There have been a few important moments in our history. We were the first university in Colombia that took a step to ensure there was an educational institution during the colonial era. For example, the first “Muisca" grammar was written by Dominicans. That connection between the indigenous worlds and Spain took place through knowledge. Academia was important to protect the human rights of the indigenous. Then, during the independence period, we Dominicans were heavily involved; the priest of Bolí­var, as a matter of fact, was a Dominican. The third moment was when the industrial revolution took place, because the university in the 20th century emerged as one of the most important educational institutions in the country. Some presidents, ministers, and many judges graduated from Universidad Santo Tomás. This university has been part of the country's main historic moments, though we are going through the digitalization processes that the world is experiencing.</p><p><strong>How does the Christian philosophy play a part in the educational spirit of the university?<br></strong>The Christian humanism is a paramount factor to education. We support humanism, particularly Christian, which has an essential trace. For us, the philosophical learning is important. We have organized for more than 40 years an international congress every two years about Latin American philosophy. The Christian humanism and the thought of Saint Thomas Aquinas are a universal thought. Saint Thomas particularly focused the structure and thinking method. The main role of universities is to boost knowledge, and we structure knowledge through Thomas Aquinas' way of thinking.</p><p><strong>How is Universidad Santo Tomás focused on developing all the different regions of Colombia?<br></strong>We are a Multi-Campus University. We are highly committed to the development of the regions in Colombia. The university has campuses in Tunja, Villavicencio, Medellí­n, Bogotá, and Bucaramanga. We have presence in other 18 cities, through Universitary Attention Centres, which support the long, open, and distance learning process to provide education to people who live in more remote areas. That has helped us get closer to these people and has been a fundamental component for us. We also focus on e-learning and new developments. Thus, we continue to invest in technology and have excellent laboratories. For example, we have a new lab about water in Villavicencio, where people from all over that region go to conduct research. Another important factor for us is social responsibility. In Bucaramanga, for instance, we have dentist chairs that attend low-income people in the region. This is a Catholic university, which means our interest is not in generating profits, but serving the people. We have approved a new master's degree in language learning and is conducted via e-learning. E-learning allows us to provide services abroad.</p><p><strong>What is your view on the educational sector in Colombia, and what new courses are you planning to launch?<br></strong>We are working strongly to better spread information in every process. Digitalization is taking us in that direction, so we look at programs related to public policy, for example. We are working on business, statistics, and engineering in order to adapt our programs to those environments where information is paramount for decision making. We are focused on environment and society matters. All our research revolves around those topics.</p><p><strong>What are your next goals for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>I am not interested in being the “best university" in Colombia, but in being a reference for what it means to be a relevant university in this country. If someone wants to focus on what teaching means, this is the university. That is more important to us than being the first in rankings. We want to be a reference in terms of society, teaching, and providing human values to our students and the country as a whole. And we can only achieve that through quality. Quality is the only road we can go through if we want to achieve things for society. We were the first private university certified as Multi-Campus, and we have international certifications being part of a network of Latin American universities. We should look closer to North America, with the US and Canada, because there are many developments taking place there. However, there is a language barrier, though we are working on that to improve our networking with those universities. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The Carnival of Barranquilla was recognized by UNESCO 17 years ago. What has been the role of the company in putting this event and the city on the global map?<br></strong>The carnival is part of the soul of our local community. About 20 years ago, we realized just how special and unique our carnival was and started working on a dossier for UNESCO. The cultural and material heritage was just appearing because the architectural heritage has always existed. In November 2003, the festival was proclaimed an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Once Barranquilla received that title, the carnival put the city on the global map. The city's exponential growth has also helped promote Barranquilla to the world, and we have been an important element of this brand because ours is the second-largest carnival in the world. For us, the most important thing is the growth of the city. We contribute via the development of parks and public spaces as well as the promotion of local employment and the orange economy. The city and carnival have grown hand in hand, and we welcome our role as ambassadors of Colombia.</p><p><strong>What other activities does the carnival promote throughout the year? <br></strong>We are a public-private organization—48% public and the rest private—that also provides consulting services to other local and international events organized by the public and private sectors. Recently, we helped organize the Cartagena Independence Parades as well as the Buenos Aires Carnival. We have 20 full-time employees, and, five months prior to the carnival, we hire more than 7,000 new direct employees and create up to 40,000 indirect jobs. In the next few months, we will inaugurate the interactive carnival museum, which has attracted a great deal of interest from the people of Barranquilla as well as the tourism sector.<br> <br><strong>What is the role of Fundación Carnaval?<br></strong>We have the foundation and the Carnival SAS. The donations go through the foundation, and the museum is managed by the foundation. The foundation works on social and sustainability programs and manages our editorial line that works on books, magazines, and brochures. The SAS, on the other hand, manages everything for the carnival, from programming to operations.<br> <br><strong>The carnival queen will participate in the New York Latin Fashion Week. How important is participation in these international events?</strong> <br>The diffusion of the Barranquilla carnival is extremely important, and these events multiply our audience exponentially. That leads to more tourism, sustainability, and consumption. Everything is linked. Sending the carnival queen to the New York Latin Fashion Week represents a great moment for us and all the Latin American communities in the US.<br> <br><strong>What is the importance of the carnival's alliances with private companies? <br></strong>The carnival generates COP29 billion in revenue annually. Of that, 40% comes from private sponsorships, 50% comes from the box office and events, and the final 10% comes from the district mayor's office and the Ministry of Culture, among others. That is the importance of the private sector. As such, we have to adhere to advertising regulations and UNESCO sponsorship guidelines. The importance of the carnival to the city is so tangible that many companies feel a commitment and social responsibility to support it.<br>  <br><strong>How has Barranquilla become the cultural center of the Caribbean region of Colombia, and what will make the 2020 carnival more impressive than that of 2019? </strong><br>Barranquilla is undoubtedly the cultural capital of the Caribbean region. The carnival will continue to grow but it has to maintain the tradition and remain sustainable. The world is finally realizing that events like these lead to social development, tourism, and employment. Indeed, our goal is for each year to be better than the last. We try to continuously innovate and think out of the box. The 2020 carnival will be better because it will start in the peak season around December, showcasing our cultural variety to UNESCO delegates. Equally important, the museum will be open by then. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What is your commitment to innovation and technology?<br></strong>We maintain a leading position. We employ innovative laser technology, while all of our operations are digital, using 3D printers and digital planning. A surgery is done three times: virtually, digitally, and in real time. This gives the patient safety and is truly innovative. Technology also allows us to observe surgeries in other countries. We also share surgeries we perform here with colleagues in the education sector.</p><p><strong>Which country sends the largest number of dental tourists?<br></strong>Many people come from Europe, notably Spain, Germany, and Italy, essentially for treatment in the private sector. Medical tourism is strong in Antioquia, especially in Medellí­n, with cardiovascular surgery, implants, and grafts leading the charts. If we had the support of international advertising and agreements, the dentistry sector could triple within two years.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>A common goal is union. We want to achieve an understanding with various actors such as universities, companies, and the state. If we establish this triad, we will strengthen the dental sector. A premise of the business circle is that every dentist should have business principles and the requisite skills to operate with commercial efficiency.</p><p><strong>How have you implemented technology and innovation?<br></strong>I am president of the International Academy of Ceramic Implantology. In the future, we will see the elimination of all metal from the mouth, including titanium in implants. This academy covers Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru, and Central America, but we are already connected all over the world. We held the first International Congress of Ceramic Implantology in Latin America. We brought in doctors from Italy, the US, Germany, and Venezuela.</p><p><strong>Is there any strategy for catering to the celebrity market?<br></strong>We have stayed in this niche and enjoyed coverage on television. We are linked with modeling agencies and the G4 group. We also hold image and smile design workshops for models. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the profile of companies that BCA serves, and how you are helping them currently?<br></strong>Over the past years, we have had the opportunity to support clients in different industries across Latin America. However, we are now extremely keen to serve companies in industries with high social and environmental impact, including the emerging cannabis sector. We specialize in helping clients to reach their corporate finance, capital raising, and M&amp;A goals. As a response to the current headwinds, we recently launched a restructuring practice to support harmed companies.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you see in Colombia for FDI during the recovery period?<br></strong>Colombia is the fourth-largest economy in Latin America and it is expected to be among the countries in the region that recovers more rapidly after COVID-19. Likewise, the country enjoys economic and political stability, with stable growth above 3% over the past 10 years that has gradually attracted unprecedented levels of FDI. A large portion of the economy is driven by agribusiness, given the access to abundant natural resources and labor coupled with excellent climate conditions and 12 hours of natural light all-year round, to mention just a few. In addition, Colombia has 100-plus FTZs that represents a trade advantage with the 60-plus countries to whom it has FTAs in force, especially those with countries where medical cannabis has been regulated. Across the agribusiness environment, Colombia offers a broad portfolio of investment opportunities going from the traditional and well-known products such as coffee, banana, flowers, cocoa, and avocado (haas) to the newly cannabis-derived products. In this regard, Asocolcanna has said that as soon as the area that is being cultivated by different players reaches 100,000sqft, exports of medical cannabis extracts and resins will be in the range of USD180 million. For its part, Fedesarrollo, an economic think tank, has projected revenues from exports of medical cannabis of approximately USD800 million by 2025, with a more optimistic scenario in the long run reaching USD2.3 billion. Colombia is then poised to supply more than 40% of the global production of cannabis with an expected market in Latin America exceeding USD13 billion in annual sales by 2028. It is evident that the country is well stationed to take part in this rising industry that might help speed up the recovery of our economy.</p><p><strong>How do you see Colombia maintaining its regional leadership position in the medical cannabis industry?</strong><br>Unlike Uruguay, neighboring countries are still working on their regulations with some delays expected for this year. Colombia legalized medical cannabis in 2017 and ever since has strived to pave the way with the help of the largest regional players headquartered in the country. As of 2019, more than USD500 million had been deployed in the local cannabis industry, and the industry is expected to finally take off in 2020 and all those companies start to monetize their investments. In Colombia, the production of a gram of cannabis flower costs us between USD0.5 and USD0.8. In addition, companies locally invest around USD300,000 per hectare cultivated and up to USD1.5 million per hectare in laboratory buildout, which could be around 80% lower than construction costs in North America and Europe.</p><p><strong>How have you seen the medical cannabis sector specifically get impacted by this pandemic and how do you see its recovery afterwards?</strong><br>From our view, the industry reacted contrary to what it was expected. To start, exports of non-psychoactive and psychoactive cannabis are expected to continue in 2020, and this has not changed as a consequence of COVID-19. This is the key element for the industry to formally take off. Additionally, several developments in the industry not only in Colombia but regionally have set the course. Khiron became the first company authorized to sell medical cannabis in the country through the patient prescriptions. It was also authorized to manufacture high- and low-THC medical cannabis and to fill prescriptions for low-THC medical cannabis. Clever Leaves secured funds for USD14 million early in April from institutional investors and most recently, announced they entered into a business combination agreement with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) intended to trade on NASDAQ once all the required approvals are granted. Other companies in the region also managed to secure funds (Avicanna with USD1.8 million, Canna Eden in Uruguay for USD1.7 million, YVY Life Sciences in Uruguay for USD1.7 million, among other transactions that are not publicly known). All these combined with 250-plus transactions closed in the US and Canada over 1H2020 clearly show a sign that the industry has been attracting investors' attention. We have spent a significant amount of time having conversations with strategic potential investors from different countries interested in taking part in Colombia's attractiveness, and the government must notice this and ease exports in the very short term. We know there is a considerable amount of dry powder of approximately USD3 billion to be deployed in cannabis, from which a third of it could be invested in the region as soon as the players have a clearer path to become revenue generators companies. Main players still must prove their business models work as described in their investment decks and that they have the skills set to deliver as promised.</p><p><strong>What are your targets and goals for the rest of 2020 and 2021?<br></strong>We are seeing industries fully focused in the recovery period to quickly adapt themselves to this new normal. Unfortunately, there are companies filing for bankruptcy, distressed enterprises looking at restructuring, and others with capital constraints. We are definitely committed to supporting them in overcoming those challenges with innovative financial and strategic solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>New companies are entering the medical cannabis business all the time. How does FCM differ from other companies?<br></strong>We are highly focused on providing high-quality extracts for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and nutritional companies, while maintaining an excellent relationship with our customers and off-takers by having a solid understanding of their needs in terms of what product to deliver and launch in the desired market. We have the central ingredients—CBD, THC, CBN, and CBG—for any final products for consumers.<br><br><strong>How does FGM Global seek to differentiate itself to improve its position in the market?<br></strong>In the supply of cannabis extracts, we define quality as the consistency of the supply of a product with specifications expected by the client, free of heavy metals, pesticides, or any component other than expected, satisfying the client's expectations. All these parameters should be based as much as possible on complying with the methodologies given in European or Canadian pharmacopoeias, among others. Hence, one of the promises of this industry is that cannabis extracts are as natural as possible. It is important to know that quality management is the set of planned and systematic actions to provide confidence considering all those aspects have an impact on the product's quality and service. Hence, we focus on implementing a quality culture with all members of the company and close friends, achieving a generalized commitment to quality practices, and process improvement at all hierarchical levels.</p><p><strong>What have been your efforts to achieve that quality and consistency in your products?<br></strong>This quality is achieved through a rigorous and standardized quality process at every step from seed, propagation and cultivation, cutting, drying, extraction, refinement, and packaging. These standardized processes are internationally recognized under ISO standards, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).</p><p><strong>What efforts have you made to achieve this quality and consistency, and what are your processes to strengthen the agricultural part?</strong><br>When it comes to plant growth, there is an entire standardized process to ensure they are healthy. Within the cultivation process, it is important to highlight the GLOBAL GAP, which allows us to trace and control the production chain at all times. We establish control parameters such as good collection practices, the correct use of personal protection elements, and information records of the plants 24/7 in order to guarantee safety and avoid cross contamination throughout the whole process. On top of this, we make sure to implement processes of evaluation and verification of the behavior of our varieties; this is how it all starts, from the rigorous selection of those varieties with characteristics of commercial and agricultural importance, adaptability to the tropics, and yield. Prior to the establishment of the crop, it is necessary to verify all those elements that are in contact with the plant and that can intervene with its development, such as high levels of heavy metals and pesticides, harmful microorganisms, or foreign elements. Subsequently, during the establishment and growth of the crop, the environmental, microbiological, and nutritional conditions to which the plants are exposed are monitored with the aim of detecting changes that may affect the cannabinoid content of the plants or their health.</p><p><strong>How does FCM Global achieve quality of the final product?<br></strong>One of the main items within the quality management system is to establish a program for cleaning and disinfecting areas, equipment, and utensils, since the quality of the product depends on the hygiene present in any implement, personnel, or related area in the flow process. Cleaning is the absence of dirt, and its purpose is to reduce or kill microorganisms that can contaminate products and cause deterioration. Disinfecting, meanwhile, can be defined as partly eliminating the number of bacteria found in an environment or surface, so that it is not harmful to people and products. The main objective is to establish guidelines that avoid cross-contamination and ensure the safety of the product, environment, facilities, and personnel. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Clever Leaves merged with Northern Swan. What does this merger mean for the two companies?<br></strong>The merger is about growing the Clever Leaves brand in Colombia and transforming it into a global brand. Before the merger, Clever Leaves was the largest licensed cannabis producer in Colombia with over 600 employees. Clever Leaves broke down barriers internationally by exporting Colombian-made cannabinoid products to Canada and Europe. At the same time, Northern Swan, the majority owner of Clever Leaves, was active in a number of other cannabis-related segments, including production and distribution in Portugal and Germany, nutraceutical manufacturing in the US, a technology company in Canada, and some initial operations in the UK.</p><p><strong>What impact will this merger have on the cannabis industry in Colombia?<br></strong>We are now the third-largest federally licensed cannabis company in the Western hemisphere and have plans to garner a significant market share in the global market. Clever Leaves is one of the few companies entirely focused on the cannabis market in countries other than Canada and the US, and there are only a handful of companies starting to focus on Europe or Colombia. As a pioneer in Colombia, Clever Leaves also has the capability to become one of the most sophisticated operators in Europe. For the industry, this means Colombian products will be in countries where cannabis is federally legal, including Germany, the largest medical cannabis market in Europe. </p><p><strong>How important is Colombia for the company and its global operations?<br></strong>Colombia represents more than 75% of our workforce and the majority of our pharmaceutical assets. We have a 1.8 million sqft cultivation facility near Bogotá and the only Good Manufacturing Practice-certified cannabis processing facility south of the US. These are important assets as they help position Colombia as a leader in the medical cannabis sector. Moreover, the lessons we have learned in Colombia will be critical for our expansion in Portugal. With two years of large-scale, sustainable cultivation, processing, and regulatory experience, we are also exporting knowledge to our operations in Colombia, Germany, the UK, and the US.</p><p><strong>Clever Leaves has invested around USD3 million in pharmaceutical and product development. What other strategic investments do you contemplate for the future?</strong><br>The company does not generally comment on specific investment opportunities, but we are always looking to expand our global reach. The main thrust of our current investments is around expanding in Colombia; establishing our operations in Portugal, where we own around 9 million sqft of agricultural property; and expanding our importation and distribution capabilities in Germany, where we have already made two investments.</p><p><strong>What positive impact has the company had on the communities where it works?<br></strong>For more than 100 years, cannabinoid therapies have been prohibited by law in many countries, and the potential for those products is slowly just being understood. This was the original reason for including the 'changing lives' part in our three-part mission statement: Cultivate mojo. Create value. Change lives. As we began to scale in Colombia, we recognized the impact of cannabis was even more profound. It was not just about creating a benefit for our potential customers or patients, but also about changing the fabric of the communities in which we operate. Some 70% of our cultivation teams near Pesca and Boyacá are women, and about half of these are single mothers.</p><p><strong>What are your projections for 2020 and the beginning of 2021?<br></strong>We want to develop an ecosystem of 100ha of greenhouse cultivation and matching extraction capabilities. We have also secured a 700-ha outdoor growing plot, which would positively impact our future projections. Additionally, as one of the few companies to have “pre-licensed" operations in Portugal, we hope to achieve full licensing and commercial sales in 2020. Our current focus is less on expanding capacity and more on utilizing our capacity via successfully expanding our global commercialization efforts. With that in mind, we are excited to begin sales in Germany in 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The orange economy was not well known until the current government made it one of its priorities. What advances have you made so far?<br></strong>We have a seven-pronged approach to develop the orange economy. The first is information, meaning we need to get a better understanding of the sector and its numbers both financially and non-financially. For that, we have been improving the scope of the culture satellite account and the orange economy. We have expanded the number of activities we follow and have been improving the methodologies so they can produce information more often. We are improving our ability to produce numbers in a prompter way and with greater priority. For that, we are working with the National Department of Statistics (DANE) and improving our understanding of local ecosystems. We have started city mapping the orange economy in a joint venture with Findeter. We have already completed two mappings and are undertaking another 12. By mid-2020, we will have a relatively accurate picture of the cultural scene and potential creative industries in the most important cities of the country together with an improved understanding of macroeconomic statistics. The orange economy currently contributes at least 3.2% to GDP, equivalent to about COP28.4 trillion (USD9 billion). It employs around 540,000 workers directly. Our expectation for the tenure of President Duque is to have a real growth of 35% or about COP38.1 trillion (USD11.24 billion). We expect to grow around 6% in 2019, 7% in 2020, and 9% in 2022 based on our observations from the sector's performance in 2018 compared to the rest of the economy as well as on the numbers reported by Confecámaras. We expect to grow much faster than the rest of the economy, so I would not be surprised if we saw the creation of another 160,00 creative jobs by the end of the Duque government.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about other approaches?<br></strong>The second approach is institutions. The Vice Ministry of Orange Economy and the National Council of Orange Economy were created in 2018. The council is presided over by several ministries and institutions. There are another 15 agencies and councillorships that support the council. Together, we run about 70 programs. Bancoldex found that in the first 12 months of the current administration, more than COP1 trillion in credit was allocated to creative industries, compared to COP680 billion over the last three years of the previous government. There has been 60-70% growth in the allocation of credit to this sector. That is what happens when there is institutional development and coordination, and this is even before the incentives kick in. Just this coordination alone has created an environment where people feel activated. The next element is infrastructure, which is usually the mid-point for non-core areas and is related to the next dimension: industry. We have established the concept of Orange Development Areas in the Bogotá Development Plan; it consists of creative clusters or districts where we, as a central government, can provide tax incentives. Companies enter these creative areas and provide faster internet access, better walkways, better parks, and theaters for artists to work and play. We want these areas to become magnets for talent. We are strongly linking creativity with tourism to try to help rebrand our country around our culture. Then, there is inclusion. We work hard to use culture to reduce gaps. It is also a good element to reassure the rights of ethnic communities. We are also seeing growing interest among former combatants to become a part of society. Finally, we have inspiration, which is about education, and in that we are working hard with the Ministry of Education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Khiron recently became the first Colombian company to export a cannabis-based cosmetic product line, Kuida, to the US. What does this milestone mean for your company?<br></strong>It means we are able to deliver on what we have promised to our investors, which is important at this point in our industry's development. Now, it is about building credibility with investors. Our focus is now on distribution, sales, channels, and investment, so we can grow our business in the US. Hopefully, our investors will look at the sales volumes of Kuida products and see if we can achieve the promise of a global brand. In other exciting news, the government is changing its hesitant stance on THC-based products. It is good to know that the government is finally moving ahead and realizing it needs to meet the milestones investors are waiting for. Getting the THC quota in order is positive and means we can start growing. Though the government's approval for THC-based products was important, we now have to work on getting the quotas for 2020.</p><p><strong>You recently opened a clinic called Zerenia. Can you tell us about the model for the clinics you operate?<br></strong>Our company believes in improving people's quality of life with the applied use of cannabis. That translates into what we want to build for our clinics, Zerenia in particular. Zerenia is an integrated care management clinic where we consider the trifecta of body, mind, and spirit. We are treating patients for conditions like chronic pain or epilepsy holistically. We believe cannabis is part of that trifecta; it is not the solution to every problem, but in integrated care, cannabis could be a major component for improving lives. There is nothing like Zerenia in Colombia or Latin America. We plan to open it hopefully by the beginning of 2020. It will treat conditions like chronic pain, dermatology, epilepsy, abnormal movements, and sleep deprivation. We hope to do two things through the clinic: show that medical cannabis can be a good medication for certain conditions and demonstrate that integrated care can create a strong relationship between Khiron and its patients.</p><p><strong>What are your current expansion plans in Latin America?<br></strong>In 2020, we want to focus on countries where favorable regulations are in place. That means Colombia is our number-one priority since it is closest to legalizing cannabis and ensuring we can start prescribing. In Mexico, there are still many steps needed to be able to sell. Our focus is on delivering what we promised patients in Colombia and focus on our Kuida sales in the UK and the US. Finally, we want to continue our process of understanding which countries in Latin America are ready for the sale of medical cannabis. We will focus on execution until that time. It is good that we have created an image of Khiron that will stay for a long time due to our investments in getting our name out to doctors. Good execution across the board will have a big say in 2020. As for the industry in Colombia, it would be great to see more companies on the sales and export sides. That would show investors and the community that faith in Colombia was well-placed. Worldwide, one expectation is Canada and its “Cannabis 2.0." We are waiting to see what happens with edibles, vaporizers, and so on. At present, Cannabis 1.0 has not been what everyone expected. If Cannabis 2.0 goes ahead and consumers start buying beverages, vaporizers, and topical products, and companies start generating good revenues, it will boost the industry. Overall, market dynamics play a role in valuations. Investors are waiting to see those dynamics go well before they choose which companies to invest in. Regardless, Khiron has to execute its business plan in Colombia. That is the only thing we can control. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What steps has the ministry taken to speed up the process to award new licenses for medical cannabis companies?<br></strong>The Ministry of Justice and Law has been working on several actions to reduce the waiting time required to obtain a license in their different modalities. These actions range from the correct preparation of the physical archive for each request, to the hiring of new personnel to evaluate each request. We have hired nearly 15 people, including documentation experts and lawyers. We have gone through special working days to support each of the procedures related to the licensing process for requests from 2018. As a result, we have been able to issue some licenses. The biggest challenge we face is the large number of requests. Notably, we provide training to people who wish to obtain a license in an attempt to reduce the error margin with the requests. This helps us to speed up the revision and awarding process. We have also developed and implemented a mechanism for cannabis control (MICC). It includes certain control mechanisms, as well as follow-up tools.</p><p><strong>What strategies have you implemented to guarantee legal security for international companies interested in Colombia?<br></strong>The government wants to modify the so-called Decree 613, by which we seek to increase legal security by strengthening legal and technical requirements to obtain licenses. This is done not only to maintain control around the entire process, but also to guarantee the profitability of foreign investment. Additionally, the training provided to our public officials provides them with tools to ensure they make the right decision and thus minimize the number of possible mistakes during the entire process to obtain a license. At present, Colombia has one of the most robust and complete legal frameworks and has been acknowledged as such by the global industry. The new decree, which will be published soon, will increase that international prestige. It will demonstrate the experience we have gathered in the last three years through Act 1787 from 2016, which allowed us to improve the rules of the game and boost the development of the cannabis industry.</p><p><strong>What are your views on medicinal cannabis not just for the national economy, but also as a way to position Colombia as a global leader?</strong><br>The interest of the industry to develop medicinal cannabis fills us with pride and pushes us to work every day to guarantee equal conditions for companies, supporting entrepreneurs who meet the security and quality conditions laid out by the government. The government's 100% backing has boosted the industry and made Colombia a leader in the medical cannabis space. In medical cannabis, we have a product that has been stigmatized for years and today represents a good possibility not only in terms of jobs, but also development and well-being for the entire society. We want to support entrepreneurs and generate a healthy level of competition. We expect this to attract more foreign investment.</p><p><strong>Medicinal cannabis is a growing industry in Colombia, and many sectors, including the government, are going through a learning process. What can other countries learn from Colombia?</strong><br>We have learnt that it is necessary to continue improving in legal areas as well as in technical parts and technological developments in order to keep up with the industry. The medical cannabis industry is a fast-changing market; therefore, decisions have to be made quickly. Equally important, we need to maintain a constant dialogue between government entities and the industry to identify the needs and adopt the required regulatory changes. It is crucial that the government considers new offers and proposals from the industry as long as they improve the regulatory framework and the overall sector. That is why we are currently working on a decree to amend the current regulation that would serve as a roadmap for the cannabis industry. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are you doing to promote specialized tourism categories throughout Colombia?<br></strong>We are working to promote sustainable tourism and ecotourism. We are mostly targeting the Japanese, North American, and South American markets because markets in Central America and the wider region are more interested in cities and shopping.</p><p><strong>How is Aviatur contributing to advancing corporate tourism in Colombia?<br></strong>We are aiding events and congresses in partnership with the International Congress and Convention Association. Colombia has excellent facilities for conventions and congress centers, as well as good hotels in all the major main cities. We have a department for incentives and are working with several organizations to plan corporate trips and create incentives. We decided to join the association on the back of better security and strong economic growth in Colombia.  At present, the country is also growing by 7.7%. Notably, Colombia is receiving more tourists from Mexico. This is a direct result of our decision to promote tourism in more areas.</p><p><strong>What has been your experience as CEO of Aviatur?<br></strong>There have been some positive changes. The peso has been devaluating, meaning the country is less expensive and easier to promote. It is important to improve Colombia's economic status, though it is even more important to improve the security situation. One of the best things to happen for the country was the peace agreement that was signed in 2016. We have to maintain the image of safety and make sure that all our promises and goals become a reality.</p><p><strong>How is Aviatur promoting Colombia abroad?<br></strong>For the past 52 years, we have been attending trade shows and exhibitions. We travel often to the UK, Germany, and the US. We have also been actively promoting online services and making improvements to our website in order to further grow in international markets. We have been growing in the Mexican market year after year. I was even surprised when I looked at the latest numbers. Our name is synonymous with reliability. Our customers know that they can count on us in the event of any problems.</p><p><strong>Are you targeting any particular countries?<br></strong>We are opening our website in many countries. The website will allow us to sell in more than 140 currencies. Opening our website in more countries is our business plan for 2020. Colombia has a highly qualified workforce, but people are not aware of that. We also plan to open our call centers in Colombia, in particular the new call center of AXA Assistance, our partner in assistance issues. More than 700 collaborators will work on the building of the call center. We are also promoting AXA Assistance in Central America and Ecuador.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020 and 2021?<br></strong>We want to grow our cargo and logistics operations. I have had the same plan for the past 52 years, which is to achieve perfection in every aspect of what we do. We will try to do our best to maintain equilibrium between all the segments. We might also look for a second luxury hotel. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[innovate-to-win]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Zurich has been in Colombia for five years. What is the strategic importance of the local market for its regional and global ambitions?<br></strong>Colombia is positioned as the fourth-most competitive country in Latin America, according to the World Economic Forum, and the fourth largest economy by GDP in the region. The insurance industry in Colombia has grown on average 9% over the past 10 years and it won't be the exception for the next 10 years. Direct presence in Colombia is key for the region and for the group as part of our strategy to keep working in order to strength the Zurich footprint, bringing to the market our expertise, knowledge, and capabilities, helping people and economies to grow. At the same time, we want to consolidate Zurich as a leading insurance company in Latam, and Colombia is a fundamental market in achieving that.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>At less than 3% of GDP, Colombia's insurance penetration remains low relative to other countries. What should be the strategy—for Zurich and for the insurance sector in general—to tackle this issue? What can be done to overcome the structural and cultural obstacles?</strong><br>3% of GDP insurance penetration is low indeed. This is not just because of per-capita income, or culture, or lack of insurance knowledge. I do believe that the insurance industry in general must be able to deliver to clients, as well as brokers and agents, a different kind of experience that allows us to build trusting relationships, making our services easy to process, buy, and pay for. On the other side, we need to deliver innovation and become digital. The world has changed rapidly in terms of customers and needs and we must not just adapt, but re-design the way we interact and offer value to clients.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy for increasing penetration, particularly for the SME and retail segments?<br></strong>Nowadays, the SME and retail segments need tailormade and simple products that include coverage for emerging risks in areas such as cybersecurity. We also need to protect mobility for individuals instead of just assets or services like telemedicine. Innovation and facilitating processes are our main strategy for increasing penetration.</p><p><strong>How is Zurich Colombia focused on bringing insurance innovation to the local market? <br></strong>Innovation is the key factor that, without a doubt, will help address the low penetration problem in Colombia. For instance, we recently launched a motor product that protects the owner of the vehicle, not just the vehicle. Our focus is to protect individuals while they are commuting within the city by car, cycle, scooter, or public transport, as the conditions of “new" cities demand it because of car usage restrictions, pollution reduction interest, the reduced time spent in transit, and so on. But at the same time it is the very first end-to-end digital product in Colombia, which means that the customer or agent can get an insurance policy document using his or her tablet, laptop, or smartphone, including services like virtual vehicle inspection, virtual adjustment of minor damages, payment of claim at the place of accident, and more. Our aim is to facilitate the customer's life, enhancing the insurance experience and making ourselves closer to clients and agents. This is an example of how innovation can help us. But our strategy is comprehensive and this is why we also think about our corporate segment (CI Insurance). We must be able to offer services adapted to large companies and industries, offering risk engineering services through our digital tools, for instance, facilitating and structuring international programs, adapting products and coverages to new needs, or helping our clients on the reinsurance side when for different circumstances we cannot help on the insurance side. It is about how we can make ourselves closer, present, and tangible for our clients.</p><p><strong>Zurich notably entered the Colombian market without first acquiring any local company, but you have since acquired QBE Seguros/ZLS Aseguradora de Colombia. What impact will this move have on your operations in Colombia?</strong><br>The acquisition of QBE positively impacted the Zurich regional operation in terms of scale and talent and Colombia is not the exception; We have integrated local knowledge and experience that allowed us to increase our product offering in the market.</p><p><strong>How do you see the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the Colombian insurance sector over the long term? <br></strong>COVID-19 is going to affect the insurance sector globally. As the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic continues, insurers are acting more flexibly than other industries in dealing with the adverse effects, thanks to their long-term vision. The same can be said for Zurich Seguros, which has implemented different actions in order to protect employees, clients, and brokers. The world will never be the same again, nor the way of relating to each other, nor the way of doing business even. This is not just related to the economic impact of the pandemic; it is about how we can be prepared for similar situations affecting the whole world and how private and public sector can work together to look for truly resilient economies and communities. </p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the remainder of 2020 and 2021?<br></strong>As insurance sector performance is directly related to the country's economy performance, my expectation is for a difficult 2Q and a 2H20 boosted by economic recovery. For 2021 I do believe that we will be able to return to the path of growth based on innovation focused on the customer, simplifying our business and operations while maintaining a sustainable business model that reinforces us as a trusted brand for our customers and stakeholders. Our solid financial position can reassure our customers that we will be there when they need us to handle their claims, and our shareholders that we are financially stable. It also gives us a well-earned positive reputation as a business and employer and positions us to invest in future growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the scale of your Colombian operations?<br></strong>Along with our own growing farm, we contract several local partners to grow our product. We currently have 12.1ha under cultivation, yielding a half-million flowers, and have the capacity and connections to scale up to 139ha and 5.5 million flowers. We have more than 180 cultivars in our seed bank from which we have developed 30 proprietary strains licensed for commercial cultivation, one of the mandatory requirements of the Colombian regulatory structure.<br>Having used a temporary extraction facility for the past three years, we are about to open the doors of a 2,300-sqm, GMP-certified processing and extraction center, where we will process oils at full scale. Once we become fully operational, we plan to produce 2,500kg of oil per month, or 30,000kg annually. </p><p><strong>How do you control the quality and mix of ingredients in your products?<br></strong>We have an excellent team of botanists breeding the strains, using natural irrigation and pest-control techniques. Our breeders have been able to develop cultivars with specific qualities and proportions of THC and CBD. Our local growers have extensive expertise. They treat the soil like a living organism and use no chemical pesticides or contaminants, resulting in healthy and safe plants and oils. Most cannabis oils are yellow, but our superior growth conditions yield antioxidant-rich oils with a reddish tint. </p><p><strong>PharmaCielo has recently begun selling in the B2B market. Can you give us some details?<br></strong>4Q2019 is when we flipped the switch to sales mode and announced a medicinal CBD sales agreement with a US distributor that started with an initial shipment of 1,000kg, with plans for continued volume shipments.  In early 2020, we announced distribution within the EU and ongoing discussions with a variety of additional global markets that would complement both, including Mexico, where we have an existing joint venture and will be able to act as soon as the government introduces new legislation. We have completed shipments to Switzerland and begun shipping introductory batches of product to various parts of the world, such as Argentina, Italy, and the Czech Republic, among others. </p><p><strong>How would you characterize PharmaCielo's business model?<br></strong>We are focused on the B2B market. We aim to produce the finest and most cost-effective cannabis ingredients—primarily CBD for now—and sell it to companies who will use our ingredients to make consumer-ready formulations. We see ourselves as the aloe vera of the cannabis industry. In other words, we supply a top-notch ingredient that other companies can put to a variety of creative and beneficial uses. A single kilogram of our oil translates into 3,000-5,000 SKUs, making it an attractive proposition for companies that develop consumer-ready formulations, particularly when complemented by the PharmaCielo Inside branding that they can license as a statement of quality for their products.</p><p><strong>Why did you choose Canada as your headquarters?<br></strong>Canada has high standards of financial accountability and oversight. Canada's well-regulated banking system makes it easy to conduct business, and capital markets in Canada made it possible for PharmaCielo to go public. By blending Canada's strengths with our core competencies in Colombia, we've taken the best of both worlds. In all, we view PharmaCielo's “dual citizenship" as one of our strongest assets and differentiators.</p><p><strong>Where do you see the company going in 2020 and 2021?<br></strong>2020 is our breakout year. We have devoted the past three years to fine-tuning cultivation and extraction and are ready to turn our attention to producing and selling our products. We will offer a range of oil products including a pure CBD oil, a broad-spectrum oil with THC removed, and a water-soluble CBD oil. Given our low costs, we anticipate a profit in our first year of commercialization. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does INVIMA seek to reduce waiting times and procedures in the medical sector?<br></strong>Digital transformation is also a tool to fight corruption and to be more transparent and efficient. Digital transformation affects our six regional offices. By restructuring all these regional offices, we seek to ensure that valuable entrepreneurs in the regions can access the sanitary registry through digital tools. Additionally, we need to generate partnerships with academia and other state institutions such as chambers of commerce. We are holding workshops in all the regions in order to improve the health sector. This includes training people and connecting them with regional entrepreneurs who are not fully aware of the effects of complying with sanitary standards on public health.</p><p><strong>How does INVIMA plan to continue increasing scientific rigor and vigilance, particularly in the field of medical cannabis and cannabis-based cosmetic products?</strong><br>INVIMA does not promote entrepreneurship, economic development, or anything similar. INVIMA is a health authority, and our interests do not always align with those of the private sector. The current government has a clear and defined policy regarding the use of medical cannabis. We respect the autonomy of nations that have accepted the use of recreational cannabis, though in Colombia, the use of cannabis is restricted to medicinal use. That does not prevent us from moving forward, for example, in something that the industry demands. In fact, we have already done it in the cosmetics sector, where there are more than 300 health records. Compared to other countries, Colombia has made great strides. There are certain business developments that we cannot ignore as long as we have a single roadmap based on scientific rigor. With science, we can define specific uses and a timely development of cannabis around the needs in the world of medicine. Colombia must hold on to scientific rigor to grow the cannabis industry. The country is a pioneer in regulatory matters in the region. INVIMA is seen as one of the most bureaucratic organizations, but that is because we want to ensure high standards of safety and efficiency; after all, our main purpose is to strengthen public health.</p><p><strong>How is INVIMA facilitating the success of the medical cannabis sector, and what are your short- and medium-term expectations about its role in the face of a rapidly developing market?</strong><br>I only see INVIMA in its role as health authority. Moreover, we have a standard that has advanced and cannot be stagnant. Colombia has to move ahead in issuing excellent manufacturing practices to make the market for master products a reality. In addition, we have to keep moving forward so that there is greater transformation and more physio-therapeutic products based on chemical synthesis and scientific rigor. The government is looking at how to promote the sector without neglecting public health interests.<br> <br><strong>How does Colombia's medical cannabis industry stand in comparison to the region? <br></strong>The majority of establishments I visited in Canada belong to investors that are also present in Colombia, so there is transparency of knowledge and technology, which gives us peace of mind as a health authority. The rigor I saw in Canada around production is extremely high.<br>  <br><strong>As one the most important authorities in Colombia, what is your outlook for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>Essentially, we seek to build prestige. To have prestige, society must recognize it. We promote and protect public health by monitoring products that people use and consume on a daily basis. This recognition is the most important and is achieved through transparency, efficiency, and safety. We have advanced significantly in the area of food, cosmetics, and medical devices. Notably, we have facilitated some procedures and also eliminated others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[harnessing-the-entrepreneurial-mentality]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of the sectors you are tackling and your current objectives?<br></strong>We have been a part of the Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela region for the last 35 years. Our core business is industry, though mining and construction have also been growing rapidly. In some countries such as Chile, our main business is mining, though in others mining is still in early stages. We are bringing our customers something called sustainable profitability. We want to provide our customers with peace of mind. We have worked hard in R&amp;D to develop one of the most sustainable products worldwide. Our products for the medical industry add value for our customers, though we are also in assembly, food and beverage, textile, and manufacturing. Every car produced worldwide has USD2-3 of Atlas Copco equipment. We have been trying to adapt that concept in the Colombian industry to provide added value that changes the technology. It is important for us to be the partner of choice with a greater focus on quality. Beyond that, we want to provide the entire scenario of products for our customers. We have many products, but want to concentrate on the sustainable profitability concept.</p><p><strong>What is your main competitive advantage?<br></strong>It is an extremely competitive world. We want to provide cheaper and faster options to generate savings for our customers. If we reduce the cost of energy in our plant, then we can reduce production costs and become more competitive. For the textile industry in Europe or the US, its main competitor is Asia. The best way to compete with those markets is by boosting efficiency. At present, we are producing nitrogen and oxygen with the highest standards worldwide. It is safe, cheap, and fast.</p><p><strong>How do you maintain industrial growth by ensuring an environmentally friendly service?<br></strong>It is part of our job to teach the market. If something launches in Germany, tomorrow it will be here. The Colombian market is hungry for new developments. Our mission is to teach clients how to use new technology. We are building a new standard in the industry. If we educate our clients to be more environmentally friendly, we can establish new standards in the industry. The Colombian market is adapting quickly to these new technologies.</p><p><strong>What new products have potential in the Colombian market?<br></strong>We have seen many different dimensions, not merely products but also services. Two years ago, we introduced a concept known as the 'air plan,' which is the same concept as paying for electricity and water. I sell customers the air they need in their plant, while all the maintenance is in our hands. It is a holistic product, with great acceptance in the Colombian market. We launched it in Medellí­n, and there is interest from companies like Eternit or Tostado. This is an extremely huge project. We provide a service for 24 hours. We were the first to introduce this comprehensive concept in the market, which in the end saves our clients a large sum of money. We can adapt our product to the specific needs of customers, as it is fairly flexible.</p><p><strong>The industry in Colombia is expected to expand due to new incentives. What main opportunities does this bring to your company?</strong><br>The global economy is having a tough moment, though Colombia continues to be an attractive market. We have started a transformation in the so-called 'orange economy,' and we can become a key player for the transformation. We have some areas to improve, like security, though the country is on the right path. The main burden at the moment are taxes and the difficulty of setting up a new company. Colombians have an entrepreneurial mentality. Young people create new products and companies, and the recent tax reduction will play a key role. We have to become more agile in digital areas. We need to improve in creating companies and have to be more attractive to bring in investors. I see many opportunities in industry and exports like textiles, the orange economy, and digital media. Mining was our most important market, though industry is growing, and Colombia has become a hub of sorts for the Atlas Copco market. Our market is larger than Argentina, Venezuela, or Peru. Colombia is the most important Latin American country not in terms of revenue, but potential.</p><p><strong>What are your perspectives for Atlas Copco in Colombia?<br></strong>We are a professional company, have an excellent position in the market, and are proud to showcase the latest technologies and provide great services and different solutions for our customers. We are working hard to establish an engineering company to support our clients. The goal is to expand our office, which is embedded in our customers' facilities. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of Pernod Ricard's latest achievements, operations, and highlights in the Colombian market?<br></strong>The Colombian market is growing rapidly, but we are growing faster. We are the second-largest player in Colombia and have been gaining market share for the past two years. In terms of dynamics, most of the liquor market here is made up of local products, such as aguardiente and rum. A third of the market comprises imported products. As for imported products, more than two-thirds is whisky, and Scotch is also huge. What we have been seeing in recent years is that imported products are growing faster than aguardiente and rum. There has been a fall in their share and an increase in imported products, with whisky a clear winner. We are growing faster than the market overall.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about the development of your brands in Colombia and whether there is potential in the corporate market?<br></strong>The potential is huge. The priority for us is Chivas. It is the leader when we talk about our whisky portfolio. Whisky is the third-biggest player in the market, but is growing rapidly. We have been introducing Chivas Regal Extra over the past two years with a great deal of success. Historically, we had Chivas 12 and Chivas 18. We launched Extra in 2017, not to mention the Glenlivet range of single malts. It is our second-most active brand in the market and is growing quickly. </p><p><strong>What is your approach with the Olmeca brand from Mexico?<br></strong>One of the new dynamics in the market is the growth of tequila. When we talk about imported products, whisky was usually the first, followed by vodka, tequila, and gin. Now, we have whisky and then tequila. Tequila is much bigger than vodka and is the fastest-growing category in imported brands, even faster than whisky. With Olmeca, we have a solid player in the premium level and main market. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you describe Diageo's Colombia operations and its potential in comparison to the rest of the region?<br></strong>From here, we manage the entire Andean region of Venezuela and Colombia. This is a pivotal moment for Colombia, one of considerable foreign investment and many expectations within the scope of Latin America. Colombia is the only nation that is growing at 3% per annum. While this may not sound too impressive, other nations are flat, or even in recession, making us the rising star. International spirits represent less than 3% of the alcoholic beverage market. Therefore, the opportunity for any company that has the right portfolio and the right brands to win consumers is massive. We represent a 70% share of the international spirits market, and that varies between whisky, vodka, and so on. The game is not about continuing to increase shares in a highly niche game, but disrupting receptive consumers by offering new brands and experiences. Alcohol consumers in Colombia are used to hard liquor, rum, and beer. But now, thanks to the internet, they are more open to experimenting with something different. Our portfolio is in a unique position to capitalize on that opportunity. Over the past two years, we have been working to bring disruptive propositions to these consumers with the right access. The combination right now is an innovative agenda with a more diverse portfolio of different price points. We have been growing, during the past two years, at 19% on our top line, and our expectation is to continue that trajectory at least for the next four or five years in the high double digits. We expect this to be the case across the industry. These are exciting times, and we need to do whatever is possible to maximize our legacy. We want to modernize the alcohol industry in Colombia from a regulatory and taxation perspective, as well as whatever else it takes.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about your process of identifying the right portfolio and the right brands?<br></strong>It is a combination of truly understanding the consumer and the landscape. When you are the leader, with a 70% market share, it is possible to become complacent and lose sight of the consumer's perspective. Therefore, we have developed a more granular understanding of diverse consumer motivation, depending on location, be it the home, or socializing in a casual or formal dining environment. Comprehending motivation and product selection criteria require this approach. That is why we invest time and money into a long-term strategy in response.</p><p><strong>Which of your brands is best positioned in Colombia?<br></strong>All of them really, because of the sheer opportunity in the market. The top five brands in our portfolio are all scotch. There are brands like Buchanan's that, at this moment, is the leader of the deluxe segment. Then, there is Old Parr and Johnny Walker. We launched Black &amp; White to give consumers price accessibility with a great quality proposition. We also launched Gordon's gin, as gin is becoming a trend the world over that will soon come to Colombia. So, we decided to invest ahead in a category that still has a small niche, and we are the only ones taking that bet. Then, we launched Smirnoff X1, which is flavored vodka, and the first international brand being produced in Colombia. We did that last year and decided to work together with Empresa de Licores de Caldas. We invested more than COP4 billion in the factory to make sure we are not just having them as a co-packer, but also transferring the knowledge of a premium spirits producer to a local entity to elevate the quality of local products. So, we have been investing in different brands, segments and categories where we see potential. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What determining factors have helped Postobón remain a leader in the Colombian beverage industry since its establishment?</strong>Postobón has been in the market for about 115 years and has had a clear passion and agenda based on innovation. We have been bottling and packaging different products that today are considered “new age" but, for us, are centenary products. Our success has been based on innovation, products, flavor, packaging, distribution, and our market channels. We have a solid distribution system that helps us to continue building our leadership and multi-category platform. That is why we consider our leadership strong, and we will continue in the same way in the coming years.</p><p><strong>What does it mean to be recognized as the best bottling company in Latin America by PepsiCo, and what is your strategic alliance?</strong><br>Globally, we were recognized as the best in Latin America. We then competed in an open discussion with PepsiCo on its global franchise program, and it recognized us as the best in the world. We are not the biggest; we are the best-performing bottler in the year with execution, innovation, and an agenda of digital transformation. We have a robust relationship with PepsiCo, as we are closely aligned with its brands. We have our own brands, but we have the franchise, and PepsiCo recognizes Postobón's great execution of its agenda.</p><p><strong>You also have an agreement with United Brewing Company (CCU) Chile. How strategic are these agreements, and are you looking for further alliances?</strong><br>In 2016, we drafted our agenda for the future where we outlined our plan to transform the company into a multicategory company, beyond the traditional soft drink products we sell in the market. We wanted to penetrate the market with different products, like beer and malt. With our own new brands, like Andina in beer and Nutrimalta in malt, we decided to enter into a 50-50 partnership with CCU. We are making progress every day according to our objectives. We will continue making more investments in the industry to achieve our long-term objectives. We are open to continuing to explore new opportunities because the multicategory is far beyond what we used to do and goes beyond beer and malt. We have a huge platform and a powerful distribution network that we want to continue to take advantage of and capture value in the market.</p><p><strong>What role does innovation and technology play in your production process?<br></strong>Everything is based on those two concepts. Innovation has to be present in everything we do. We will not have a “copy-paste" of a product. Innovation and digital transformation will play an integral role in the future of the company. Digital transformation is happening today in our company, and we are putting important capital investment behind that agenda. Hopefully, in the near future, we will conquer new markets based on technology. That is a fundamental part of our agenda today, and it will be more relevant by the day.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for Postobón in the coming years?<br></strong>We continue to be optimistic and believe Colombia is a great place to invest. Consumption is moving forward in this country, and with more people entering the middle class, we see consumption of many different products expanding. This will continue to happen in the near future, and we want to capture that opportunity. We want to continue to invest. We have a robust capital investment program through which we will continue investing in the country, expanding in capacity and distribution. We can continue expanding with double-digit growth in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has Colombia represented in your portfolio of operations?<br></strong>Launched at the end of 2018, Colombia is one of our newest and most exciting offices, given that Colombia inspired the BMI Companies' founder to set up his own company. Our outlook on the market is positive; Colombia has one of the best growth trajectories in the region. The country is also politically stable, with a growing middle class and share of individual life policies with respect to GDP, providing a huge opportunity to penetrate the local market. In a few years, we expect our operations here will represent the biggest market for BMI. Currently, our largest market is Ecuador, where we now have three local offices: Cuenca, Guayaquil, and Quito.</p><p><strong>After different alliances, how have users managed to expand their range of insurance service options?<br></strong>We are constantly working to improve the experience of our customers. This translates into strategic alliances that allow focusing on greater insight and greater knowledge. How do we do it? A fundamental pillar is collaborative synergies to complement services based on each company's know-how and specialty. We are looking for business partners to jointly leverage sales with the single purpose of strengthening the value proposition. There are ways to penetrate the market and expand the knowledge of our products. Another equally important way is through continued training of advisors on our products. Finally, our suppliers become a strategic ally, as they are responsible for service to our customers. This means that well-made agreements, constant monitoring, and supervision are fundamental pieces in guaranteeing our valued products.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to launch new products in the individual life and health segment? <br></strong>In 2019, BMI Colombia launched different products, including Universal Individual Life — NOVA. The Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia was also authorized for the new life group product, and we adapted the individual health product to the local market with local coverage to meet customers' needs. Before creating entirely new products, it is important to look at current BMI products and see how they can be revised for the Colombian market. Our focus has to be on improving processes to achieve the best response and quality for our sellers and customers. We are constantly looking for new opportunities for this market, and when we do, we implement them immediately once they have been deemed viable by our technical and marketing departments.</p><p><strong>What is your percentage breakdown between personal and corporate policies? <br></strong>For us, the individual and corporate market are completely different, but they complement each other, strategically speaking. Currently, our corporate participation is greater than the individual. The individual segment tends to have a slower growth trajectory than the corporate one. In the medium term, it will balance out.</p><p><strong>When it comes to premium and corporate services, how do you ensure you attract the right customers and future partnerships? <br></strong>We have clear product segmentation, and we know exactly what the profile of our clients is, both individual and corporate. These profiles are constantly transmitted to our salesforce. Meanwhile, all our strategic clients go through a strict filter and risk analysis process, ensuring they are in line with our company standards.</p><p><strong>After a direct investment of USD28 million, how have you managed to increase direct job generation? How does this contribute to actions of corporate social responsibility?</strong><br>As a young and growing company in the Colombian market, we have increased our direct job placements by at least 70%. Our human resources department continues searching for additional personnel, as demand continues to increase due to our commercial sales growth. As the salesforce grows, we continue to hire in the operational and administrative departments to best support our personnel in the commercial areas. Today, we have more than 300 independent consultants with whom we have delivered excellent insurance plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does Colombia represent for the bank as a whole?<br></strong>It is an opportunity that explains BNP Paribas' growth since its inception in 1972, specifically in the last 10-12 years. The Pacific Alliance is also important. If we combine the Pacific Alliance's economies, the result is the world's seventh-largest economy, with 200 million people and a growing population. Our customers want to see and have financial providers that have a presence across countries that comprise the Pacific Alliance: Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile.</p><p><strong>What is your approach to the bank's different clients, ranging from entrepreneurs and institutions to SMEs and large companies?<br></strong>As a bank, we have individual clients through insurance companies and our partners in our partner banks of Cadiz and retailers. In terms of banking activity, ours are mainly corporate and financial institutions. Moving forward, we want to work with multinational companies with global strategic clients of the bank that are entering the country. FDI in 2019, especially at the start, was diverse in terms of country of origin. Another 2019 development was Chinese investment, which is a trend that will continue.</p><p><strong>Will China work with other financial institutions or will it bring its own financial institutions for assistance?<br></strong>Both, for two reasons. China has strong banks, though depending on the industries it enters, it is better to have peso-linked financing; otherwise, it will either be too burdensome or too costly. But we also have strong local banks in Colombia with excellent services. The financing needs in Colombia are so large that there will be room for our colleagues to work, including unilateral entities, international banks, and local banks. A project like Metro Bogotá—considered to be Colombia's largest for the next five years—needs financing from several funding pools. 6<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What services differentiate your hospital?<br></strong>We cater to the adult population and do not offer antenatal or pediatric services. We are particularly focused on neurosciences and deep neurostimulation, having also gained a reputation in neurosurgery. We perform the highest number of surgeries in Colombia and are also renowned for our orthopedic services. We are also strong in urology, oncology, and HIV, an area we entered in 1991.</p><p><strong>What strategies are you implementing to up your technological strength?<br></strong>The institution formerly had software developed in-house, but the programming language was not particularly compatible with our system. Today, we operate new software that connects all the information within the system, and the overarching goal is to become a digital, paperless hospital. Colombian regulation says the clinical history of the patient belongs to the insurance company. We seek to move the equipment for leasing or other financial services to be able to update it. Most of our professionals are used to being hired based on per-service contracts, and it is a challenge to change the system. It is difficult, for example, to tell a plastic surgeon to become a regular employee if it is more lucrative not to do so.</p><p><br><br><br>What is the potential of the medical tourism sector in Colombia?<br>Hospitals and clinics in Colombia are known for offering competitive prices and excellent quality. More and more people are choosing Colombia for cosmetic surgeries. Our institution, however, is not that focused on those services, although we can provide them. The main problem is that foreign insurance services do not cover patients in Colombia. We would require a regulation for the rates we can charge foreign patients. Also, there have to be advances in terms of language skills to be able to provide more bilingual services. All health institutions have to hold discussions in order to agree on the areas we will individually focus on. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the main strengths of the fiduciary services industry in Colombia?<br></strong>Without a doubt, the industry's main appeal is its maturity, which is what makes our clients trust us and feel safe. On the other hand, having robust regulations that cover tax, financial, and advertising issues, and set clear rules for us as managers have a positive impact and protect the interests of our investors. Our industry is monitored by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia, which also promotes excellent practices. Currently, assets managed by trust companies account for about 60% of the country's GDP and play a key role in many types of projects nationwide. Finally, the industry has been evolving and adapting to global trends, especially in terms of the digitalization of financial products to facilitate access and optimize processes. These features make the sector competitive and prioritize end consumers.</p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on Colombia's economic situation and the opportunities for Fiduoccidente in that regard? <br></strong>In 2019, Colombia's economy performed well overall, with GDP growth of 3.3% amid a global and regional slowdown where the global economy grew at its lowest rate since the 2008 crisis. Investments in our country grew by 4.6%, a figure not seen since 2014. Measures such as the Tax Reform and the Development Plan involving 4G roadworks exceeded expectations, and the imports of machinery and construction equipment led to excellent results in terms of investment. At this time of strong economic outcomes and significant demand for development in infrastructure and other sectors, Fiduoccidente plays a role as a highly mature partner with the experience and credentials necessary to set up a highly favorable environment for investors and developers intending to bet on one of the driving industries in the Colombian economy: infrastructure. </p><p><strong>How did Fiduoccidente evolve in 2019?<br></strong>We significantly increased our assets under management in our mutual funds (FIC) by 25%. This increases our investors' confidence and is proof of our ability to meet our clients' specific needs and help them reach their goals. Additionally, we doubled profits compared to 2018, increased revenue by almost 15%, and established ourselves as one of the leading players in the private equity fund management industry in the country. We also strengthened our new strategic approach by market type, which allowed us to focus on clients over products. This strategy led to a 15% increase in our client base and the consolidation of an integrated business model with Banco de Occidente, our parent company. Through our digital transformation projects, we managed to position ourselves as a leading trust company. We achieved this through product launches, which included Fiduinversión, a digital platform that allows clients to trade between their funds and accounts. Finally, we obtained the ISO 27001 certification, which is vital in matters of client information security. We are the only financial institution in the country that has it.</p><p><strong>What are Fiduoccidente's plans for 2020 and the upcoming years?<br></strong>Our plans are to dream big and reach high-impact goals alongside individuals and businesses. We aim to increase the size of our FICs by about 10% and reach COP3 billion in assets under management in our private equity funds. We launched three unique new funds for the market that operate under a multi-fund structure. These funds, in turn, invest in other local or foreign funds. With this model, we can diversify the portfolio even further and offer access to different alternatives through a single product with interesting returns. In 2Q2020, we will launch the first digital initiative developed in Aval Digital Labs, which will allow clients to join us without the physical intervention of our sales team and without having to fill out any documents. In short, our plans for 2020 are to continue delivering our value proposition for our partners while strengthening it through new disruptive tools that involve an improvement in the experience and service we offer. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are your main focuses?<br></strong>One of our main focuses and what we have been working on for 20 years is the generation of energy via conventional fuels. We generate it with diesel, a refined fuel; crude, which comes directly from the earth; and gas. We have also been using unconventional renewable energies for five years.</p><p><strong>Which industries do you work with, and who are your clients?<br></strong>We work with the oil industry and almost all the operators in the country. One of our main clients was Pacific Rubiales, which we worked with for 11 years. In 2016, we terminated the contracts with them. Four or five years ago, we were dispersed in most of all the oil fields of Colombia.</p><p><strong>There is the possibility of approaching the public sector and cities to begin to implement your technology around renewables. Could you tell us a little more about this?<br></strong>Colombia is experiencing an energy crisis that will further develop with time. We have been studying and analyzing it for almost five years to determine how we can provide renewable and unconventional energy to industries and cities, leading them to gradually develop in industries on the governmental part. We hope that cities develop modern energy infrastructure so they can become self-sustainable.</p><p><strong>How significant are innovative solar energy projects for the future of the country?<br></strong>Here at the company we have a photovoltaic facade with glass. We produce 32kB of installed capacity, and the most important thing about it is the contribution we are making to the environment from a small area. We have a saving of 24,000kg of CO2 per year. We see ourselves as the leaders in renewable energy in the near future. It is important that Colombia starts developing renewable energy.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to look for solutions to increase the amount of drinking water that Colombians have access to, and how is this related to the generation of energy and the use of natural resources?<br></strong>We have done studies in the Caribbean region and Boyacá, which are quite rich in water. But abundant water does not mean it is drinkable and good for the human body. To further this research, we have allied with other countries and solar generation modules that also capture solar energy and accumulate it. We plan to develop simple modules to bring drinking water to more remote places.</p><p><strong>What is the added value of Power Group in the market?<br></strong>Our added value is bringing innovation and development to provide better services to our customers. We have qualified personnel traveling the world, visiting the best industries, fairs, and companies to capture state-of-the-art synergies, test them, and then develop them in Colombia.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>Developing projects is our main goal. KfW Development Bank has donated some modules that we must install in conflict zones such as Caquetá, Tolima, and Urabá. Initially, we plan to bring energy where it does not exist and start its development in these areas so that these communities start receiving help. We are investing knowledge and money in technology tests to be leaders of renewable energy at the national and Central American level. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[clean-up-duty]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the state of environmental consulting in Colombia?<br></strong>There was no clear regulation for this matter in Colombia until 10 years ago. We had an operation in Magdalena Medio with a project that was managed by a US-based company later taken over by Ecopetrol. The previous operator did not take the necessary environmental measures, so we used our technology to do a proper clean up. The National Agency for Environmental Licenses (ANLA) and corporations currently have an inventory of over 10,000 environmental passives, but unfortunately, there is no law that forces them to it clean it up. It is an important market, but it is unregulated.</p><p><strong>What does Colombia represent for the company, and how easy has it been to position your technology in Colombia?<br></strong>Colombia represents around 60% of our operations. Our company is present in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, and Argentina. It has not been easy to position because the technology is a bit expensive. There are local technologies that try to do the same at 30% of the cost; however, our technology is more efficient in the long term. We manage traditional processes such as cleaning, recollection, extraction, and transportation. In general, we work on contingencies, clean ups, and domestic water treatment. The focus in Panama is storage tanks in water plants. We work with Oil Spill Eater (OSE) II to lower the percentage of oils and reduce around 90% of contaminants in the water. It is used in chicken farms, for example. We worked with the aqueduct of Panama to treat sewage water. We also worked with a service station that had some damaged tanks. </p><p><strong>How did you start offering your services to companies like Ecopetrol, Parex, Ismocol, and Vetra?<br></strong>Our first strategy was to offer a pay-per-view model. We offered to do all the treatment on a certain proposed budget, and the client paid us only if we managed to do a proper clean-up. That is how we started. At present, we have ongoing contracts, and they call us when they have a contingency. We are the second respondent in these situations. The first respondents are the companies that have plants close to the disasters. We have partnerships with companies that are based all over the country. We mainly work with geoparks on this.</p><p><strong>What is your relationship with companies such as Verde, Gpower, and OSE?<br></strong>There are six representatives in Latin America for the OSE II technology. Traecol has plants in 12 cities; they are our first respondents, and they only use our technologies. Verde has a technology similar to ours, but it does not provide the same experience. Verde has other lines of business for water treatment, and it applies the product to golf courses or football fields to grow grass. Gpower is our ally in Ecuador, and we have been working with it since 2017. </p><p><strong>Do you have the positive outlook for the sector shared by the National Agency of Hydrocarbons (ANH) and Ecopetrol?<br></strong>The current administration has put forward new oil blocks. During the last round, it offered 50 blocks, but the previous administration did not offer any blocks, mainly due to low investment. Long-term investments are coming in due to these new offers because what is assigned today will be profitable in around five years. ANH should focus more on the environment, because at present it is only focused on exploration and production. <br> <br><strong>What will be the main strategies to attract new allies or clients?<br></strong>We want to focus mainly on operators, showing them our results and reductions in costs. We are the only multinational company with global experience in clean up and contingencies that has a presence in Colombia. The country has a great deal of experience in these types of contingencies, but the methods used here are traditional and archaic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[taking-action-now]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has characterized the company as a successful one in the Colombian market?<br></strong>We have always thought business must be a win-win situation. If the client feels that the product is good, they will buy more. They want a company that generates trust, and to be successful, it is important that the business is focused on delivering proper results to the client. By doing so, you will win in many ways, not just money.</p><p><strong>Through which project have you managed to impact and change lives?<br></strong>Through our goal of teaching people a new way of business, we are focusing on showing other ways to achieve successful lives. For example, in Medellí­n, we have helped many people in Comuna 13. There was a young girl who came up to me when we were doing a project there and told us that our paints saved her life. Despite her history of abuse, through our gallons of paints, she focused on creating murals to overcome that past. Now, she is teaching other girls in the comunas that they must be respected. We were also part of a Noble Prize event where we supported the event through a video educating assistants about the importance of forgiveness, peace, and how Pinturas Tito Pabón is contributing to this goal. </p><p><strong>What is your current strategy to further increase the company's recognition?<br></strong>In line with the company's good practices, I conducted studies on some 50 high-profile Latin American CEOs at Berkeley. In addition, I had the opportunity to talk to them about the UN's SDGs, the quality of focus Tito Pabón has put on these concerns, and our commitment to the basic principles of those goals. It was a great opportunity to show our effort to help the environment by reducing the toxicity of each product we design. At Tito Pabón, we are more committed than ever to the environment, families, and the health of all. The message is clear: industrial companies must treat the planet better and put forth their best effort to produce non toxic products and increase quality, all without affecting the client's budget. We need to do our best to reduce our impact on the environment and people, and at Tito Pabón we are not tired of doing this.</p><p><strong>What actions demonstrate Tito Pabon's commitment to the environment?<br></strong>We are upgrading our fleet of trucks to a fleet of electric vehicles. In this way, we will be one of the few to have only electric vehicles in 2020. Additionally, we are focused on reducing the amount of plastic considerably in our products, especially compared to what is offered on the market. To do this, we are making many changes, of which I am extremely proud. At Tito Pabón, we are sure that this green way is the ideal path and we are excited to take action in areas necessary to be more aligned with the SDGs. We have had the support of designers hired in Switzerland to innovate our packaging and focus on an ecological design.</p><p><strong>What will be the approach for 2020 and upcoming years to continue being one of the most exemplary companies in the country?<br></strong>The task does not end, and we must always stay ahead. We have also focused on purchasing recycled furniture and on manufacturing recycled pillows. The point here is to reuse everything we have available. Additionally, we are in the process of launching a digital TV channel on which we will talk about issues surrounding the circular economy, the environment, and good practices. The name of the channel will be Tito TV, and we have people from several universities we want to count on to contribute. We also want to launch TV programs, such as Property Brothers to encourage the transformation of lives<br>and homes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What sectors currently drive the growth of the Colombian economy?<br></strong>The main sectors driving the expansion of economic activity are public administration, educational and healthcare services, retail sales, manufacturing, and professional and scientific services. Public administration growth is explained by higher execution of local and regional public projects, the one-off shock brought by the national census conducted every 10-15 years and the presidential elections, and the progress made by investment projects financed with resources from royalties. In addition, retail sales also significantly contribute to economic growth. This sector's growth is driven by higher consumer confidence, which was extremely low in 2017, lower inflation, and the 2018 biannual vehicle fair. Manufacturing also had great expansion rates, driven in particular by higher household consumption on food and beverage, the external winds that favored the demand of textiles, and greater production of capital goods and oil-refined products.</p><p><strong>The government has expressed its commitment to meeting the fiscal rule. How important is it for the economy to meet the target deficit of 2.4% as set out by the fiscal rule?<br></strong>A sound Colombian macroeconomic framework has established important backing for economic prosperity and market credibility. Despite undergoing one of the largest terms-of-trade shocks in the region in 2014-2016, the economy maintained moderate growth rates. Our commitment to solid fiscal management, with revenue and spending adjustments, will continue, despite the challenges associated with the costs of Venezuelan immigration and budgetary rigidities. The reduction of fiscal deficit is consistent with the fiscal targets set by the Fiscal Rule, which will help stabilize and reduce the government's debt burden in the following years. In this context, the importance of complying with the Fiscal Rule—in general of a prudent macroeconomic policy framework—relies on the ability to maintain access to capital markets that underpin private and public investment to foster solid economic growth.</p><p><strong>What major structural issues affecting the economy does the ministry plan to address through policy in the coming years?<br></strong>One important challenge that has to be addressed is the Venezuelan crisis. The combination of an economic slump in the neighboring country affects Colombia negatively via weaker external demand and higher fiscal costs associated to migration flows. Meanwhile, Colombia remains on the front lines responding to the severe humanitarian emergency in Venezuela. Remarkably, more than 1 million migrants from Venezuela currently reside in Colombia, and many more have either transited through the country or crossed the border temporarily. Colombia has demonstrated an unwavering commitment to providing humanitarian support such as healthcare, education, as well as granting labor rights to migrants to integrate them into the economy. The associated fiscal costs are estimated to be around 0.5% of GDP in the near term. In addition to the migration issue, we highlight the importance of increasing the total factor productivity to narrow the negative output gap. A scenario of strong economic recovery in Venezuela, a lower tax burden for corporates from the Financing Law, and a more efficient public spending will foster productivity as well as medium and long-term economic growth.  </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>AES is building the largest self-generation solar park in Colombia. What does this mean for the company, and how does it position it in the market?</strong><br>Castilla Solar Park is the largest self-generation solar project in Colombia. We have been in a process of transforming a great company that owns 1,020MW of Colombia's hydro facilities into a portfolio of energy solutions that include different renewable technologies. We are not only talking about water, but also solar, wind, and batteries. 2019 was important because we consolidated that transformation. One of the key projects is Castilla Solar. But even more important is our project with Ecopetrol, the state-owned oil company. We have a long-term PPA with Ecopetrol that facilitates the development of these renewable projects, creating a great precedent for other companies in Colombia. This project will help Ecopetrol replace part of its energy matrix with cleaner energy and cut 154,000 tons of CO2 emissions. It will provide significant savings for Ecopetrol, around 30% in the energy produced at the Castilla oil field. AES Colombia is currently working to provide sustainable and competitive energy solutions to the most important consumers in Colombia.</p><p><strong>Why did you acquire Cold Wind, which had an energy project in Colombia's north? <br></strong>We want to ensure we develop the most sustainable and competitive portfolio in Colombia. We did plenty of analysis of how we could combine Chivor's hydro plant with other types of technologies to make ours the country's most sustainable and competitive portfolio. What we found is that wind and hydro make the perfect match. We explored multiple alternatives and found that the best wind was in La Guajira region, so we acquired Jemeiwaa Kai, the country's largest wind development project. With Jemeiwaa Kai, we won 29% of the government's tender auction, making AES one of Colombia's main players in the energy transformation space. In order to develop projects, it is important to have long-term contracts, which is a key element that the Colombian market doesn't have. Under the leadership of Minister of Energy Marí­a Fernanda Suárez, we had the first long-term contract auctions in Colombia and the opportunity to start building the future of energy in Colombia. </p><p><strong>You signed a contract with Gensa to sell unconventional energy for 15 years. Which other companies might you work with in the future?</strong><br>What differentiates us is that we want to work with our clients to provide energy solutions. We are working with large commercial and industrial users, both for grid and on-site energy. We are also working with wholesale companies like Gensa that want to have renewable energy to rebalance their portfolio. We also work with distribution companies. Utility companies were our main buyers in this renewable auction, so we have a product that is not only 100% renewable, but also complementary and competitive for the Colombian market.</p><p><strong>The energy sector has historically been composed of men. What campaigns are you carrying out to involve women?<br></strong>The percentage of men in this sector is around 90%. We had a great experience in Castilla Solar Park. The expectation was that 95% of the workforce was going to be men. Through working with our contractors, we saw the possibility of involving women in the construction process. As a result, more than 100 people, 29% of the total workforce, were women. It was nice because for many of them it was their first job. They felt proud to be part of a project that reflects the energy transformation of a whole country. AES is committed to the inclusion of women in the energy sector, and we expect to have more female workers at all levels in our organization. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What can we do to enhance education offered here and worldwide?<br></strong>Firstly, working on education is endless and rewarding. There is much we can do to enhance education, especially as new technologies disrupt our way of life and traditional ideas of education. Education will have to go through a disruption, and a new model of teaching is needed, particularly in the way we deliver education. I am a strong believer in online teaching, not only at the university level, but also at lower levels. Gone are the days when you had to feed students with information. We must provide them with the medium, and they should be able to extract information while we guide them where to go for information. We may reduce our classroom hours and allow more free time for our students to become explorers, rather than being in a classroom passively absorbing information. This will also bring the cost of teaching down; we will no longer need huge classes to deliver those lessons. Universities will have to offer some classes, courses, and degrees online. There is a resistance from traditional professors and universities that believe you have to have a physical campus and eye contact with your professors. There is a role for traditional education delivery, but not 100%. I want to see at least 10% of outside-the-classroom study. Today, there is so much material available outside the classroom. It is about bringing live, practical cases from the real world to students and giving them opportunities to learn individually. As for Dubai leading the region, we have started great initiatives, from Dubai Care to the Maktoum Charity Foundation. It would be nice if all philanthropists on the private side could also get together and share their opinions and experience.</p><p><strong>You are one of the first to promote the private sector's involvement in refugee education. What is your message to the private sector, and how is your fund looking to collaborate further with the private sector?</strong><br>I went public with the Abdul Aziz Al Ghurair Refugee Education Fund to showcase there are good, genuine people doing philanthropic activities and willing to talk about them. Typically, people do not like to talk about this. Not only do we talk about it, but we also have KPIs. We have AED100 million (USD27.2 million) to be spent in three years, so we need to measure our performance and our impact. The fund is administered by the AGFE; this is another way in which we differ from most traditional charities and philanthropic entities who are not completely transparent. These organizations need to be professionally run by a full, dedicated team. AGFE, with its 18 team members, does not deliver any of the services; we use our partners to do this. For example, for our refugee camps we put the criteria in place and select and monitor the partners. We do not deliver services because there are better people who can deliver education to refugees better than we could. We do not want to be a high school or a university. My message to our business community here is that they should come out and set up more professionalized charity work and work for impact. They should set up their KPIs, talk about their progress, and encourage other people. This also serves to encourage people not to duplicate work as well facilitate knowledge transfer. While I do not want people to duplicate our activities, they can learn from us and apply it to their own initiatives. We can save them all that hard work and research we have done over the last three years about how to bring education to refugees in a cost-effective and innovative way with an impact on the ground. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What recent economic and market trends have you noticed in Dubai, and how have these changes influenced the way Amanat Holding has been investing?<br></strong>We continue to see opportunity in our chosen investment sectors, healthcare and education, which are set to benefit from sustained growth across the Middle East. 2019 was characterized by continued government investment in core defensive sectors as well as rising demand for specialized healthcare and first-rate education. We expect to see these trends continue into 2020. In education, the government has put a knowledge-based economy at the heart of its vision; this is supported by positive socioeconomic dynamics, such as a growing population and improving affluence, which both drive enrolments. In healthcare, we see a growing demand for specialist healthcare to support the rising incidence of chronic lifestyle diseases including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Government spending on health care in the GCC is expected to rise to USD30.5 billion by 2021 to support these patients. Our vision is to deliver value to our shareholders while helping to improve the quality of healthcare and education across the region in line with government ambitions.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest challenges investors are facing in the Dubai market?<br></strong>Volatility in oil prices since mid-2014 and its ensuing effect on the economy has impacted Dubai's main bourse index and liquidity in the UAE's stock markets, which are still seeing much lower traded volumes. Additionally, rising interest rates in the UAE have also affected investor costs when it comes to accessing funds. That being said, the government is addressing these challenges through multiple initiatives, including the latest approval for the largest federal budget in the country's history of AED66.4 billion for the fiscal year of 2020, an increase of 10.1% from 2019's AED60.3 billion budget. In addition, 2020 is going to be an exciting year as Dubai continues on its journey to Expo. The event will stimulate the development of innovative businesses in the UAE and enhance the country's international reputation as the preferred location to do business. Therefore, whilst there are challenges, there are a number of interesting opportunities from a macro-level.</p><p><strong>Amanat Holding specializes in investments around health and education. Why did you select these specific sectors, and how are these sectors evolving in Dubai?</strong><br>We focus on core defensive sectors that are set to benefit from sustained growth across the Middle East. Our distinct investment platforms are designed to build long-term value for shareholders. We do this by providing access to healthcare and education investments in MENA that are set to benefit from long-term growth catalysts. On a practical level, our team benefits from a wealth of expertise in our chosen sectors of healthcare and education. We aim to leverage these strengths to empower our portfolio companies to create long-term sustainable returns and a lasting legacy. The challenge for both the healthcare and education sectors is to continually enhance and adapt their offerings in an ever-more demanding environment, underpinned by technological advances and growing demographic pressures. This challenge is an opportunity to add significant value and support continual improvement. Amanat has the potential to become a game changer in healthcare and education, not only in the UAE but at an international level as well. </p><p><strong>What are your main goals and objectives for 2020?<br></strong>Amanat's strategy is to invest in attractive healthcare and education opportunities across MENA and in other regions as well. To date, our portfolio has primarily been focused on the top two regional economies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE. We recently expanded our geographic footprint to Bahrain, where we acquired a leading healthcare asset. In 2020, we have plans to expand our footprint to take advantage of opportunities, both close to home in the UAE and beyond the Gulf. Looking ahead, Amanat will continue to invest in businesses that are distinctive, differentiated, and competitively sustainable, where we can build long-term value. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been the company's role in enabling the shift toward investing in people as assets?<br></strong>As a company, we do not entertain assignments just for the sake of it. Many times, we have declined sessions because we determined the client's need was different from the service we offer. This has strengthened our relationship with companies and helped us maintain our client-centric focus. Our main accounts back in the 1960s used to be in oil and gas; we were the partners they could rely on. Building this client base over the decades, we have seen how people have developed in recent years. Many participants who attended Meirc's courses years ago are now in senior positions.</p><p><strong>Expanding on the oil and gas sector, how is the diversifying economy changing your portfolio of clients?<br></strong>We have a diversified client base. Our main industries are energy, financial services, government, health, industrial, oil and gas, real estate, services, and telecoms. We have grown from mainly oil and gas in the 1960s to all other sectors as we have seen more demand for our services in many areas. Particularly, we are seeing demand in Saudi Arabia because of the transformation happening and we are working with several ministries. In geographical terms, outside the Middle East, we are active in Africa and Southeast Asia. The only real barrier to where we work is dangerous political situations. We will not operate in any country where there is a risk for our personnel as the safety of our consultants is of the greatest importance.</p><p><strong>With the pace of change accelerating and the transformation toward a knowledge-based economy, what does innovation look like at Meirc?</strong><br>Coming to Dubai was a great thing for Meirc because it pushed us to innovate. When I started with the company in the 1990s, we had a limited number of accounts that we grew organically. We later began venturing into areas outside of our expertise and expanding our offerings. For this, we had to attract the right talent ourselves. Because we are selective in our talent onboarding, we have a low turnover. We also recently ventured into technical hands-on training and expanded our offering by introducing specialized exam preparation courses for globally recognized finance and accounting professional qualifications like certified management accountant and certified public accountant. Additionally, we will soon start our online training programs. We already have the infrastructure built, and with this, the whole world will become our market. The fee structure will be slightly different, but we will reach everyone around the globe. In Meirc, we ask our trainers to continuously improve their knowledge by attending trainings as well to help us stay on top of trends and be proactive. We walk the talk.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for Meirc for 2020?<br></strong>Our slogan can be summed up as sustainable growth. Innovation is not without its risks, but we are taking calculated risks to ensure sustainable growth. Over the last 60 years, Meirc has never reduced its headcounts when the economy went down. We have seen many cycles. The last one was a few years ago, and we did not reduce our salaries or let anyone go. We believe in innovation; we push the envelope to stay at the top. We will not sit on our laurels and take it easy since we believe every day is a chance for improvement. Quality is the number-one area for improvement along with staff satisfaction. No improvement is made at the expense of staff satisfaction. We cannot afford to have anyone demotivated because a demotivated person will ruin the infrastructure. As more and more people realize the value in their human talent, we remain at the top of the game to provide enhanced quality and services to our clients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does the integration of DKP and DIAC respond to labor market needs?<br></strong>DKP and DIAC were established with an effort by Dubai to create knowledge-based economic clusters. TECOM Group turned this vision into action by taking charge of different industries and sectors. The group started with Dubai Internet City in 1999, followed by Dubai Media City a year later. These sector-focused cities were created to address local challenges, such as a lack of regional talent and human resources. The initial reason behind establishing DKP was to respond and cater to the requirements of the workforce. When local, regional, and international companies set up in Dubai, their human resources requirements must be met. Companies used to bring staff from other countries. Attracting companies in HR development was important, which is how DKP was created; we are the only HR zone in the world. In total, there are more than 95,000 people working across TECOM Group's 10 sector-focused communities. This would not have been possible without the creation of specialized parks with business-friendly regulations and interconnected infrastructure. When DKP was created in 2003, it was not just for HR and training, but also for higher education. After DKP started to attract universities, with the interest from institutions came the idea of a higher education zone. DIAC was thus created in 2007 and currently has 27 institutions from at least nine countries offering more than 500 programs. We have more than 27,000 students of 150 nationalities studying at these academic institutions, and we are still attracting new institutions, students and investment.</p><p><strong>What are DKP and DIAC's expansion and partnership plans?<br></strong>We need to understand size and demand. The market can accommodate expansion even though we focus on quality, not quantity. We are always working hard to forge partnerships with global institutions and convey the advantages of being here. With other countries putting in restrictions rather than easing movement, there is an opportunity for us to seize. Education is an important component in attracting tourism. Our market research study showed that there major upcoming destinations, such as Indonesia, Nigeria, and Chile, want to build on these trends and utilize them. We work equally as hard to attract institutions as we do students. One important consideration for international students studying abroad is student accommodation, which was a challenge for many years. We identified this gap and opened the first student accommodation in DIAC in October 2019. In Dubai and the UAE, the value chain begins with regulations. We continuously work to ease our regulations for institutions coming here. For example, Dubai Development Authority launched Earn While You Learn, which allows those on a student visa to work in TECOM Group companies. Next to DIAC is Dubai Outsource City, and companies there want students who can work a few hours a day or week. It is all about building something that will work and is sustainable. All these aspects are important; it is not just a matter of building buildings and telling institutions to come. </p><p><strong>What are the priorities moving forward for DKP and DIAC?<br></strong>One priority is to attract more students to Dubai and contribute to the UAE's knowledge economy by creating a first-rate education system. In line with this commitment, we established the Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation in Dubai Design District to develop a new generation of students that merge visual literacy with digital fluency and strategic acumen. We also want to discuss solar energy with universities and contribute to Dubai's vision to become a hub for clean energy and green technology. Moreover, we want to attract universities to develop new programs and students. One of the most important aspects we are developing relates to vocational education. We have been speaking with vocational institutes from around the world to advance our offering and enable the UAE to set new benchmarks in learning and knowledge. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the company's greatest achievements in Colombia?<br></strong>Veolia has been in Colombia since the 1990s, focused on the issue of water, waste, and, more recently, energy efficiency. In water, we are a respected name; we are participating in large concessions in Tunja and Monteria where we have been serving for more than 20 years. We have extended the Tunja contract until 2026, and will maybe extend it further, until 2034. Previously, Tunja did not have complete coverage and suffered from lack of continuous service and operational problems. Today, with the same infrastructure, it has coverage 24 hours a day, water of the highest quality, and an excellent uncounted water ratio of 16%. In Colombia, this number is usually 36%. We have been innovating with technology, waste collection, and disposal. We have 11 environmental parks where we manage the disposal of solid waste. Hubgrade, a registered trademark of Veolia, is for energy efficiency issues, specifically for monitoring and control, so that our customers can reduce their CO2 footprint. We have a large global network through the company. On a global level, Veolia is increasingly oriented toward the industrial sector. In Colombia, our client base is composed of 70% municipal clients and 30% industrial clients.</p><p><strong>Veolia has been focusing on becoming a responsible company committed to the future of Colombia. How does this translate to your focus on the future?</strong><br>Veolia's rationale is to contribute to human development through a series of environmental strategies and policies to maintain resources and have better access to them. We are focused on circular economies from the point of view of sustainability. For example, for plastics, we have global agreements with companies like Nestlé, so that in five years, the plastic they produce can be recycled. With energy, we try to produce it with our waste.</p><p><strong>Veolia renewed an agreement with the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI). How does your private approach relate to this agreement?</strong><br>We want a better environmental education, so this agreement's objective is to manage a program that caters to children of low and medium resources in the seven countries where we are present. With the program and through their artistic expressions, they can imagine a way to transform the world into a better place. Some 35,000 children in Latin America have participated.</p><p><strong>What is Veolia's relationship with the oil and gas sector, and how will you continue to serve this sector?<br></strong>This sector is vital to us since it has to do with our commitment to encouraging circular economies, in terms of environmental protection and upstream and downstream management. We are working hard in this sector with Ecopetrol. We are growing gradually in the refinery space.</p><p><strong>Veolia wants to eliminate the emission of 6.6 billion kg of CO2 annually. What are other achievements planned for 2020 and beyond?</strong><br>In two of our environmental parks, we are already working to reduce CO2 emissions. This CO2 emission reduction management is audited, which allows us to have resources for the sale of carbon bonds later. We are reducing CO2 emissions when we use energy efficiently or when we use waste to produce energy. We are taking these actions in hospitals, shopping centers, and large buildings. Another goal is to increase our portfolio of industrial clients. To help with this, we will use the hubgrade system to create better and smarter ways of managing energy, water, and waste. In water management, Colombia is doing well. As large cities already have efficient operators, we want to focus on medium-sized cities that do not have the same capabilities as Bogotá or Medellí­n. Regarding energy efficiency, we are working with Coca-Cola Femsa in Barranquilla on the construction of a turbine that will generate cold, heat, and energy for the Barranquilla heat plant. This is a great template of what we want to pursue in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What aspects of the country's economy has stood out since J.P. Morgan arrived in Colombia?<br></strong>J.P. Morgan has been operating in Colombia since 1964 and expanded its presence in the country in 2006 with the opening of J.P. Morgan Corporacion Financiera, a subsidiary. The bank has been growing alongside our Colombian clients using its first-class global platform and expertise and pairing it with a strong local presence. We are especially proud of the work helping institutional investors and large corporate clients expand and diversify. J.P. Morgan's role in expanding Colombia's access to global capital markets has been extremely relevant. In 2014, Colombia was included in J.P. Morgan's Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets (GBI-EM), effectively bringing foreign capital into the country. Today, institutional investors like pension funds or wealth manager funds globally have a positive perception and knowledge of Colombia that did not exist a decade ago.</p><p><strong>What efforts has J.P. Morgan made to improve practices in the market?<br></strong>In the capital markets, we have been working closely with the government to improve practices and standardize derivatives, which is crucial for Colombia to compete with other emerging markets. We also see plenty of opportunities to keep growing the local stock market. Regarding debt capital markets, Colombia is a benchmark in Latin America due to its depth, turnover, liquidity, and commitment of participants. J.P. Morgan has been active in the creation of an interest rate market critical for companies, as it helps them hedge risks and strengthens their balance sheets. J.P. Morgan is now able to offer clients in Colombia hedges for up to 20 years in different rates.<br>	<br><strong>What benefits will an investor identify in Colombia to invest here?<br></strong>Colombia has strong institutions and incredible potential. Regardless of economic or political cycles, investors have seen over the years that they can rely on Colombia. The country learnt from the crisis at the end of the 1990s that it needed to implement significant changes to the financial system, and today banks and financial institutions have become one of the country's biggest strengths. All the relevant political parties in the political spectrum are equally committed to macro stability and institutionalism. Colombia is also a much more open country than others in the region. We are an attractive market for businesses, with a young and growing population of 50 million and a rapidly growing middle class. </p><p><strong>What positive consequences could this growth bring, and how does this relate to J.P. Morgan's commitment to Colombia?<br></strong>We need to continue to invest in innovation if we want to keep helping the country and our clients grow. Infrastructure is a sector that will drive economic expansion. J.P. Morgan plans to continue working closely with the government and private corporations in this area. J.P. Morgan is also extremely committed to the communities where we have a presence. We are trying to improve standards in terms of diversity, social responsibility, and philanthropy, directly funding projects and offering J.P. Morgan's expertise. We do encourage our employees to use working hours to volunteer for these initiatives. In Colombia, for example, we have been working with a group of women called Women in Connection to improve gender equality in the country. We use the visibility of powerful women to improve corporate practices, align public policies, and bring in men as allies, among other initiatives. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has technology disrupted the education sector in Dubai?<br></strong>Education is still provided today by teachers; however, the disruption by technology has already started. Students today will not only rely on the time they have in a classroom to learn; they will be learning all the time and connecting with each other more and more. Students will be pushing the sector forward and pushing for the integration of technology. Technology and AI will not only make education better in terms of volume of information and personalization of information, but will also make learning more fun and engaging. AI can be used as a personalized teaching tool at scale, which will change the purpose of a teacher's traditional role in future. The idea of school being brick-and-mortar is changing. School may not continue to be a full-time job for students. As our world continues to change faster and faster, micro credentials and digital badging will also have an impact on how we view and value traditional qualifications</p><p><strong>Are we moving toward a more holistic approach to education?<br></strong>It always helps to go back to the purpose. The word for education in Latin is "educere," and one of the definitions is "to bring out from within." This is the purpose of education. It challenges the more recent notion that education is about 'putting in' rather than 'bringing out.' With the help of technology and AI, education is becoming more personalized; it is becoming more about what individual students do well. Change that took 20 years to happen is now taking just a few years. It is not just the speed of change, but the type of change is different as well. This kind of change will be good for education. Education will focus more on well-being, and social and emotional learning. People today are filled with stress and anxiety. Education is a way to overcome these problems. Education will not just help people to survive, but to thrive as well.</p><p><strong>Which areas of Dubai's education need the most focus from the government?<br></strong>Early education needs the most focus. Looking at the numbers, we can see that many newcomers to Dubai are younger families. Parents are more aware today of the value of educating kids at an early age. New research emphasizes the importance of early learning, so this is where we need to invest; this is where the highest returns will come from. </p><p><strong>The University of Birmingham and the Rochester Institute of Technology have recently opened campuses here. How important is it for Dubai to attract more international schools?</strong><br>It is important. We need to increase the footprint of segments that have traditionally brought in tourists, but also need to look at other segments, like healthcare, education, and sports tourism.  Higher education is different from schooling, because schooling is determined by the number of people physically living here. With higher education, you are not confined to people living in Dubai. Once people reach the age of higher education, they may go abroad. We see enrolment rates increasing more rapidly in higher education than in lower school education. Dubai has experienced growth in the number of international branch campuses, particularly in the past 15 years. This is largely because Dubai fills a gap in the market. The US, UK, and Australia are typical destinations for higher education, but may be out of reach for many young people. The Arab Youth Survey recently revealed that Dubai is considered as the destination of choice for higher education among Arab youth throughout the Middle East. If we add Dubai's vibrant economy and job landscape to the mix, it is easy to see why Dubai is becoming a more attractive choice for higher education. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Our employee training always emphasizes the importance of excellent guest relations. We have a rating of 9.1 out of 10 for our staff in most of the OTAs and online platforms. In addition, blending contemporary amenities in elegant rooms and suites with personalized services ensures guests have a truly welcoming and relaxing retreat every time. All rooms are equipped with GRMS systems, 40-inch smart TVs, media hub, complimentary high-speed internet, and classy amenities.</p><p><strong>What impacts do you foresee in Dubai's hospitality industry and economy more broadly?  <br></strong>Dubai is a well-established tourist destination in the global tourism map. Expo 2020 will give Dubai a more prominent place and ranking in other sectors of economy and will open doors to entrepreneurs attracted to the country. The hospitality industry will benefit from the rise in demand that Expo 2020 will create. The expo will also contribute more to the midscale hotels like the Golden Tulip. We also would like to thank the Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) for their initiatives to attract more tourists to the country. Year on year, Dubai airport saw an increased number of passengers, with its flexible visa options as another advantage attracting more visitors to the country.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and vision for 2020 and the coming years?<br></strong>Our priority for 2020 is to make the hotel more established in the market, while working on the demand created by Expo 2020. We are working with select markets that fit our hotel. We are also aiming to strengthen our market presence in emerging markets to capitalize on the increased demand from these. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did Ramada start its operations in Dubai and how has the company developed since?<br></strong>Ramada Chelsea Hotel started its operations in May 2010. At the time, we were the fifth hotel in the Al Barsha region, though there are now more than 90. Competition here is extremely intense; there are approximately 8,000 to 9,000 rooms available to tourists within a several-kilometer radius. The unique selling point for all of these is their proximity to the Mall of the Emirates, and they all capitalize on this point. This hotel has five restaurants and bars and presents its guests with unique choices regarding rooms. We cater to different tastes in order to make each guest feel at home. Inside the hotel, we offer five main cuisines to cater to the main demographics of our guests, who mainly come from China, the US, the UK, Europe, and the Arab world. The government of Dubai has also opened up its visa policy to cater to more nationalities by offering visas on arrival, which has opened new markets for us. We have had nearly nine years of successful operations at the hotel. We thank all our guests for their patronage and are grateful for the various awards we have received based on guest satisfaction.</p><p><strong>How do you optimize costs and make sure your operations are progressing in the most efficient way?<br></strong>We place great emphasis on effective cost management and making sure all our resources are put to the best possible use. We are meticulous when it comes to cost control. We are also mindful of expiry dates and the shelf lives of everything we use, and we are extremely serious about preventing losses. We make tractability reports, specifying when raw materials are received, when the food is cooked, when it is shelved, and how much of it is sold. Every six months, we do a popularity analysis on the menus; if an item's popularity is below 20-30%, that item will be dropped from the menu. We also have a suggestion card given to guests after they finish their meals to receive more feedback about their dining experience with us.</p><p><strong>What are your goals and objectives for the Ramada Al Barsha in 2019?<br></strong>Since 2016, our occupancy rate has been steadily increasing. In 2017, the occupancy rate grew by almost 4%, and although 2018 was a challenging year, we still aim for 4% growth. 2019 was even more challenging. The supply of hospitality services increases every day in Dubai, and we have to stay competitive and make sure we stand out. We sit down with our sales team three to four times a week to look at our gains from our strategies and see what changes need to be made. We never implement a strategy and wait for a month to see what happens; we monitor the developments closely, and this sets us apart. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Currently, around 76% of travelers are millennials, and as we represent this market, we keep close tabs on millennials' needs and expectations. This can be seen in all aspects of our business, from the hotel's strategic location in Barsha, close to offices and universities, to our minimalistic design, our staff's friendly approach and casually designed uniforms, and the various second generation-catered philosophies of our F&amp;B outlets. One of our strategies to stay relevant that sets us apart from similar properties is that we hire young. Young staff members bring about fresh ideas, passions, and motivation that only add more value to our brand offering.</p><p><strong>How do you anticipate Expo 2020 impacting both tourism and the overall economy? <br></strong>We are watching the developments of Expo 2020 closely. We seek to ensure that we position ourselves correctly in order to attract our share of the 25 million expected visitors. We are working to become one of the official hotel partners of the Expo, though this is not yet an official designation. The tourism and hospitality sector is looking forward to Expo 2020 by announcing more projects to meet the rising demands of tourist inflow; but this means that with an increase of demand, comes an increase in the supply of hotels, keeping the industry as competitive as ever.</p><p><strong>What else is in the Dusit pipeline? <br></strong>For a while, dusitD2 was considered to be an art hub for many artists, and we are working to revive this status. We hosted an art week in October, dedicated to reactivating the art community in Dubai and going back to our roots of being an art-focused hotel. As part of this interactive week, we organized multiple workshops, hosted major artists who painted live at the property, as well as dedicated a day for kids to get in touch with their artistic side and give talented, young individuals the opportunity to display their skills and learn more. We also plan to expand into the UK. We are hopeful that Europe will be our next big destination. </p><p><strong>Have you noticed a shift in the composition of tourists to Dubai? <br></strong>When I first arrived in Dubai in late 2002, 70% of tourists were from specific European countries. Today, Dubai's popularity as a tourist destination is only set to grow in the coming years with its year-round calendar of festivals, events, shopping experiences, and the city's rapid expansion. Dubai is no longer just a beach or luxury mall destination; it is a talent magnet. Now, a visitor can engage in new and diverse activities with the innovative tools and skill building opportunities that Dubai has to offer, such as Dubai Creative Zone, which provides the perfect entrepreneurial-spirited environment for tech innovators and startups. A great deal of focus of Dubai's tourism and destination management is now on Asian markets, which represent a large portion of all global tourism. China would be the number-one source, with Japan and South Korea following. The GCC also represents a great deal of travelers, and we are the regional hub for short- to medium-term trips for travelers around the GCC. Our properties also focus on attracting travelers from CIS countries, Eastern Europe, and Scandinavia. In addition to millennial business travelers, our target audience comes to Dubai to be culturally educated, inspired, and enriched by discovering new regions and learning new things. Many major universities around the world have opened campuses in Dubai, and this attracts numerous millennials who end up staying with us on a long-term basis; they are the marginal percentage of our overall occupants. </p>]]></richbody0content>

The participants are licensed and have workshops and receive advice from a board of investors that invests in interesting prototypes and projects. We also have a business center, co-working space, and micro studios for those who want to start and test the market before going commercial. If you are a start-up designer without the capital to lease a d3 office space, we offer alternatives like a freelance visa under the d3 umbrella. We also have the business expertise to help guide people to test the waters before fully investing in a commercial space. We also offer workshops that to allow them to grow into a commercial space. d3 is also partnered with Dubai SME, which has a large number of local entrepreneurs. The d3 structure allows for us to have mainland license and a free zone structure as well as a dual custom code.</p><p><strong>As a unique design hub in the region, how do you work with the government and larger businesses to create a well-rounded environment?</strong><br>First, we are looking to improve the government agenda in terms of attention to the design sector. We want d3 to cater to the headquarters of design, art, and luxury brands. At present, 80% of our portfolio comprises international companies. A few government entities also have offices here, like the Ministry of Culture, Dubai Culture, and Dubai Schools Council. We have names such as Dior, Chanel, Hugo Boss, Foster &amp; Partners, and Zaha Hadid. We have the offices and regional headquarters for Lego, Asics, Adidas, and Puma. We want to leverage our existing brands and attract FDI to Dubai's design industry. Some of our existing business partners have initiatives with the government, and they are bringing in talent from Europe for these projects. This is where we are seeing a soft contribution coming back to the design industry and Dubai. There are a lot of successful emerging designers, and d3 has been able to provide the platform for them to shine. In addition to offering a commercial space and platform, we also sponsor events which are relevant to the industry, like Fashion Forward and Design Week.</p><p><strong>From which regions are you seeing people come to d3, and from which markets are you looking to attract entrepreneurs and companies?</strong><br>Our focus is mainly Europe and Asia. Looking at regional stability, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have the most to offer, but in terms of the design sector itself, the UAE has a bigger pull, especially from Egypt. Our location and logistics advantages attract people to explore the Middle East market. Within Europe and Asia, we have defined primary and secondary markets. In Asia, the primary market is China, which is a must for us to penetrate as we see huge potential in the design sector there. Within Europe, the UK, Germany, Italy, and France are our primary focuses. This is not to only position the luxury or big brands but also medium-sized companies who want to work through Dubai. We are also eyeing opportunities that coincide with our business missions, travels, and exhibitions.<br>What are your priorities for 2020 to make d3 synonymous with the region's creative ecosystem?<br>We are currently eyeing Expo 2020 and are working closely with the Expo team. This is where we would like to put some of our business partners, curations, and projects. In 2018, Expo wanted our help to design the uniform, and we did a competition across the entire UAE. Several d3 businesses took part. We collaborated on a few projects and continue to work with them and plan more collaborations. We have also spoken with their international department to receive their delegates within d3 to do their programming. Expo 2020 will be a great tool and fantastic opportunity for showcasing and exposing designers, especially considering the caliber of visitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the luxury segment in Dubai?<br></strong>Dubai focused on bringing luxury offerings to the local and international market early on. This started with the airport; Dubai Airport and the airlines that fly through it have been essential in attracting luxury visitors and creating a luxury experience. The country has done a great job at developing a clear luxury-oriented strategy. However, the government's strategy, not to mention our own, has been more than just a focus on the luxury segment. We want to delight people in numerous ways. This means creating an entire experience that is luxurious and delight-inducing from beginning to end. The vision in Dubai is about positioning the nation to offer luxurious, value-added propositions. There are now more brands here than in London or Hong Kong. There has been a heavy emphasis put on developing assets like shopping malls that can cater to the luxury-oriented visitors. As a retailer, we are experiencing the same phenomenon. We are also focused on utilizing technology to offer a different experience. Digital competition is becoming difficult, and the digital retail landscape is forcing us to offer new and unique products and focus on innovative approaches.</p><p><strong>What is special about the beauty market in the Middle East?<br></strong>The luxury market has been quite flat in the Middle East over recent years. The Middle Eastern market is worth EUR8 billion, compared to EUR300 billion for the global market. In general, the Middle East has been a fragrance-oriented market. Previously, fragrances made up 60% of the luxury market, where makeup and skincare made up 30% and 10%, respectively. At present, fragrance represents barely 50% of the market, makeup has increased to over 40%, and skincare is still hovering around 10%. Asia is mainly a skincare market, while Europe is fairly balanced, and fragrance is smaller in America. We are moving to a market that is more interested in how it looks, and it will evolve into a market that is more and more interested in skincare. In 12 years, we went from bringing the first Sephora shop to the UAE to the point where every mall wants to have one.</p><p><strong>As an expert in luxury retail, what does Faces mean to the Chalhoub Group?<br></strong>We have been strongly integrated in the beauty world in the Middle East. Faces has been the concept that helps us move away from being a brand distributor to a presenter of brands, to best express brands to our customers. We are now more engaged with our customers. We are continuously evolving as the market evolves, and the market demands a more unique, bespoke experience. It is about offering different experiences and services for a real customer journey, making him or her feel and look good. We did this for two main reasons: our customers and competition have completely changed and transformed in the last 20-30 years. Second is a shift in the economy that forces players to either leave the market or reposition themselves. Pursuing the latter is a bigger investment and riskier, though that is significantly much more rewarding.</p><p><strong>What do you want customers to remember and convey to others?<br></strong>For most, the experience starts when customers enter the store and ends when they leave. For us, through building several omni-channel tools, we aim at the experience before the store and continue way after. Customers will receive an email after going to the store, and they can tell us what they liked or what they did not like. We want friends and family to view us as a place that welcomes, understands, and respects them. We are here to help people live their beauty and individuality. That is, quintessentially, the story behind the rebranding of Faces: feel good, look good, connect, engage, and feel at home. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes the Montegrappa brand unique?<br></strong>Montegrappa was founded in 1912 in a part of Italy traditionally well-known for metal, silver, and goldsmith work. Just before World War I, the refillable fountain pen was a crucial means of communication, and during the war, the company found itself on the frontline of the fighting. The Montegrappa building was one of the few that remained a pen factory; most of the other buildings in the area were converted into ammunition factories to support the war. The company survived the war, and its building remains almost unchanged to this day. What is great about Montegrappa is that there is a genuine history around the brand; it has been in the same building for 108 years and is one of the region's historic traditions of craftsmanship.</p><p><strong>How has the making of the pen evolved over time?<br></strong>In the early days, the company made gold and silver pens because people just wanted a good quality refillable fountain pen for function. As the brand evolved, it started making increasingly exclusive, high-priced, limited-edition products. One example is its famous dragon pen, of which only 1,912 were produced to celebrate the company's founding. These sorts of limited productions created an increased demand for exclusive items, changing the luxury industry. In the luxury business today, consumers want their own, personalized objects that no one else has. Our talented craftsmen and others who work in our factory and design studio can create a piece of art on a pen in silver or gold, which plays nicely into customers' demands.</p><p><strong>How has technology influenced this niche segment?<br></strong>There is a great similarity between pens and watches. The Swiss watch industry was an industry that lasted for hundreds of years. When quartz watches appeared in the 1960s, this beautiful industry suddenly became obsolete. Thankfully, people recognized the beauty of the craftsmanship involved and wanted to preserve it, as it is such an important representation of a human achievement. Today, there is a flourishing industry in fine watchmaking, supported by watch collectors and aficionados, beyond the hedonistic pursuit of creating beautiful items, that is preserving a crucial part of human history and creativity. Pens have a similar story. The pen changed society and civilization forever. The pen represents knowledge being passed on and transferred from generation to generation. While we may not need a Swiss watch to tell us the time today, or an expensive pen to write notes, these fine accessories are incredibly important symbols, and it is only fitting that these should be highly valued and treasured items. It is also about the aesthetic and tactility, as one's brain is physically connected through their arm and the paper they write on. More recently, it has been discovered that hand writing is important for brain health and delaying the onset of degenerative brain conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's. We are seeing a significant increase in the demand for fountain pens, with a movement toward retro and vintage. </p><p><strong>How does the brand fit within the Dubai market, and how do you foresee it evolving in coming years?<br></strong>The demand for customized products in the region is not just at the individual level. The brand has developed some collections to celebrate local historic and cultural events. In 2011, Montegrappa produced a 40-year national day pen and, more recently, a pen dedicated to the UAE's national anthem, with the words of the national anthem inscribed around its barrel. In terms of demand, a peculiarity of the UAE market is Arab hospitality; as a result, there is a culture of gifting. People still gift high-value items to a great extent, so people are not always buying for themselves. Other regions have cultures of giving as well, though in Dubai and the GCC the price point of gifts might be higher. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>As the effective welcome and farewell committee to nearly every visitor to Dubai, how do you manage this task, and how does your approach align with Dubai's brand?<br></strong>From the beginning, DDF has always had the dual mission of promoting the Dubai brand and the DDF brand. We are delighted to have established our brand identity from the early days, and DDF is now synonymous with quality, choice, service, ambience, and value. We currently operate around 40,000 sqm of retail space at Dubai International Airport and Al Maktoum International Airport and employ almost 6,100 staff, who, I believe, are the best trained staff in the world, serving almost 90 million passengers in 2019. We have been, and continue to be, committed to investing in a wide-reaching marketing campaign that is aimed ultimately at “Turning Flyers into Buyers." In 2019, as the operation celebrated its 36th anniversary, 2.5% of its turnover was dedicated to its marketing campaign. And over the past year, DDF has continued to invest in a communication strategy that covers event management, sports sponsorship, industry sponsorship, advertising, public relations, media relations, promotions, and community projects that give DDF and Dubai the exposure that puts us on the map.</p><p><strong>How is DDF looking to expand collaborations beyond the airport?<br></strong>While the successful running of the shop floor is our major focus, we also promote Dubai to a global audience and, along with many other entities, aim to retain Dubai's reputation as a leading business, leisure, and sporting capital. In terms of sports sponsorship, one of the highlights was the DDF Tennis Championships, which has been running for 28 years and is owned and organized by DDF. Media analysis show that the two-week tournament generated an estimated USD1.3 billion worth of TV exposure for Dubai, of which USD445 million is for the DDF brand alone. We also support international horseracing events and paid two visits this year to Newbury Racecourse in the UK in April and September, as well as Ascot for the DDF Shergar Cup in August. June also saw the 12th DDF Irish Derby, which was held at the newly renovated Curragh Racecourse in Ireland. In addition, in Ireland, we attended the fifth DDF Irish Open, which was held at Lahinch Golf Club in County Clare in 2019.</p><p><strong>How does DDF continuously surpass expectations to create meaningful retail experiences, and how do you anticipate retail to evolve in Dubai?</strong><br>As a leading retailer in Dubai, we have consistently looked at ways to improve our retail offerings to an increasingly diverse passenger mix. We have collaborated more with our suppliers and partners to ensure we deliver the right products at the right prices in the right location. This combined with a series of strategic promotions, both in the physical stores and online, has seen an increase in sales in core categories. Also, with the increased presence of e-commerce, our customers value individual service and staff with in-depth product knowledge who are able to make recommendations based on their requirements and communicate with them in their language. This is especially important for younger travelers who expect convenience and an individual experience. This includes an expectation to offer a fast and convenient check out experience, and we now offer a wide choice of payment options including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and AliPay. As our customers are constantly connected and thus comparing prices and product availability, we are conscious of offering great value and a wide selection of merchandise and relevant brands. DDF also launched a major digital marketing initiative in 2019 as part of its 'Road to USD3 billion' vision. This initiative saw us invest in both people and technology to increase digital reach and improve our customer engagement and service, connecting with the airports' nearly 90 million passengers in a more effective and personalized way. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What have been the key drivers for the establishment of The Priory Group in Dubai, and how do your key services fit within the context of the UAE's health system?<br></strong>As the largest independent provider of mental health services in the UK, we attract many service users worldwide. It was a natural progression for us to look at how we could grow internationally. We chose the UAE because of the ease of establishing a business, its excellent location to serve and support our service users across the GCC, and the dynamic nature of operating here. Our research showed a gap in the provision that we could address. Mental health services are an integral part of any healthcare system, and this is no different in the UAE. We see a fantastic proactive approach from the UAE government toward mental health. In 2018, Dubai launched Happy Lives are Healthy Lives, its first mental health strategy. In November 2018, it was announced that Dubai's mandatory health insurance would cover mental healthcare. The government actively wants to do something about the increase in mental health issues. Additionally, we have engaged with the Emirate's health authorities to talk about mental health. There is a real appetite to implement Dubai's first mental health strategy.</p><p><strong>How can social media affect mental health?<br></strong>Social media can lead to living a virtual life, with limited face-to-face interaction, avoidance, and often misconstrued reality. This may lead to mental health-related issues such as depression, loss of individual value, low confidence, and anxiety. An interesting study on mirror neurons, which help us understand emotions and behaviors, suggests that, with an increased online presence, our mirror neurons are not developing as they should. It is essential to have a balance between time spent online and socially interacting in-person. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What is the overall contribution of Mediclinic Middle East to the company's operations?<br></strong>We have 54 hospitals in southern Africa, 18 in Switzerland, and own a 30% stake in Spire Healthcare in the UK with 39 hospitals. Meanwhile we have seven hospitals and 20 clinics in the Middle East. We contribute around 26% to Mediclinic's revenue worldwide. We are the third or fourth largest in terms of market share.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of sector-related policies in Dubai?<br></strong>Looking at the past 14 years, which is how long we have been in the UAE, regulations have certainly improved and ensured that the healthcare environment has more control. More regulations have come into effect, such as the introduction of mandatory health insurance, and a more ethical market has taken shape. In 2019, the government also created the Dubai Health Post Office, which is a portal through which all our payments are processed. It has created the e-Prescription initiative, where all pharmacies seek approval, payments are processed, and e-authorization for healthcare services is obtained. Abu Dhabi has a new Department of Health, which has a healthcare advisory board that I sit on. The plan is to eventually have one national unified medical record, which will be fantastic.</p><p><strong>In that mid- to upper market, has there been a shift toward preventative care?<br></strong>That seems to be a more observable trend globally; almost half of healthcare expenditure goes to preventative health and wellness. Executive medicals are a large business line, and people are trying their best today to stay healthy and out of surgery. In our business, we do executive medicals and are starting a precision medical laboratory where you take the gene sequencing of an individual and give them specific medication based on what their genes indicate a shortage of. The next step is called microbiome, where bacteria in your stomach are looked at to determine what is missing so that you do not need antibiotics. This can tell you specifically which bacteria are required to ensure you maintain a healthy lifestyle. </p><p><strong>What are your priorities for the next two years?<br></strong>First, it is important to note that the economic environment of the UAE is under strain. The economy has certainly changed over the past three to four years, as has the mix of the people in the UAE. The reality is that Dubai has already diversified, and Abu Dhabi will diversify still further. There are big attractions to bringing in major manufacturing companies and huge incentives in place. The UAE has become a country where receivables are on the rise. We have obviously been here for a long time; we are positioned in a certain way, have a strong balance sheet, and are listed on the London Stock Exchange. While we are not committing to major new investments currently, we do have a significant number already being worked on. The first one is Mediclinic ParkView Hospital, which we finished in September 2018 and is doing well. We opened it because we felt we needed a hospital nearer to the Expo 2020. Our other major project is Mediclinic Airport Road Hospital in Abu Dhabi, which is under expansion to double in size. The new extension should open early 2020. These two projects alone, Parkview and Airport Road, have added 40% capacity to our business over the past two years. We do expect some consolidation in the industry due to regulatory changes and prevailing economic conditions. We are well-positioned to embrace this. We bought the Majid Al Futtaim clinics last year and Bourn Hall, the original pioneers of IVF over 40 years ago. They invented that technology and are present in the UAE under a franchise arrangement. We are focusing more on and moving our business toward preventative and precision medicine. That will be a key focus for us over the coming years, as well as embracing other innovations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Novartis is a company on the forefront of global research. What key initiatives is it driving in the region, and how you are looking to take the industry to the next level?<br></strong>UAE is a hub for innovation, which really ties in with Novartis' mission to reimagine medicine to improve and prolong peoples' lives. Our mission is broader than pharmaceuticals; it is about driving healthcare solutions. Novartis is a leading company in gene technology and cell and gene therapy. The UAE is the third country in the world to approve a new technology for gene therapy for those with hereditary blindness. We collaborate with all the key stakeholders in all relevant areas. The UAE's Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHP) announced its plans to transform the country to become a major global pharmaceutical hub. The UAE aims to attract more than 75 major pharmaceutical firms by 2021. This is integrated into the government's objective to find solutions to provide better healthcare, as healthcare spending is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% through 2025. On top of that, the government truly understands that new technology makes a difference. They are focusing on ensuring that investment moves into innovation and technology because this provides long-term consistent healthcare.</p><p><strong>How does Novartis lead in enhancing the R&amp;D capacity of Dubai and the UAE's human talent in the healthcare sector?<br></strong>As a company, we believe in the power of cultural transformation for empowering our people to apply their full creativity to tackling scientific and healthcare challenges. Building up gene technology means, automatically, we are engaged in knowledge and technology transfer. This sophisticated segment of the industry ensures the transfer of expertise and technology is also at a high level, unlike the transfer happening in local manufacturing. We also want to continue building up the various types of congresses and symposiums we hold and bringing in overseas knowledge to the UAE. Third, we are working on how we can expand our clinical trials and clinical research on the ground here.</p><p><strong>What nuances and complexities are you dealing with in Dubai and the region in terms of bringing greater access to healthcare solutions?</strong><br>In general, Dubai is the perfect hub for the region because it is easy to attract highly qualified international experts, and it has excellent infrastructure and good connectivity within MENA. If you think about the Middle East, there are three different tiers into which we can segment MENA. One is finding countries that are really on the leading edge of innovation and supporting an innovative environment. Second, countries with systems based more on established medicine where it takes longer to register products and refresh your portfolio. Third are some markets where there are conflicts and wars; there you have a different responsibility as a pharmaceutical company. In these markets, we strive to ensure that patients get essential medicine that the government is not able to source anywhere else. For markets more focused on established medicine, the issue is how you can mature your portfolio and help their health systems further develop. It is about ensuring the right products get into the market and addressing patient affordability. On the other hand, in those markets where you have strong innovation, like the Gulf, Egypt, and Lebanon, it is about how patients can get early access to those innovative treatments. In this case, the UAE is well-positioned to launch immediately after the US and has positioned itself as one of the first countries to ensure such products are available. There are strong synergies between Dubai's ambitions to become a hub for healthcare and its vision of introducing global best practices in healthcare management, along with our commitment to delivering innovations across multiple therapeutic areas. The UAE is a robust launchpad for our innovations, facilitating access to the wider region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your assessment of the pharma market in Dubai and the MENA region?<br></strong>The pharma market in MENA is currently estimated at roughly USD32 billion and analysts expect it to grow to USD50 billion by 2025. The UAE will lead this growth with countries like Egypt. MENA is one of the fastest-growing emerging markets, driven mainly by sizable population growth, increased life expectancy, greater prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, and greater prioritization of healthcare services among the region's governments. More than 60% of medicines are imported, while local and regional companies' market share is growing steadily, covering mostly generic alternatives of medicines that come off-patent. There are more than 350 million people in this region, almost equal to the US' population. However, the region has widespread income inequality and far less spending per capita on pharmaceuticals than western countries. The global pharma market is estimated to be over USD1 trillion, with the US and China being the two largest, respectively. Meanwhile, MENA represents little less than 2% market share of global pharma spending. The region's dominant health issues are diabetes, hepatitis C, thalassemia, and sickle cell, in addition to other genetic diseases.</p><p><strong>What is the main inhibitor of growth of the pharma market in the region?<br></strong>The pharma industry is affected by prevailing macroeconomics; for example, the drop in oil prices in 2016 and 2017 led to a slowdown in public sector growth and heightened pressure on drug prices. In addition, geopolitical factors play a key role in preventing the region from reaching its full potential. Still, the biggest impediment to growth is access to medicine. The region has a sizable population that is growing, also in age, with many highly prevalent diseases, so access to adequate and newer treatment modalities is key. However, and unfortunately, we still see many patients pay out of pocket, with a number of countries in the region unable to provide necessary coverage to all these patients. </p><p><strong>What opportunities do you see in emerging markets?<br></strong>When I was the head of Wyeth MENA, my company, like other pharma companies, looked east, seeking growth and respite from market uncertainty in Europe and the US. We labeled emerging markets as an “accelerated growth opportunity," MENA being one of them. Many companies shifted their focus to these markets, as they found consumers able to afford largely out-of-pocket spending on its drugs. Soon thereafter some of these emerging markets went from boom to bust, and many suffered downturns or showed weaker growth forecasts. Many healthcare systems struggled to scale up adequately to provide needed care to its patients. Accordingly, this hopeful sentiment by pharma companies did not last long, while the US and EU countries started to do better, as many new products got approved, became available, and attracted attention back to the developed economies. Analysts expect this cycle to return, with strong growth expected to double revenue in the next 10 years in key strategic emerging markets. </p><p><strong>Many companies neglect this market. Is that an opportunity for you?<br></strong>They do not so much neglect it as pursue other priorities. It is expensive and challenging to enter a new market. Most of these innovations I talked about come from small to medium-sized biotech companies, and if they are not acquired by big pharma, they definitely want to focus on the US, large European countries, China, and Japan, and will probably seek to outsource the rest of the regions in the world, including emerging markets. These markets will be our opportunity, as it was for this purpose that NewBridge was created. We are looking into the space and developing a regional platform, bridging innovation from west to east and hence making NewBridge the partner of choice for innovative medicines in MENA. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What is the significance of value-based healthcare for Medtronic?<br></strong>Medtronic is one of the first companies to explore value-based healthcare by collaborating with academic entities worldwide to structure and bring it to life. If a patient goes to a value-based healthcare center, his or her fee will be connected to the outcome; the better the outcome, the higher the fee can be. Value-based healthcare also shifts the focus to utilizing innovation to align value across the entire patient-care continuum. Thus, aspects like patient flow, recovery times, and inventory management will become more efficient, and better outcomes will be delivered without increasing infrastructures' overall costs. With value-based healthcare, we can enhance global patient care by increasing accessibility and economic value in emerging markets where resources are already scarce.</p><p><strong>How can Medtronic help raise the healthcare standards in Dubai and the UAE?<br></strong>Medtronic is working on different ways to transform healthcare systems. The Netherlands Obesity Clinic was launched in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, its first expansion outside of the Netherlands. We are starting to see patients go through our systems in the two clinics. We have been exploring areas such as expanding remote support to cardiac patients. We have also been successful in building relationships that provide physicians with training to contribute to outcome-based learning and take a step forward in addressing physician scarcity in the UAE. There are still more patients to serve, as the Middle East and Africa have about 1.5 billion people, with many underserved. In many African countries, patients still cannot access affordable healthcare due to limited infrastructure or healthcare professionals. Dubai has made it easier for us to access these markets, and through collaborations with capital funds organizations we are able to enhance access to health services.</p><p><strong>How fast is AI being deployed in the medical world, and what are the more recent implementations worth celebrating?<br></strong>The shift from pay-for-service models to outcome-based models intersects directly with technology like AI. Data and measured outcomes will help drive value and accountability across the system. AI can be deployed in a way that enables technologies to be remotely administered, help physicians that are new to therapy develop knowledge, and allow us to deliver better outcomes to patients. One of our achievements in this area is the AI-powered Sugar.IQ diabetes assistant, which empowers patients to control their blood glucose levels more effectively. Data analytics will continue to increase and evolve over time. But today, the biggest opportunity we have is to give physicians both clinical and behavioral data to work with. The combination of those two will help providers make informed decisions and more effectively treat patients.</p><p><strong>What was the reasoning behind your recent acquisitions of Mazor Robotics and Abraaj Group Healthcare?<br></strong>Our strategy has three main components: quality, accessibility, and cost. The first involves innovation to improve quality and outcomes, the second involves globalization to increase access, and the final one involves economic value. Mazor and Abraaj fit in perfectly with these three strategic pillars because Mazor is an innovative product that makes it easier for physicians to utilize surgery space, make surgery faster, and allow for better recovery. Abraaj was more about addressing accessibility, especially in terms of the investments Abraaj has made. It is now called Evercare in Pakistan, India, and Africa, where infrastructure has yet to be built and accessibility is still an issue. </p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on your partnership with the UN on non-communicable diseases (NCDs)?<br></strong>In underserved communities, NCDs are on the rise, and those affected often face major barriers to care. We have developed community-based care systems around the world to strengthen these care systems and help populations take control of their health. We are engaging in partnerships across the sector to accelerate responses to NCDs, universal health coverage (UHC), and health worker shortages. Progress can be achieved when we listen to our partners and distill key lessons from their views and results achieved. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Dubai Science Park lead the way in building the R&amp;D capacity in Dubai?<br></strong>R&amp;D is a key component of our ecosystem, and we have seen increased funding from the public and private sector in recent years. The Dubai government's 2020 budget (its largest in history) will fill our business partners with the confidence to play a leading role in R&amp;D across science, energy, and the environment. Dubai Science Park contributes to R&amp;D capacity in Dubai by bridging the gap between industry and academia. We have brought together universities and businesses to collaborate on research solving real-world business problems. Through various initiatives and events, we have encouraged young people to pursue careers in science, which will contribute to R&amp;D in Dubai. And as a business enabler, we have continued to support R&amp;D by allowing companies to grow and thrive in the region. With our business-friendly framework and bespoke infrastructure, we can remove red tape and improve the ease of doing business, so our partners can get set up quickly and focus on R&amp;D.</p><p><strong>Do you focus on SMEs or particular types of companies to drive this backward integration?<br></strong>SMEs are the heart of Dubai's economy and supporting their growth is crucial to Dubai Science Park. By focusing on emerging and homegrown talent, we have become a key ecosystem enabler for Dubai's start-up scene and a hub for world-class companies. Dubai Science Park is a broad business community: while 60% of the companies are in the healthcare sector, we are home to food technology, renewable energy, and environmental businesses. Increasingly, there are growing opportunities in digital health as Dubai continues to take a leadership role in the deployment of innovative technologies. </p><p><strong>Why are pharmaceuticals a key component of Dubai's industrial strategy?<br></strong>Through the industrial strategy, Dubai expects to attract USD2.5 billion in investments in the pharmaceutical industry over the next five years, as it ramps up efforts to court international players to open up factories here. As we are working to make Dubai a hub for manufacturing, we have identified pharmaceuticals as a priority subsector. Initially, we were looking at conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing, and we explored some opportunities in generics, mainly driven by insurers and payers, with the government's support for local tenders. Looking at pharmaceuticals specifically, we identified generics as a good short-term opportunity. In the medium and long term, we are looking at biosimilars and new-generation sequencing. To this end, we welcomed our first advanced pharmaceutical manufacturing facility to Dubai Science Park in 2018. Pharmax Pharmaceuticals' USD34-million plant has an annual production capacity of over 200 million tablet and capsule dosage forms and is dedicated to the manufacturing and commercialization of pharmaceuticals targeting chronic conditions prevalent in the Middle East. It is already making a positive contribution to the local economy, directly through job creation and indirectly by helping Dubai become less reliant on pharmaceutical imports. This demonstrates to other pharmaceutical companies that Dubai is a profitable and strategic location for manufacturing and equipped with the infrastructure to support cutting-edge manufacturing.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and vision for Dubai Science Park for 2020?<br></strong>We will continue to create a business environment that helps companies thrive. In 2018, we launched Advanced Health, a networking platform for UAE healthcare stakeholders to explore important industry issues. Its initial success has given us the confidence to take it to the next level, with exciting talks and networking opportunities planned for our participation at Arab Health 2020. We will also continue the Green Leadership Series, a networking and knowledge-sharing event focused on sustainability and advancing Dubai's green economy. This is a strategic sector that we want to leverage and stimulate, and we will continue exploring high-growth verticals such as new-generation sequencing. Some of the ideas that we explore are inspired by emerging technologies, so we are flexible and adaptable to meet the demands of our business partners. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Phase II of DHCC both differ from and build off the success of Phase I?<br></strong>In Dubai Healthcare City's Phase I, which is dedicated to healthcare and medical education, we established the foundation of a healthcare ecosystem where investors, healthcare professionals, researchers, academics, students, and patients come together to benefit from this self-sustaining healthcare free zone in Dubai. We streamlined the process of setting up a business in DHCC through Masaar, an e-services system that combines clinical and commercial activities. We introduced a robust yet dynamic regulatory framework to spearhead the development of the health sector in the UAE and beyond. Phase II will build on this success to complement the DHCC ecosystem. Sitting on over 19 million sqft and overlooking the historic Dubai Creek and Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary, Dubai Phase II in Al Jaddaf will focus on preventative healthcare and wellness through specialized services such as rehabilitation, counseling, sports medicine, and elderly care for both residents and visitors. In 2019, Phase II welcomed residents to its first two residential projects, Azizi Aliyah and Al Waleed Garden Tower. In 2020, Clemenceau Medical Center Dubai, the first general hospital in Phase II, opened its doors to the public. A renowned name in the region and part of the Clemenceau Medicine network of hospitals, the new 100-bed hospital will further cement DHCC's position as a hub for quality healthcare and excellence. There are currently more than 40 projects under development in Phase II including the first Barraquer UAE Eye Hospital in the Middle East, one of world's leading eye clinics from Spain.</p><p><strong>What specialties are you looking to attract based on market needs?<br></strong>There are currently more than 300 specialties available in DHCC. Based on the free zone's current needs, we are looking to attract several specialties including ophthalmology, urology, nephrology, and anesthesiology. To identify future gaps, we are working with Dubai Health Authority as part of their 'Certificate of Need' guidelines to provide in-depth knowledge on the gaps of the UAE healthcare sector to help promote need-based investment. This will provide us with a long-term projection of the required specialties, and we will work towards developing our regulations in accordance with this certificate to address the requirements of priority areas to avoid a supply and demand imbalance in the market. </p><p><strong>How do increased R&amp;D capabilities factor into your agenda?<br></strong>Research is a main pillar of the DHCC ecosystem and an important factor to attract high-caliber physicians to Dubai. There are more than 55 research projects, including early phase clinical trials, currently registered in the free zone. Since 2018, the research department of Dubai Healthcare City Authority Regulatory has developed a robust mechanism to review research applications resulting in a reduction of more than 60% in assessment time and a 77% growth in research conducted. Recently, to empower our community members, we co-sponsored the 'Professional Diploma in Clinical Leadership and Innovation,' offering the program to our community at a 40% discounted rate. </p><p><strong>What are your other strategic priorities, and what are we looking forward to in 2020?<br></strong>The UAE can become a global leader in healthcare delivery through the agility of its government in responding to the impact of disruptive technologies. Since 2015, the country's leadership has launched several strategies, including the National Innovation Strategy, the AI Strategy, and Blockchain Strategy with the aim of being at the forefront of this fast-paced industry. In 2019, as part of designing an agile regulatory framework, we developed more than 80 new policies, 24 standards, and more than 30 guidelines in our nine areas of regulations covering healthcare professionals, operators, education, research, health data protection as well as commercial licensing, including a teleconsultation policy. Our priority for 2020 is to continue to develop our regulations to be responsive to the demands of the health sector, especially those brought by new technologies, to enable the development of the country's health sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is DHA's role in pioneering the sector and its leadership role in facilitating the implementation of technology in healthcare in Dubai?</strong><br>We are part of Dubai Future Accelerator Program within the Dubai Future Foundation. We are one of the first entities that signed up, and we take pride in calling ourselves one of the founders of the program. Through the accelerator program, we host four companies per cohort. We look at their technologies and accelerate the presence and availability of technology in Dubai, starting from proof of concept (POC) all the way through to implementation. So far, we have worked on 24 POCs, with several moving into implementation. We are guided by four pillars: optimizing quality, time, cost, and patient safety. Technology improves quality, reduces time, lowers cost, and ensures patient safety. Because of the influence of technology on these four pillars, DHA has been at the forefront of adopting technology and facilitating this adoption in the private sector as well. Often, we have providers and other stakeholders from both the public and private sectors implementing the innovative ideas coming out of the accelerator program. The private sector has been receptive and is keen to adopt such technologies.</p><p><strong>From where do you attract companies and their POCs for the accelerator program?<br></strong>We are open to POCs from companies from anywhere in the world. The important thing is that, if they come from abroad, we must help them engineer the POC carefully. What might have worked in their country might not work well in our country. We are extremely careful about engineering the right POC, making sure it will tick all the right boxes in terms of achieving what we want. There is no guarantee that a POC will be successful, though my team and I embrace failure as much as we enjoy and embrace success as well. These POCs, once engineered carefully, are documented in a mini contractual agreements or MoUs to protect both sides in terms of intellectual property or ownership of assets. We then move on to implementation. Key success factors have unfolded wonderfully, yet we are still learning three years into the program. We are benefiting patients and the patient ecosystem through certain touch points in a bid to improve the healthcare ecosystem. One of the best implementation methods is finding a doctor who wants to improve and use technology to more fundamentally change medicine. For every POC, we intend to choose a leading clinical professional to spearhead the technology. What is better is if they approach us and say there is technology in a specific part of the world, and we host that company in Dubai. An advantage of the accelerator program is the interaction with similar companies across sectors. There are companies hosted by Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, Dubai Police, Dubai Municipality, and others. The sharing of ideas creates even more ideas and innovations. We have seen them marry their ideas to create wonderful hybrid technologies like for education and healthcare or solar panels and construction.</p><p><strong>How your office is enhancing the human capabilities within the health sector?<br></strong>In 2017, we launched a training program called Awtaad, an Arabic word for tent stakes. We chose this name because we wanted to make sure there are “stakes" holding down and supporting the “tent," or the health sector. We started with change management and moved on to project management, training 50-100 people in this area. We are now moving on to health economics and AI. By the end of the current strategy, the Awtaad program will train 200-300 staff members on certain elements. These may not be mentioned in the strategy, but when we notice a gap in the DHA collective knowledge of 13,000 employees, we immediately propose an HR strategy through our own medical education department that will fill this gap. We strongly believe in building our human capacity and investing in our people. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Health insurance has come a long way in Dubai since its inception. What are the new updates?<br></strong>We have achieved our goal of ensuring essential health coverage for all Dubai visa holders; almost 99% of the population now has access to mandatory health insurance. As the market matures, we want to continue to enhance benefits for every insured member, add preventive screening programs, encourage employers to look beyond insurance for their employees' wellness, and provide an environment that supports the growth and maturity of the health insurance sector. In 2013, only 1.8 million people in Dubai were insured. Today, more than 4.9 million people are. In Dubai, we have 47 insurance companies licensed by DHA, 12 of which are participating insurers that provide policies for low-income workers. According to our e-claims data from January-September 2019, the gross claims are worth AED12.2 billion, and we have 7,752 healthcare providers, 75-plus insurance companies and third-party administrators, and over 12,280 insurance products. </p><p><strong>What initiatives have been introduced to enhance the benefits received by health insurance holders?<br></strong>In 2020, we introduced screening and treatment for three types of cancers under the Basmah initiative. We also introduced screening and treatment for hepatitis C. Both these programs aim to benefit lower salaried workers, as the programs are available for Essential Benefit Plan (EBP) holders. This initiative is in line with WHO's goal to eliminate hepatitis C by 2030. Additionally, to promote early screening and management of diseases, we have added diabetes, heart disease, newborn, and developmental screenings as part of the mandatory health insurance cover.  This ensures that we detect diseases early on, leading to better treatment outcomes, fewer complications, and reducing care costs. We want to focus on building an enhanced health insurance system and the provision of specialized services; on the other, while raising public health awareness, particularly about prevention of non-communicable diseases (NCD). We want to encourage employers to create a work culture that promotes healthy habits, so that together we create a culture of preventive healthcare. <br> <br><strong>How will two trends, the change in demographics and accelerating technological innovation, intersect to change the healthcare sector and its investment landscape? </strong><br>Technology has the power to transform healthcare, and this is no different in the health investment space. The challenge for health systems and technology providers is to design their technology to facilitate seamless integration into clinical workflows. This is the direction they are moving toward to allow technology and advanced analytics to support clinical care pathways, hospital efficiency, and reduce the workflow of health professionals and hospital management. Investment in healthcare will completely adapt to meet changing technologies and cater to changing demographics as well. Investment in robotic surgeries and the training of robotic surgeons is one such area.</p><p><strong>Telemedicine seems to be a major area of focus in Dubai's healthcare landscape. Can you tell us about your telehealth initiatives?</strong><br>A shift from the tradition methods of receiving care includes the use of smart technology such as telemedicine. It can support around-the-clock consultations and help in providing both specialized care and second opinions with specialists from around the globe, as well as provide initial consultation in key areas, saving patients time and providing enhanced convenience. In December 2019, we launched the Doctor for Every Citizen initiative to further our drive toward the use of latest digital technology. The 24/7 telehealth consultation program is currently available for UAE nationals for the family medicine specialty. In the first phase, it will include consultation for diabetes, allergies, hypertension, and dermatological issues, as these are the most common health concerns. In the future, more specialized services will be added. While it does not include emergency care, it does include initial diagnosis, referral, e-prescriptions for certain conditions, and even requests for lab tests registered online through the DHA's electronic patient medical record system for added convenience.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the health insurance market in Dubai?<br></strong>There are massive advancements and changes always affecting the sector. Healthcare spending is still growing and quite fast. Its growth will continue for several reasons. First, some specialties that are coming online are not as developed as in other markets like the US and Europe. Second, healthcare companies continue to invest heavily in technology, which means there is still healthy room for growth in the market. Looking at long-term trends, the economy has strong potential for growth because of current demographic trends. Dubai is the most obvious location if you want to develop your IT across the Middle East and Africa. It is a place that attracts top talent. Dubai has great potential, and the healthcare industry is investing heavily in the city.</p><p><strong>How would you characterize the government's regulatory framework for the industry? <br></strong>Making healthcare mandatory was a critical step in the development of this framework. This regulatory change was essential for the marketplace and has helped create a sustainable and forward-looking healthcare insurance market in Dubai. We have partnered with the regulator in Dubai, Dubai Health Authority (DHA), on a couple of initiatives. DHA is likely to push the sector to focus more on a prevention model than a treatment model. The question is how to really change the behaviors of the citizens. This is important for us, and we spread our actions across our relationships with not only our large corporate clients but our SME clients as well. Thanks to our powerful, worldwide presence, we are able to leverage international research on improving health through lifestyle changes. </p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on your latest unveiling of new technologies?<br></strong>When you are doing preventative care, you have many more touch points with your customers. Today, for instance, we do online risk assessments so people can better understand their health status. Through assessment, we provide guidance to people on what behaviors they can change to have the most positive impact on their health. The more we have this discussion, the more touch points are developed between ourselves and our clients. These touch points are mainly online and through our app. Additionally, when someone gets a disease, they must choose the best provider for them. All of this is leveraged by our online presence and technology because it allows us to provide the best service. Data is really critical for us, and it will become more important as we move forward. We need to have a better understanding of long-term healthcare trends and how to address them. We can use data to create a win-win situation for both the customer and the company by improving their health outcomes and reducing our costs. Innovation should be in pursuit of the real goal, which is positively influencing our customers' health. This is a long journey, and it is a process that never truly ends. Being a pure health services company is a huge competitive advantage because all of our investment is driven toward a single goal. We can be much more focused on funding research and transforming lives. </p><p><strong>What is at the top of your agenda for the immediate future?<br></strong>One element is always ensuring constant innovation for the future. We want to ensure we are always one step ahead in terms of our capacity to provide the best health solutions. This means leveraging new technologies. The second element is about expansion. We are targeting 30% growth for 2020. We can grow quickly, and expansion is a critical pillar of our operations. If we want to expand, we must also rely on the developments incumbent upon technological transformation and change. It is a balance between achieving the right growth and making sure that this growth is consistent with innovation and quality of service. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>BRAC has a huge set up in the UAE. How do you balance the need to think strategically with the challenges of running such a logistically complex business?<br></strong>Many believe that as a general manager, one shouldn't get too involved in the day-to-day business operations. On the contrary, I believe I must get 'too involved' in the business because if I don't understand the business, then I cannot do my duties as a leader. It is critical that leaders spend good amount of time where the actual work gets done, like with line managers. It is important to get into the guts of the business and understand the challenges. The further down the chain you go, the easier it becomes to come up with a strategy that serves your intended objectives. This way, you always walk away with a new insight or a new opportunity. I strongly believe in monitoring instead of micromanaging.</p><p><strong>As you suggested, having the right strategies in place is crucial. What about the competitive environment?<br></strong>The business environment that we are experiencing today is more volatile than ever. Technology and social media have completely changed the concept of competitive advantage. For a long time, companies could test and experiment; they could pilot a new concept or product and keep it confidential. At present, whatever you do and say is almost instantly transferable to your competitors. Pricing strategies, marketing strategies, and anything you pilot immediately gets into your competitors' hands. Every company, especially in the Middle East, must be digitally sound and continuously advance toward adopting technologies because that's the only and best way to be prominent. Apart from its esteemed reputation, BRAC has many digital initiatives in the pipeline to stand out from the rest of the competition. </p><p><strong>How has technology changed the industry in the UAE as a whole?<br></strong>I am personally inclined to focus on BRAC's digital transformation. Technology is making pricing much more transparent. For example, all online intermediaries are selling car rentals. They only use a piece of software that makes it convenient for the consumer to shop and compare, but a substantial percentage of revenue is generated through these types of travel intermediaries. They are getting better by the hour at comparing what different car-rental companies offer. The UAE's car rental industry is highly competitive, which means each company must always be on top of its game. Just relying on the company's reputation is not enough; there is a need to move forward and improve at all times. BRAC has always been customer focused, and, at present, only technology can make a real difference in customer service.</p><p><strong>How do you feel about the company's method of leadership?<br></strong>A leadership model works well when it is applied not only to one's specific talents and gifts but also areas for improvement. Important positions are held by many, but the model of leadership is not always same because it differs from person to person. Along the way, I have tried many leadership methods and combined those that worked well for me to generate a combination of various styles. Since the start-up stage, I have been refining my leadership method according to different situations. The greatest lesson I have learned in life is that I still have a lot to learn.</p><p><strong>How do managers stay in touch with the rest of the organization?<br></strong>BRAC has 10 managers. We conduct monthly “Coffee with GM" sessions with all employees, starting from cleaners and drivers to supervisors. The reporting managers of these staff members are not allowed to be present during the session. Listening to our employees not only gives us an insight of the various challenges we may have, but also opens doors to new suggestions and opportunities. The leadership of BRAC is dynamic and passionate. At the management level, we understand that if we take care of our employees, they will take care of our customers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How should companies in the sector adjust in line with the transformation of the car industry?<br></strong>The current economic climate dictates that the auto industry be innovative in its approach to acquire new customers and be resilient. Another challenge is to cope with the rapid advancement of technology. The entire world is going electric, and, in line with that, all the major companies are releasing electric cars. For Al Nabooda Automobiles, the first one will be the Porsche Taycan, followed by the Audi E-Tron. There has been so much disruption in this space that the entire business mentality must change to handle new challenges and opportunities. This change requires investments in infrastructure development of two kinds. First, the vehicle-charging infrastructure will need to be ramped up, and the automobile industry will need the support of the government in order to ensure that people can conveniently charge their cars. Second, automobile dealerships will have to make significant investments in special service center infrastructure and training of after-sales staff.</p><p><strong>How has the company evolved over the years, and how do you maneuver when there are slowdowns in the market?<br></strong>We started as a small establishment, selling a total of 300-400 cars a year, and in peak years, that figure jumped to 10,000 cars. We are among the world's largest Porsche dealers and control 40% of sales for Audi Volkswagen in the Middle East. During a slowdown, the most effective thing to do is to look at your cost structure and find areas for greater efficiencies. We have made significant investments in embracing digitalization and online technologies to be able to cater to the needs of our potential customers. Having said that, buying a car remains an emotional point of contact. That is the reason why we have developed our world-class showrooms and service centers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are Emirates' core values, and how do they align with those of Dubai?<br></strong>Dubai's incredible rise as a vibrant, thriving global city and Emirates' growth have always gone hand in hand. Emirates' growth as the world's largest international airline is due to a combination of factors: Dubai's visionary leadership and forward-looking ethos, entrepreneurial spirit, and the government's ability to successfully tap into the city's geocentric location to connect people and economies. Dubai's aviation ecosystem, which is at the heart of the city's economy, is not only an important driver of growth in its own right, but also underpins growth in other strategic sectors by providing essential connectivity and much needed air lift. Emirates has helped rally tourism and link trade opportunities for Dubai to become a global hub by serving one-third of the world's population within a four-hour flying radius, two-thirds of the world's population within an eight-hour flying radius, and almost 90% of the world's population with non-stop flights using the latest ultra-long-range aircraft. Emirates will continue to drive growth and further elevate Dubai's status as a global center for trade, tourism, and commerce. The next chapter of Dubai's future is firmly focused on harnessing science, technology, and innovation to steer it toward a sustainable future. Emirates will continue playing a key role in supporting Dubai's goals by developing transformational solutions to help reshape the future of aviation and ensure the airline keeps a leading role in the industry.</p><p><strong>What synergies will Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) bring to your operations?<br></strong>Our fundamentals as an airline are grounded in optimally connecting people and cargo from all corners of the globe through our home and hub in Dubai. Between DXB and DWC, we operate two cargo hubs capable of handling close to 3 million tons of cargo a year. Emirates Skycargo's fleet of 49 trucks link cargo through a bonded corridor between the two airports integrating them into a single hub, and allow efficient connection timings between cargo arrival at one airport and departure at another on a 24/7 basis. On the passenger side and looking further afield, we will unlock further growth once the expansion of DWC is adequately developed to cater to Emirates operations, which we envisage will happen at the end of the next decade. Once completed, DWC will build on the latest passenger experience and cutting-edge aviation technologies.</p><p><strong>What are your strategies going forward in terms of opening new markets and acquiring new aircrafts?<br></strong>In 2018, we launched four new passenger points including Santiago de Chile, London Stansted, Edinburgh, and Bali-Auckland. We also layered on frequencies to 20 cities and upgraded capacity on eight cities. In 2019, we launched a linked route between Bangkok and Phnom Penh, a new service to Porto, as well as Mexico City via Barcelona. On the fleet front, we will begin receiving our Boeing 777X aircraft in the next two years. The Boeing 777X will offer us a flying range with more passenger capacity, helping to power our network growth. It will also offer enhanced aerodynamics, less weight, and up to 18% more fuel efficiency.<br><br><strong>How do you envision the future?<br></strong>Much has changed in commercial aviation over the last 20 years, and the future of this industry will be defined by its ability to successfully navigate geopolitical and economic headwinds, and how fast it adopts innovation and new technologies, all while capitalizing on the significant passenger demand, which is shifting east. Airlines that lag behind will leave the door open for more agile competitors to take their market share. In the coming years, Emirates will scale up its operations to secure a stronger footing across new markets. We will operate as a leaner, more agile organization through utilizing cutting-edge technology to make the on ground and onboard journeys more efficient and seamless. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are your core competences?<br></strong>We are a consultancy firm that has exploited a niche in the market concerning the introduction of AI and machine learning into the transportation and mobility sector. We assist government and private entities prepare for these disruptive technologies in areas such as mobility integration, infrastructure implementation, and legislation and regulation. Dubai is a leader in the disruptive technology sector. While previously the idea was to identify the best options abroad and import them, over the past five years the emphasis has been on developing alternatives locally. Autonomous vehicles are a good example, where His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum wants 25% of all vehicle trips in Dubai to be autonomous by 2030, which is an impressive KPI. Duly, we have established our company perceiving a gap in the market as the majority of transportation consultancies provide similar services as part of a wider remit, and few are as niche and as focused on what we do as we are. We are engaged in all modes of transportation and smart mobility apart from aircraft; however, we do cover a range of services within ground transportation in and around airports. So, trams, taxis, micro-mobility such as e-scooters, and other modes are within our range.</p><p><strong>At what stage is Dubai in terms of transportation?<br></strong>If you look at the Middle East, Dubai is leading from the front. No other country has expanded as much and as well as Dubai. There have been major changes within a short time period in terms of metro, tram, and electric vehicles. The way Dubai has advanced in terms of infrastructure is phenomenal. The idea of building an oasis in the dessert has worked and Dubai is on track for sustainable long-term growth.</p><p><strong>How are you advising on big data for smart cities?<br></strong>We have a number of key projects such as the implementation of big data platforms. These platforms provide data from many sources such as cars, Google, population density, and GPS, and deposit it in a so-called 'data lake.' Then, we have a team of data scientists, data analysts, and transportation professionals who build models and implement and use cases to provide answers and a visual perspective of the data based on business requirements and client engagement. The beauty of big data is that you can take different data sets and implement it in different solutions for problems that you did not know existed. For example, we have tested different solutions that have helped us to reduce the idle time for taxis. Drivers can be notified about areas where there is more demand for taxis at a certain time, hence, improving the city's public transport usage. That's better than roaming around to get a ride which in turn increases delays and traffic. So big data can not only teach us a lot about transportation and people but also allow us to introduce more sustainable solutions for first- and last-mile travel patterns.</p><p><strong>What are the benefits of autonomous vehicles?<br></strong>Autonomous vehicles need to be smart at all times so that they can predict and react according to human behavior. They must know where they are and what surrounds them to be able to have e-learning capabilities. The benefits are many, including the potential to reduce congestion and use of land for roads and parking spaces, and adopt a shared mobility functionality. We can also witness a decrease in the number of cars. What's more, autonomous and electric vehicles can help us reduce our overall carbon footprint. It is still difficult to know exactly when this shift toward autonomous vehicles will happen, but Dubai and the UAE are already leading this transition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Dubai recognizes trade as a growth enabler for local and international businesses. The government has invested heavily to make trade easy for all local and international organizations. The free zones have enabled large multinationals to trade and operate out of their own warehouses with market leading transit times to basically anywhere in the world. One of the biggest markets in the region is Saudi Arabia, which is served easily through Dubai's advanced infrastructure. Fruitful partnerships across the public and private sectors are enhancing the confidence of regional and international investors and boosting competitiveness of the local maritime sector, which is promoted by R&amp;D, innovation, and smart transformation.</p><p><strong>How will Expo 2020 impact your operations?<br></strong>From a logistics point of view, Expo 2020 will have a significant and positive impact on the industry. The exhibition is expected to boost trade, logistics, and port operations across the UAE. The Expo will showcase the country's geographic positioning as well as DHL's capabilities and market leading transit times.</p><p><strong>What are DHL's latest advancements in technology and innovation?<br></strong>DHL is exploring how innovation in the logistics industry can support the future of transportation around the world and in the Middle East region. We have three innovation centers around the world in Germany, Singapore, and the US. We are looking at robotics, autonomous vehicles, and more. DHL has tested Baxter and Sawyer, two smart and collaborative robots, in its warehouses on co-packing and value-added tasks, such as assembly, kitting, packaging, and pre-retail services. The advancement of technology in the logistics industry is driving the adoption of collaborative robots to improve efficiency in the supply chain. We use drones in areas such as the rainforest.<br><br><strong>How important is sustainability?<br></strong>Going green is one of our main priorities. Our contribution to greater sustainability around the world is green logistics. To realize a more sustainable future, we believe it is important to think big. Our new climate protection target is to reduce all logistics-related emissions to zero by 2050. To help realize this target, we have established a number of ambitious interim goals across the main action areas of our sustainability strategy. The first is to increase our carbon efficiency by 50% compared to 2007 levels. Second, we are reducing local air pollution by operating 70% of our first and last mile services with clean pick-up and delivery solutions, such as bicycles and electric vehicles. Third, we are encouraging more than 50% of our customers to incorporate green solutions to amplify environmental sustainability across the supply chain. The fourth interim goal is to certify 80% of our employees as GoGreen specialists and get them involved in our environmental and climate protection activities. This includes joining partners to plant 1 million trees every year. We also minimize our consumption of water and paper.</p><p><strong>How is DHL positioned within the transport and logistics landscape?<br></strong>DHL is the leading global brand in the logistics industry. We offer an unrivaled portfolio of logistics services, ranging from national and international parcel delivery, e-commerce shipping, and fulfillment solutions to international express, road, air, and ocean transport and industrial supply chain management. With specialized solutions for growth markets and industries including technology, life sciences and healthcare, energy, automotive, and retail; a proven commitment to corporate responsibility; and an unrivaled presence in developing markets, DHL is positioned as the logistics company of the world. To meet the demands of over 1 million customers around the globe, DHL has over 4,000 offices in more than 220 countries and territories. They handle a total of 160 million shipments per year. DHL runs a fleet of more than 250 aircraft, operating 714 scheduled flights every day. We are conscious that we impact the environment and are striving to have the greatest positive impact, environmentally, socially, and economically. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Dubai become a logistics hub on the global stage?<br></strong>The two biggest factors behind Dubai's success are the Emirate's strategic location and the contributions of DP World and Emirates Airlines—both key market players that connect Asia and Europe through a broad range of operations. As the logistics sector has developed and expanded in the last two decades, DP World and Emirates Airlines have used more routes over longer distances and invested heavily in technology and human capital, contributing significantly to a competitive and sustainable logistics sector. As the market has transformed, shipment sizes have decreased while shipments themselves have become more frequent, emphasizing the flexibility of the logistics sector to promptly respond to changing markets demands while continuing to deliver world-class services. Furthermore, Dubai has established itself as a logistics hub on the back of world-class infrastructure such as seaports and airports. The scope of markets that Dubai serves as a hub continues to expand, particularly in terms of connectivity, and the Emirate is aiming to secure more opportunities as part of the Silk Road. Additionally, the adoption of e-commerce and our partnership with Amazon will present even more opportunities.</p><p><strong>How is Dubai South's Logistics District pioneering technologies and digitalization?<br></strong>Digitalization is among our top priorities as the Emirate transitions to paperless operations as part of the Dubai Paperless Strategy, in line with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to transform Dubai into a full-fledged smart city. We are upgrading our entire IT system with our own ERP software so that Dubai South has integrated applications to manage the business and automate all functions related to technology, services, and human resources.</p><p><strong>How is e-commerce changing demand and shifting strategic priorities for Logistics District?<br></strong>E-commerce is changing demand and shifting strategic priorities through EZ Dubai, a unique project launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed that has facilitated a whole zone dedicated to e-commerce. We have created a positive environment through this platform where less known entities and entrepreneurs have access to e-markets such as Amazon. E-commerce also comprises many multi-channel retail organizations and includes several elements ranging from large fulfillment centers to last-mile deliveries.<br> <br><strong>What developments are happening within the transport sector and how is Logistics District capitalizing on them?<br></strong>We recently launched a program in partnership with the University of South Wales dedicated to technology and sustainability within logistics and supply chains. This promises to be an important initiative as mobility and sustainability are two key themes of the upcoming Expo 2020. We have begun implementing several initiatives in relation to sustainability and there are many more still to come in the years ahead. We are in the process of automating all our processes, despite its many challenges, and we have hired a company to recycle all our plastic bottles.</p><p><strong>What is your vision and what are the strategic priorities for Logistics District moving forward?<br></strong>Our efforts are focused on technology and sustainability. There will be much less demand for labor as the UAE moves closer to automation. I recently met two professors from MIT and Harvard, and we discussed why Dubai has not become automated. The main challenges are cheap labor and the fact that most warehouses are still being operated by third-party logistics (3PL) companies. Cargo owners should be making investments moving forward and they can start by putting in place their own facilities, embedding innovative technologies and bringing in the 3PLs to manage the facilities. The reason they have not done this is because warehousing costs represent a small expense in their P&amp;L calculations—essentially meaning automation is not a priority. Nevertheless, in the month and years ahead, technology, sustainability, and e-commerce will become an integral part of all players in the sector.</p><p><strong>How is the Business Park, situated within Logistics District, using the synergies of Dubai South and complementing the Logistics District?</strong><br>Comprising 11 buildings with a total of 2.3 million sqft of office space, the Business Park fully complements the entire 145-sqkm Dubai South project. The park is carefully designed to facilitate the growth of all types of businesses, from start-ups to SMEs and multinationals. With complete turnkey business services and cost-effective office solutions, the Business Park is aligned to suit global business needs. Dubai South itself is the emerging face of Dubai. Its main components are the airport and two free zones—one for aviation and aerospace and the Logistics District. The Logistics District is meant to support Dubai's focus on trade and logistics and to develop a district that will link Jebel Ali Free Zone with the airport. The majority of companies do not need a warehouse in the Logistics District or a facility in the MBR aerospace hub; all they need is an office space, and this is where we factor in. In the aviation sector, we cater to private charter companies. There is a major market for new and used parts traders, drones, aviation management, air cargo, and aircraft. The Business Park brings together all these players in several industries to create large-scale business opportunities. </p><p><strong>How do innovation and sustainability play into what is happening at the Business Park?<br></strong>Innovation and sustainability are at the heart of our operations. This is the reason we continue to look for more ways to construct buildings according to LEED certification standards. Having a LEED-certified building helps tenants achieve higher environmental efficiencies. We provide many extra benefits that support our clients' sustainability goals.</p><p><strong>What additional features do you offer to facilitate activity and attract companies to the Business Park?<br></strong>In terms of soft features, we have worked with the government to come up with four different products and solutions. We also consult with business councils and country delegations to support companies from their own countries. We help them establish a company as well as network with the right people and institutions. We invite investors from different parts of the world to establish a networking office here at no cost. We want people to hear about the positive experiences of investors who have entered the local market. Another feature is the dual licensing service. Many companies have two registered offices in Dubai, one in a free zone and another outside the free zone for all their GCC operations and sales. At Dubai South, companies can keep their two registrations but under one location. This is significant because dual licensing has long been demanded by free zone companies and entrepreneurs who are interested in operating multiple enterprises across the wider UAE market. There are already about 10 companies that have utilized this advantage, and their annual savings were about AED1 million.</p><p><strong>How do you educate companies on these opportunities?<br></strong>We do it through digital marketing, tapping the easy access to mobile devices as well as social media. We also engage in international forums and conferences with our partners from other government entities such as Dubai FDI, Dubai Chamber, and the Ministry of Economy, in addition to indirect marketing through local and international business agents. We are progressively changing the perception that it is expensive to set up a business in Dubai. We have also made it easier by providing online portals where one can establish their company from their home country.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020?<br></strong>We aim to attract more companies related to aviation and logistics and provide them with quality support. Being an entrepreneurial hub, 20% of our customers upgraded from our business centers. Their business is growing, and they have been moving with us to bring their companies to the next level. To date, we have achieved 88% retention rate. We have not increased rents or fees for the past four years and have no plans to do so. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the unique features of Click's Omega platform?<br></strong>Omega is a platform connecting all types of aviation companies, mainly private jets. We wanted to create networking opportunities for all stakeholders, including travelers looking for private jets and private jet operators looking for suppliers, and sometimes intermediate companies, to support their trips. At Click Aviation Network, we have a unique perspective and experience in this field, so we bring our expertise to create a better user experience and promote private jet traveling. There is a lack of awareness about the availability, affordability, and benefits of private jet travel. At Click, we wanted to have this platform available for people to not only use it for booking flights but also to educate them about options beyond commercial airlines and the charter jets.</p><p><strong>Are you promoting these alternative forms of travel to the end consumer or to charter brokers?<br></strong>Charter brokers work with us. They provide the services to the end users. We focus on the B2B space. By supporting charter brokers and customers, we can bring more travelers into the industry. Through the Omega platform, charter brokers can access flight and route availabilities across operators to find flights that best match the client's needs. Recently, we acquired the largest charter platform application in the US. We are now taking this concept worldwide. We have already started in Europe.</p><p><strong>What are the opportunities created by Dubai's aviation hub?<br></strong>Dubai-based companies, in any industry, have a certain level of credibility. Dubai is the regional aviation hub for Africa and the Middle East. People are willing to live and work here. This is the strong factor that is making Dubai a hub, and we are happy to be a part of the aviation hub. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Dubai Airports incorporated innovation?<br></strong>Many companies are struggling with innovation because they see it as a background or as a separate activity. Innovation is a fundamental part of what people need to move forward in today's business world. We are constantly working on transporting people through the facility in the fastest possible time and with the best possible service. We have to reimagine the future of airports. We have to be leaders in providing aspiration, hope, and inspiration to think differently. The vision and leadership of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, is incredibly supportive in this endeavor. Having inherited this company from one-third of the size it is today, I would like to see it continue the same trend by thinking differently, making things happen, employing the right people, developing talent, making ourselves financially sustainable, catering for growth, and improving service quality.<br><br><strong>In what ways is Dubai Airports creating the future of airports?<br></strong>People will always rethink the role of airports in the future, but perhaps most importantly, the relationship between the ground and air products that an airport manages has to change. One interesting way to look at this relationship is through the lens of sustainability and alternative fuel sources. Alternative energy sources are much easier to implement to ground transport because there is the possibility to refill. My vision is a transport system whereby a driverless pod will turn up at your home to take you directly to your airplane. We must create competitive journeys and improve our offer, allowing the entire enterprise of Dubai to become more successful and profitable. If we can offer services that other cities and countries cannot match, people will travel with us and Dubai.</p><p><strong>How is the Real Time DXB platform helping Dubai Airports to enhance the user experience?<br></strong>Around 280,000 people go through our facilities on a busy day. We are using technology to track every single component of the passenger journey. We already have an excellent technology infrastructure that enables us to track every single activity in real time. Moreover, using the airport community app, I can look at every single area of the airport using a mobile. Another example is putting baggage systems online, so you can track your bag just by scanning your bag tag. What gets measured gets managed, so we are measuring everything we can. Recently, we went an entire week without any bag missing its transfer flight; this is a remarkable feat for an organization of our size. Using breakthrough technologies to monitor and predict what people want is the way forward.</p><p><strong>What is the future of the airport experience?<br></strong>An airport must reflect the personality of the city because it forms the first and last impression for visitors. Sometimes people do not think of airports as places of hospitality and customer service but as facilities for planes. Our challenge is to turn this idea on its head and to treat people as guests. Recently, we strived to eliminate walking distances and implemented the DXB taxi experience, a free buggy service. In the first month, 275,000 people used it. We would like to get more light in the building and cover all our roofs with solar panels so that we can source 10% of our total energy from renewable sources. There are plenty of things we are looking at, and we are working on an entire master plan.</p><p><strong>What impression are you planning make on people coming for Expo 2020?<br></strong>I want people to say their experience at Expo 2020 was fabulous in every respect. You only get one chance to make a good first impression, and we are trying to achieve both a fantastic first impression and an enduring image of Dubai. Dubai has to act as a holistic city, and we have to work to make sure every single component reflects that and our tradition of excellence. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is DACC building aviation expertise and driving the sector to new heights?<br></strong>Our strategy stems from the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to make Dubai the aviation capital of the world. With this in mind, we are building an aviation ecosystem that includes airports, aviation-related businesses, and learning institutions. When it comes to aviation-related businesses, there are many types of services that support general aviation such as maintenance, repair, and overhaul services (MROs). Cargo and catering services are included in this segment, and Emirates Skycargo and Emirates Catering are two companies that have now moved to Dubai South. When DACC first opened for business, it aimed at attracting the world's major aviation companies, and the majority have set up their business operations here. However, we believe SMEs play an essential role in providing a holistic range of services for the aerospace industry. All these businesses require talent; therefore, we have partnered with the University of South Wales, which has set up a campus here to provide training dedicated only to aviation. In addition, Dubai South hosts the Dubai Air Show, which continues to witness growth. When it kicked off, it become the largest air show in size with the highest number of exhibitors and visitors so far, and we are building on that success.</p><p><strong>How is DACC pioneering innovation in the aviation sector?<br></strong>Since the industry is involved in a chain of processes, we are digitally connecting the entire cycle. Going digital means access to facts and data that are key to good decision making for any business. Another aspect is tapping innovation and technology to advance Dubai's aviation ecosystem, and we have been working with 3D companies to explore the possibilities of developing spare parts for airplanes.</p><p><strong>How does sustainability factor into this holistic ecosystem?<br></strong>We are taking measures to generate alternative sources of energy. However, energy is only one aspect of our sustainability efforts. For example, Dubai South is the first community in the Emirate to bring an electric bus model made in Australia. This is part of a larger plan to connect the whole of Dubai South through a form of light rail or electric bus system. From a food security perspective, we are implementing the latest innovation in modern farming to build one of the largest vertical farms and establish a JV for land-based fish farming. These are just some of the plans and initiatives in the pipeline. </p><p><strong>What does Dubai South mean for the Emirate, and what is the vision for leveraging the legacy of Expo 2020? <br></strong>It is of great pride that Expo 2020 is taking place in Dubai South. Once Expo 2020 officially opens to the world, our exhibit terminal can provide a platform to transport people, not to mention the key role of Al Maktoum International Airport for travelers and visitors coming for the Expo. We are confident that there will be a spillover of visits to Dubai South for businesses and visitors to witness firsthand what we do here. In terms of aviation, we are building extensively to promote Dubai as a global capital for aviation as we are in the process of building the largest airport in the world. In addition to that is the Mohammed Bin Rashid Aerospace Hub, which provides the platform for many other aspects of aviation. We are proactively gaining ground as a global e-commerce hub, having brought Amazon to Dubai South. We are confident that all the activities that will transpire during Expo 2020 will bring the biggest benefits to Dubai South, a futuristic community that will improve Dubai's status among the best and most sustainable places in the world to visit, work, and live in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Could you provide an overview of MBR Aerospace Hub?<br></strong>MBR Aerospace Hub is a 7-sqkm business aviation and aerospace hub in Dubai South that offers private jet maintenance, aviation education, and training services. It also houses a VIP terminal, which went operational in 2016. Manned by our highly skilled professionals and technicians, MBR Aerospace Hub was able to capture over 70% of Dubai's private jet segment. In our business aviation segment, we have five fixed-base operators (FBOs) and two hangars for private jets. Falcon has already completed and commissioned its hangar. We are working with other players as well to build a maintenance center for commercial aircrafts. Apart from these facilities, we also house maintenance shops, the Lufthansa Technik for components, and GE's On Wing Support. At MBR Aerospace Hub, we bring together multinationals and SMEs to create a vibrant regional and global aerospace sector. We create value and synergy by leveraging our wide networks and the close proximity to Al Maktoum Airport, an international hub, and the Emirates Sky Cargo, which is connected to Dubai International Airport. In addition to our airport access, we are also linked to freighters and cargo via the Jebel Ali Port coupled with modern road networks. Moreover, we are less than an hour's drive from Abu Dhabi International Airport. MBR Aerospace Hub is a strategic development when it comes to the aerospace industry. With 35% of the development activities taking place in full swing, the hub is expected to be fully completed by 2030.</p><p><strong>What is your role in building capacity and developing Dubai's aviation and aerospace sector?<br></strong>In a short span of time, MBR Aerospace Hub has enabled the industry's development. We provide the infrastructure and plug-and-play solutions to minimize the capital expenditure requirements of our partners. We are also proud of our state-of-the-art education premises in which we plan to house simulation centers, universities, and vocational training institutes to train pilots, cabin crew, professionals, and technicians. In November 2019, we inaugurated dynamic and advanced training facility for cabin crew. Through this, we aim to help address the labor shortage in the aerospace and aviation industries.  </p><p><strong>What role does MBR Aerospace Hub play in Dubai South's development, and how is it helping to build synergies there?<br></strong>Dubai South has different and connected business districts, and their activities mainly revolving around the airport. Our focus at MBR Aerospace Hub is on private jets, separate from commercial airlines, as well as specialized landside and airspace supply chain to support operators on the airside.</p><p><strong>How is MBR Aerospace Hub looking to leverage its new brand and increased visibility to make Dubai the aerospace capital of the world?</strong><br>The rebranding was done to fulfill the vision of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to make Dubai the aviation capital of the world. To date, AED2.5 billion has been invested in the MBR Aerospace Hub, and we aim to hit the AED17-billion mark. This will position MBR Aerospace Hub as the leading aerospace hub in the region and the world.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities going forward into 2020?<br></strong>Until 2021, our focus will remain on the business aviation segment, which is quite mature now. Dubai's business aviation segment is known globally and we want to build on this to position the Emirate's maintenance capabilities on the international stage. We are also working on reinforcing the light manufacturing sector, both building local capabilities and attracting global players. We are expecting a positive year for the business aviation and aerospace industries, fueled by activities brought forth by Expo 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What challenges do you face in implementing new, futuristic modes of transport, and how do you overcome them? <br></strong>The main challenges in relation to the self-driving transportation field in particular include addressing public concerns and fears in relation to safety, security, and privacy of the new transport modes and technologies; customizing the rapidly developing transportation trends, technologies, and modes to suite the local conditions of land use and urban planning; understanding the impact of the future trends, technologies, and modes on the urban fabric of cities; funding the new modes and systems and making them available to the public at affordable prices to ensure access to mobility for all segments of society; ensuring smooth and efficient transition of conventional transport industry to future transport industry; and fostering partnerships between the government and private sectors. However, RTA does not look at the development of a smart transport infrastructure and services as a challenge but as an opportunity that can yield significant benefits to our city. RTA is seeking to introduce an array of enablers to be developed in a parallel manner. They include enacting legislations and rules for self-driving transport, enhancing public acceptance of this technology, developing conditions and regulations for testing and licensing of self-driving vehicles, chalking up a structure for insurance and liability, and creating a cybersecurity framework.</p><p><strong>What strides has RTA made in developing autonomous transport in Dubai?<br></strong>In Dubai, we are open to new ideas and technologies and we are not afraid to take educated risks and challenges. Some of the examples are the longest driverless metro system in the world, testing of different driverless modes including autonomous pods and automated flying taxis, and studying the hyper-loop technology. The test run of the first autonomous air taxi capable of carrying two passengers was a success. The move also echoes Dubai's Smart Autonomous Mobility Strategy, which seeks to shift a quarter of the total number of trips in Dubai to autonomous modes by 2030. Another objective is to enhance the integration between mass transit modes and people by providing smooth, fast, and innovative transit modes. The Enterprise Command Control Centre was launched in May 2007 as a central command center of all mass transit systems as well as traffic systems. It acts as a platform that integrates all current and future transit modes under one roof. The control room is linked with 34 high-tech systems within the RTA and can handle the feed of about 11,231 surveillance cameras. It offers state-of-the-art control of roads and transport systems utilizing smart technologies in simulating real-life scenarios. It supports central decision-making in respect of all transit means and assists strategic transport planning as well as integration with RTA's main systems and traffic control centers. In addition, the center copes with future transport challenges such as the use of big data, simulators, AI, and the use of machine learning.</p><p><strong>What are the latest updates of RTA's Route 2020 project, and how do you evaluate the impact of Expo 2020? <br></strong>In preparation for a successful Expo 2020 exhibition, RTA has developed an integrated plan to serve the exhibition. The plan includes integrated solutions to provide smooth and safe mobility of people. The execution of this plan has already started with the extension of the metro's red line. Furthermore, a number of bus stations will be provided specifically to serve Expo 2020. A network of roads and interchanges of around 85km with a total cost of over AED3.2 billion is currently under development to provide flexibility in getting in and out of the exhibition. Other projects include the ITS2020 program to build a new traffic management center and its associated systems as well as the Enterprise Command Control Center (EC3). The total cost of transportation infrastructure and other initiatives and systems provided by RTA to serve the Expo is estimated at around AED18 billion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What opportunities are you looking at in the real estate sector?<br></strong>Dubai has always offered incredible opportunities; you just need to keep your eyes and mind open to them. If you stay open-minded and focused, Dubai is an amazing place. The real estate market hit a lull, but we have seen the worst and it will go up from here. One of the contributing factors to the upswing is the improving political situation in the region. Soon enough, all the GCC countries will come back together again like brothers. Outside the GCC, the situation in Iraq is also improving, and we are continuously improving ties with India. The demand will always bounce back in Dubai because everyone wants to live here. We will see this pick up even more and the market regain its strength as Dubai continues to build its tourism offering. It is a fabulous tourism destination with an expanding offering.</p><p><strong>How has the uptick in demand for real estate and tourism influenced RSG Group of Companies' transition from residential real estate to the hospitality segment?</strong><br>We recently completed the Burj Sabah, a residential development with 228 units for mid- to high-income tenants and leased the entire building to a corporate tenant. Now, we are shifting our focus to the hospitality sector. The hotel segment is doing well, even though there is a lot of downward pressure on prices. We have one hotel under construction now and another in the concept stage, both on Sheikh Zayed Road. There is growing demand in the hotel segment, and this is what the government wants and is leveraging on as part of its vision. The government wants to build more hotels and attract more tourists. It is becoming a bit hard for operators and landlords, but there are always winners. Aligned with these initiatives, we have been quite bullish about the market and have continued investing during the downturn. RSG Group has been working in Dubai for 23 years, and it is still building. We are working on a unique concept in the food and beverage space as part of our building in Bay Square, proving, regardless of naysayers, there are always opportunities. Profits have come down for every investor, but Dubai is still the best place to live.</p><p><strong>Are you seeing the sentiment change among international investors too with the new residency laws?<br></strong>Many in the market are worried about Dubai after Expo 2020, but I believe in the vision of the Dubai government and HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The government is prepared to leverage the legacy of Expo. The world's greatest exhibition is set to attract 20-25 million visitors to the Emirate; if only 5-10% choose to live, study, or work here, it will be a fabulous economic stimulus. It is not just about bringing visitors for Expo; it is about introducing them to Dubai and making a good first impression for people to relocate here. To anyone interested in Dubai after Expo 2020, in particular individuals who missed the opportunities in 2006-2008, this is the right time to buy. Moreover, Dubai has matured as a market over the years, which investors can see from the Dubai Land Department's statistics.</p><p><strong>Being in the real estate ecosystem, do you feel a portion of the responsibility to contribute to the revival of the sector?<br></strong>Dubai is my home, and I am doing my part to make Dubai a special place for everyone. In addition to favorable tax frameworks, Dubai is an incredibly diverse place. People of every nationality can call Dubai home because 85-90% of its population is made of expatriates. The city offers phenomenal infrastructure, security, lifestyle, a prime location, and incomparable flight connectivity. Growth will continue beyond Expo 2020 because 2021 marks the 50th anniversary of the UAE, which will bring renewed and updated ambitions to drive the Emirate forward.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for RSG Group as we look ahead to the turn of the decade?<br></strong>RSG Group's strategy has always been, and will continue to be, to go at a sustainable pace; we do not enter into too many projects. This helps us maintain our quality and let our work speak for itself. We deliver top-quality developments on time, which is what we are known for in the industry. We owe this reputation to our incredible team. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>According to the Department of Economic Development, 3.8% growth is expected for 2020. How will real estate and construction capitalize on this growth? <br></strong>The relationship between real estate and the economy is symbiotic. When the economy performs well, we see an uptick in real estate transactions. Conversely, a boost in investments in the property market activates other sectors of the economy. Dubai's real estate has been a vital aspect of the UAE's non-oil economy, bringing investments from all over the world. Today, Dubai is witnessing economic growth on the back of key government initiatives such as long-term visas for investors and skilled professionals, 100% foreign ownership of businesses, and the establishment of the Higher Committee for Real Estate. Consequently, these initiatives are having a positive impact on the real estate market. In November 2019, the Dubai Land Department recorded over 5,000 transactions, marking an 11-year high. Additionally, with Expo 2020 on the horizon and its projected impact on the Emirate's GDP, we are confident that the real estate market, which has been witnessing a cyclical slowdown over the last two years, will stabilize. Moreover, the government's foresight, best exemplified in the theme for 2020, which focuses on creating a growth strategy for the next five decades, reaffirms the positive long-term outlook for non-oil sectors.</p><p><strong>As DAMAC completes its 40,000-plus units in progress, what trends will impact luxury real estate development in Dubai? <br></strong>To achieve a balance between supply and demand, developers must limit new launches. At DAMAC, we are focused on projects that are already in the construction pipeline, and we have adopted this prudent strategy to ride softer market conditions and enable long-term growth. The concept of luxury real estate is changing, and today it is more about the experience of living in a holistic environment. Given this trend, the real estate sector is evolving into a service industry, in which delivering units is just the beginning of the relationship between the developer and the customer.</p><p><strong>Dubai's boldness, when it comes to innovative construction and development models, is undeniable. How does DAMAC align with this when undertaking projects? </strong> <br>Dubai's majestic skyline and real estate infrastructure inspire people from all over the world. However, Dubai is evolving, and customers expect more than just great interiors and brand associations. They are looking for wholesome communities that align with their personalities, passions, and lifestyles. At DAMAC, we have been at the forefront of creating properties that align with our customers' aspirations. Our multi-million sqft, mixed-use master developments, DAMAC Hills and AKOYA, offer a glimpse of the future of luxury living. At DAMAC Hills, for example, we provide a diverse range of luxury residential villas, townhouses, and apartments to meet the different needs and desires of customers along with a plethora of community spaces, activities, and amenities for residents to enjoy. The 18-hole Trump International Golf Course Dubai, a horse stable, a 4-million sqft park, a skatepark, a tennis academy, supermarkets, and various other life-enhancing features make this community luxurious and appealing to different customer segments.</p><p><strong>DAMAC was recognized as Property Developer of the Year by International Business Magazine. How does DAMAC Properties plan to lead the luxury real estate sector?</strong><br>DAMAC has been a pioneer in introducing branded luxury residences in Dubai and around the world. We have created iconic projects in association with the world's most renowned brands such as Just Cavalli, Paramount Hotels and Resorts, and Versace Home, to name a few. Our brand promise is 'Live the Luxury,' and we have exemplified our vision by delivering over 4,000 branded residential and hotel units so far. Our approach to luxury has always aligned with the evolving aspirations of our discerning customers, and we will continue with this approach in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are some of the recent residential developments in Dubai South?<br></strong>The residential district is a major component of the bigger puzzle, complementing the airport at the center of the master-planned city. We are extremely proud of what we have achieved thus far, and have big plans for the future. As one of the eight key districts of Dubai South, the residential district is an innovative concept of urban living that aims to create a city based on the happiness and well-being of the people. Dubai South's master-planned communities will be distinguished by their world-class design, superior build quality, and a wide range of lifestyle amenities. Another unique aspect that makes Dubai South's residential district noteworthy is the fact that it addresses key concerns of residents. Together with our partners, we are building a unique community that is distinct from the downtown area. We took the initiative of developing our own piece of real estate called the Pulse. This is almost 1,600 units with townhouses and one- to three-bedroom apartments with handover beginning in December 2019. Notably, we offer something for every segment of the market. Our aim is to attract people and create a community and city of the future. We want to make sure we have state-of-the-art infrastructure. We are doing a major landscape project and building parks. We are also creating a great retail space and dedicating plots for schools and hospitals. We do not want to compete with the private sector when it comes to retail. We want be partners and develop a curated retail experience.</p><p><strong>Are you still inviting third-party developers to contribute to the Dubai South's residential community?<br></strong>Some plots have already been sold to third parties. Some are under construction, and others are entering the construction phase. We are willing to sell more, but we want to distinguish ourselves from other middle-income housing by being selective. We have some studios as part of the mix, but we will control that number as our primary demographic is families.</p><p><strong>How does Sakany, the staff accommodations, add to the sustainability of the ecosystem?<br></strong>Sakany is a community concept built around employee happiness, well-being, and productivity. The first phase comprises 10 buildings that are currently home to more than 6,000 staff and high-skilled laborers. Expanding on current capacity, we are building six additional buildings to be delivered by the end of 2019. We manage all the services for them. We provide breakfast, lunch, and dinner with food choices catered to their preferences. We have landscaped the area for activities, including a football and cricket pitch. The internet is a key aspect of modern life, and in the new phase, free internet will be provided across Sakany. As of now, we also have a temporary retail space in Sakany, and by April 2020, we will have a full retail center.</p><p><strong>Are there other developments within Dubai South's residential district in progress?<br></strong>This is a huge master plan, with 140km of space. Third parties are necessary and will be crucial to making this place a success. We will be at the forefront to make sure this ecosystem works. There is a need for mid-income housing, and people from Dubai will not come here unless the right product is offered. That does not mean we will not do high-end projects. We have a distinct edge in this segment because we have the expertise and team for high-end, as well as the synergies to offer such quality at a lower price point.</p><p><strong>What will Dubai South look like in five years?<br></strong>Dubai South is set to become a mature development with an appealing landscape and cohesive community. It will be a great place for people who want a break from the hustle of Dubai. Our location is unique, especially our proximity to the airport and logistics hub. Being next to the airport will always be an advantage, as will being close to the Expo. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the latest updates for the projects currently under development?<br></strong>We are creating communities where people feel good about living and working, and this is especially true for One Za'abeel, an iconic addition to the city and a must-visit destination that will be completed by end of 2021. It is a 230,000-sqm mixed-use project with two towers standing at 300m and 235m respectively, and a panoramic sky concourse dubbed “The Link" suspended perpendicularly to both towers. The Link, which is being constructed in six different stages, will house the largest cantilever in the world. Tower B is purely residential while Tower A is a mix of luxury serviced residential and grade A office space. It will also include Dubai's only urban resort. One Za'abeel will offer extensive amenities, including restaurants with Michelin-quality chefs.</p><p><strong>What makes One Za'abeel unique in Dubai's real estate development space?<br></strong>One Za'abeel represents the future of mixed-use developments. People nowadays seek walkability and proximity to the city's nerve centers in a sustainable environment, and we are providing them with that and more. Our architectural aesthetic is simple in terms of design, but highly complex from an architectural standpoint insofar as we spend a great deal of time studying the impact of the structure and its environmental and shading effects. We are also working on acquiring LEED Gold certification.</p><p><strong>How do projects like One Za'abeel contribute to Dubai?<br></strong>We ensure that our developments improve and positively augment existing communities. We focus on sustainability as evidenced by our Deira Enrichment Project, where we prioritized green spaces over cement blocks, identified missing elements, and expanded the fabric of the community while respecting the culture and history of Deira. With the Deira Enrichment Project, we understood that the structure of the location had to be accounted for in every step. We listened to all the stakeholders before breaking ground, and this is one of the reasons why this project is so successful. Similar to One Za'abeel's proximity to public transport, the Deira project includes two metro stations and we are now building the first integrated transportation hub. The government allocated a large capital to the metro system, and our role is to ensure that the top-side development will maintain the viability of that investment. Phase I of the project will serve 8,000 residents and 4,000 staff members. The first delivery will be toward early 2020, and we are hoping to finish the project by the end of 2023.</p><p><strong>Do you see other developers adopting a similar approach to Ithra?<br></strong>We have been mandated by the Investment Corporation of Dubai to look at both the bottom line and our added value to the Emirate. Other developers are starting to think along the lines of this formula, which ensures a win-win for all. The positive impact is easily assessed in the context of Deira Enrichment Project for instance through the growth of economic activity. Deira accounts for around 10% of Dubai's GDP with its proximity to education, business, and healthcare facilities and its waterfront market. This unique food market is one of the largest in Dubai, accommodating 30,000 people a day.</p><p><strong>Moving forward, what is your vision for Dubai's real estate sector?<br></strong>The government has taken many initiatives to reduce the cost of living, and we want to make sure that our developments advance the economy and benefit the environment. We will maintain our growth trajectory as we mature while espousing the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, with a focus on attracting new investments, encouraging small businesses, and creating enriching communities that connect people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have your recent developments intertwined with your commitment to Dubai?<br></strong>We are proud to serve as a catalyst to the UAE's vision and development through our projects. We believe that Dubai will continue to inspire through its growth and innovation, it being an outstanding platform for the business community and individuals to live, work, and thrive in. Construction and delivery marked our 2019, with an emphasis on accelerated building and completions. From 1Q-3Q2019 alone, our contractors have casted over 117 slabs, poured over 165,000 tons of concrete, erected over 45 cranes, and constructed over 120,774sqm across our ongoing projects. As a developer, we are active in many parts of Dubai, but we have specifically focused on the Emirate's prime up-and-coming areas. We work diligently to ensure that our locations are of the utmost value to the client and will appreciate over time. The size of our developments is also important—more and more of our buyers are young people who require the same level of luxury but smaller homes. So, our portfolio includes studios and one-bedroom apartments, with many of them being delivered in 2020. With the Expo coming up, 2020 will be a whole different ball game.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for capitalizing on Expo 2020 and its knock-on effects?<br></strong>First and foremost, we have a large concentration of projects in Expo 2020's vicinity with direct connectivity to the site, including the new Route 2020 line. The site will also continue to be a vibrant hub of culture and leisure even after the event. We may launch a small number of additional projects in Al Furjan, an up-and-coming community with easy accessibility to the site. We also have a short-term home rental concept through which we manage and service our customers' apartments. We plan to extend this model to several of our residential buildings. Moreover, we are also looking into converting some of our properties into hotel units. More importantly, we have been in touch with the Expo committee to have a physical presence in the hub's center. We believe that Expo will not only result in an increase in visitors, jobs, business, and infrastructure investments, but will also drive forward the vision of Dubai.</p><p><strong>How is Azizi Developments staying agile in the ever-changing real estate landscape in Dubai?<br></strong>Following our recent restructuring efforts, which took approximately 12 months, we have adjusted to market conditions and are operating more efficiently than ever before. We became tech savvy thanks to a major digital transformation. We have become even more customer-centric and have built an experienced team of industry experts, responsible for reviewing and analyzing our business model and offerings to provide corrective actions as and when required. Through our knowledgeable team and other market intelligence channels, we have a solid understanding of our customers' wants and needs.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you see in 2020 and beyond?<br></strong>We are on a promising growth trajectory. From today until 2022, we will be generating substantial revenue and increasing our top and bottom lines from our 54 ongoing projects, 76% of which are already sold, through swift construction and delivery. Up until 2025, we are planning to launch and deliver another 130-plus projects through our strategic partnerships with Dubai's key master developers, which granted us an extensive land bank that we can choose to acquire and develop. Our growth is furthered by the generation of additional revenue streams from new businesses that we are looking into, such as retail and commercial developments, hospitality, leasing, and brokerage services. We have nascent geographic expansion plans in high-growth markets, particularly in neighboring emirates and countries that offer strong development prospects, such as Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Moreover, we are looking into more mature markets, such as Germany, France, and the UK, as well as markets in North America. We want to demonstrate that a UAE-based developer can develop world-class projects across the globe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Is Dubai's real estate market shifting to a new profile of investors or buyers?<br></strong>This is a dynamic situation, and every year will be different. Now, we see population growth of around 5%. There are currently 500,000 homes here, and every year, we must add 25,000 units if we are to accommodate a 5% annual increase, which is close to USD30 billion. When there was 7% growth in 2018, we saw a market size of around USD40 billion.</p><p><strong>How does Sobha react to volatility in the market?<br></strong>The real estate business around the world is cyclical; however, there is always a minimum requirement. Dubai can accommodate 10-12 million people. In 22 years, assuming a minimum 3.75% annual growth rate, Dubai will hit 10 million people. I see growth in the future, and in the real estate business, if one sees growth in the next five years, they should be pleased. I will bet on the UAE for at least the next 30 years.</p><p><strong>What does Hartland bring to your product portfolio and to Dubai?<br></strong>Hartland is situated in the heart of the city, and it is one of the few communities that has such a prime location. As a developer, we bring years of experience doing huge and luxurious projects. We are real estate developers that know the business inside and out. We have a responsibility to our consumers to create the best projects we can. We make sure every aspect that goes into the creation of the product is the best it can be. Being backward integrated is unique not only in Dubai but in the entire world. We are the only real estate company in the UAE that can boast about such integration. The details of our projects are extremely important; we are focused on precision and perfection, which our clients know and appreciate. At every level, we have a dedication to quality that translates into persistent luxury. There is great luxury in our dedication to details and in our commitment to quality, and this persists throughout every level of our product offering. We have our own engineering and architectural studios, and this allows us to craft every detail with elegance and precision.</p><p><strong>What can you tell us about Sobha's focus on innovation?<br></strong>We have a quality department that focuses on bringing the best techniques and practices to our operations. We never rest on our laurels and never will. With every new building and project, we strive to further optimize and improve our practices. We are always raising the bar for ourselves, which is a truly exciting component of being in this industry.</p><p><strong>How will your new office in London enhance your international brand?<br></strong>It helps us maximize our international branding as well as strengthen our bonds with customers. Many Chinese travelers regularly visit London, and they represent one of the largest blocks of buyers for us. The Chinese economy is strong, and this translates into Chinese consumers with a keen interest in international real estate. Dubai is also a welcoming environment, allowing many different people to enjoy themselves and integrate. There is a strong international thread here that connects people together.</p><p><strong>How do transformation and disruption shape your business?<br></strong>Transformation and disruption are all about creating a product that never compromises on quality. We must always stay on top of cutting-edge developments so that we can deliver the very best the market has to offer. When our customers do not realize the quality of the product we provide, we must educate them. We know what quality and luxury is, and we must educate the market on these issues so they can be informed and so we can drive the market forward. We are in this industry to educate people about how we are changing real estate and offering the finest products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How would you evaluate 2019 for Turkish Airlines in Dubai?<br></strong>Turkish Airlines experienced strong growth throughout 2019. Results demonstrated the continuity in momentum from 2018 and the positive demand environment for Turkish Airlines in the UAE. In terms of numbers, we served a total of 6.78 million passengers in the Middle East in 2019, up by 1.5% YoY. We also expanded our extensive flight network with the introduction of new routes including Sharjah, Marrakesh, Strasbourg, Port Harcourt, Luxor, Bali/Denpasar, Cancún, Rovaniemi, and most recently, Xi'an, our fourth destination in mainland China. While we've been growing our flight network, we have also been busy refining the pre-flight and on-board experience in Dubai and beyond. In 2019, we opened an art exhibition at the Turkish Airlines Business Class Lounge at Istanbul Airport, upgraded the interiors of our 787-9 Dreamliner fleet, and introduced a brand-new uniform designed by Italian haute couturier Ettore Bilotta. We work to provide more opportunities for our passengers to travel between all our destinations, reflected in a 2.3% rise in seat capacity among our Middle Eastern flights in 2018. Overall, we carried a total of 74.3 million passengers globally in 2019.</p><p><strong>What market trends and changes have you noticed in Dubai, and how do they impact the airline industry?<br></strong>A prevalent trend throughout 2019 was the rise of personalization and experiential travel. Expectations around personalization are constantly growing. Most sectors with a digital presence are tailoring products and services to match consumer preferences and tastes. When it comes to impacting the airline industry, customers are looking for ways to personalize their travels, considering all elements that may add to their all-round experience, from booking to journey to the actual days spent at their destination of choice. They give attention to detail and consider everything from ease of booking, experiential suggestions, hotels, airlines, in-flight services, and lounge and airport experiences. At an experiential level, travelers want to travel better and connect with the cultural and human elements of a destination. In Dubai, this means appreciating the old souks, Emirati hospitality, and a myriad of cuisines. Another trend we are witnessing is the increase in micro-trips. More people are opting to take short or weekend trips, which can generate a lot of business for local economies. In Dubai, we have seen the rise of 'staycations' and regional-based travel. Travelers are opting for more curated travel itineraries and shorter timeframes, which has been made possible by more flight options and greater connectivity.</p><p><strong>Which areas show the most potential?<br></strong>By connecting Sharjah to the world, we have secured a new and untapped gateway into the country—one that takes advantage of the Emirate's growing international aviation and travel markets. This is backed by the fact that in 2019, Sharjah Airport handled a total of approximately 10.2 million passengers. We anticipate our recently launched route to Xi'an, China, to do well. We are also confident about the addition of our flights to Rovaniemi and Strasbourg, two destinations which were previously not easily reachable from the Middle East. As the fastest-growing air cargo brand in the world, Turkish Cargo is currently serving 126 countries and showing promising growth. In 2019, we achieved a 7.9% increase in tonnage in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals and objectives for 2020?<br></strong>Our main goal remains the same: enhancing our brand of luxury and offering travelers a more rewarding experience. The opening of the new Istanbul Airport, the introduction of the new destinations, and the addition of new aircraft Dreamliner B787 have provided the basis for an improved Turkish Airlines offering, and we will continue to build on that throughout 2020. We plan to increase our international and regional routes and strengthen our network. We have several exciting developments in the pipeline, including the launch of our A350 aircraft to Dubai and the addition of new destination such as Haneda, Newark, Malabo, and Osaka. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>As the leading authority on strategy and originator of the Industry 4.0 concept, how do you define Industry 4.0 and differentiate it from previous industrial revolutions?<br></strong>Industry 4.0 fuses the digital, the physical, and the virtual world and is the biggest structural change in the past 250 years. The fourth industrial revolution began in Germany at the beginning of the 21st century with the combination of the digital, physical, and virtual worlds into what is called cyber-physical systems. Due to its scale, scope, and complexity, this transformation is and will be unlike anything humankind has experienced. It is disrupting every industry and economy in every country. And it fundamentally alters the way we live, work, consume, trade, invest, and relate to one another. This new paradigm marries advanced production and operations techniques with smart digital technologies to create a digital enterprise that will be not only interconnected and autonomous but can communicate and analyze data to drive further intelligent actions in the physical world. Disruption is not a new phenomenon. It is the accelerating frequency of disruption that poses a new challenge. Furthermore, this new revolution creates waves, each unlocking the paradigm shift of the next wave, and so on, as there are certain technological requisites that enable newer technologies at later stages. Currently, we have entered the second wave, defined by radical changes in the manufacturing industry. It alters the way companies operate and the relationship between suppliers, customers, and third parties, with increased interactions between all parties.</p><p><strong>What differentiates Dubai as the most equipped to lead the world in terms of Industry 4.0?<br></strong>Dubai is at a major crossroad that will define the future of growth, prosperity, productivity, and competition. The UAE, and Dubai in particular, is set to be the leader that will show the world the right road to take. In my experience of dealing with G20 countries' strategies, only the UAE has all factors needed: a willingness to lead, capital, and a government that acts like a private organization through its righteous ruler. Dubai's Industry 4.0 has to be carefully designed; if designed successfully, it can offer a model for the world. It requires that government, financial institutes, and businesses work together in a closed-door room to proactively create it—not buy or react to it. In the last 20 years, the UAE has been built on buying the best of the best. But there must be a fundamental shift marking an era characterized by creating new industries. I am dedicating the next four years of my life to enabling the UAE's lead.</p><p><strong>What are the main drivers for Dubai companies to adopt Industry 4.0?<br></strong>Each industry has different drivers. Nevertheless, there are three common stages of adoption. The first stage of adoption is increased operational excellence. All organizations that want to compete focus on operational excellence. Roughly 70% of organizations' operations pertain to non-core activities such as human resources, finances, and procurement. These are areas wherein Industry 4.0 enables enhanced performance and relevance through automation and integration of IoT, AI, cloud, and advanced analytics. From there, we move to stage two, which is improved growth. A company's core competencies represent about 15%, and this is where Industry 4.0 is applied through smart supply chain management, smart products, integrated ecosystems, smart automation, smart contracts, and so on. This brings us to the third stage, increased competitiveness. In the current age of disruption, it is necessary to rethink core differentiation. Differentiation is what you do every day through repeatable activities to serve customers better than the competition. This is the true competitive advantage and is a difficult discipline to master. It takes months to develop and refine, constituting only 5% of an organization. But this is the area where early adopters apply Industry 4.0 to develop next markets, services, products, or business models such as bioinformatics, nanotechnology, or quantum technology, to name a few.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What differentiates NetApp in terms of products and services?<br></strong>Industry analyst IDC named NetApp as the leader in All-Flash in EMEA, and Gartner has recognized data fabric as a top technology trend in data and analytics. This is not only a strong validation of NetApp's vision, but our innovation and capabilities also help customers better manage their data. Only NetApp can deliver a data fabric with consistent data services for data visibility and insights, data access and control, and data protection and security. We help customers modernize their data center by moving away from mechanical legacy disks to flash, for example. Also, NetApp supports customers that have distributed architectures to build their own private/hybrid cloud and lastly enable them to leverage the power of the hyperscalers by building a hybrid multi-cloud architecture to serve different types of workloads.</p><p><strong>How is data safer with NetApp?<br></strong>The NetApp data fabric provides companies an enterprise data security approach that spans their entire data infrastructure, on and off premise. Additionally, NetApp ONTAP helps build a zero-trust architecture to protect a customer's data across the hybrid cloud. The data is encrypted at the lowest level, whether it is at rest, moving through the network, or stored in the cloud. This helps provisioning of consistent data security policies across flash, disk, and cloud—with visibility into all customers' storage devices. As preserving data integrity is also a major concern while adopting cloud into a business strategy, NetApp created Cloud Secure, which provides total visibility into user access and malicious behavior. This allows detection of possible threats and ensures that proper actions are taken against process-violating behaviors. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the recent legislative updates in Dubai that help enable entrepreneurs and innovation?<br></strong>IP laws were introduced in the UAE for more than a decade, including protection for trademarks, patents, work of authors, and various other laws to protect IP holders. More recently an IP protection law was introduced to DIFC in 2019. The UAE has issued a new Companies Law and a Bankruptcy Law that will likely boost entrepreneurship. The long-awaited Bankruptcy Law comes with a preliminary protection and process to avoid and protect companies from bankruptcy to save companies that may be able to be saved from liquidity issues and court enforcements. Every year, corporate registries in the UAE are offering more competitive setting up and licensing fees and are continually improving the friendliness and speed for setting up in the UAE.</p><p><strong>How do you and the company embody and enhance Dubai's spirit of innovation?<br></strong>We try to foster innovation by bringing minds to work together, in particular when working on solving a problem. We try to make a challenge of everything we do in the office and encourage working groups to meet within the office to think of new ways and ideas to help improve our office. On an ongoing basis, we try to re-think what we do in the office and speak out in a friendly forum of what we would like to see better in the firm. We then take such ideas and compare them against one another and put a group together to implement and make change in the organization. The ongoing nature of having ideas and then comparing them to others provides innovation and gives the people involved experience in dealing with new ideas and learning which ideas work and which do not.</p><p><strong>How do you expect Expo 2020 to impact the entrepreneurial and innovation landscape? <br></strong>Expo 2020 will be a reminder to the country that there is significantly more room for innovation. It will certainly encourage people by seeing the pace of development and innovation in other countries. As a firm, we expect to assist new business or current businesses with new bright ideas and its implementation. We also expect an increase in work to do with the registration of patents and trademarks. There is a growing need as well for protecting authors of art and other productions that we have noticed in recent years, and this trend will continue as more work from authors are produced in this region. There is certainly a high probability that Expo 2020 will encourage more innovation and growth in the business in the region, as people from all over the world exchange ideas and learn new things from one another.</p><p><strong>How does Dubai compare in terms of IP laws and innovation regionally? Are there any places that offer notable competition now or in the near future?</strong><br>Dubai has led the region in innovation. The UAE has as well put in place extremely important IP laws early on to help this growth and protect any innovation and new ideas by any person in the UAE. IP is being protected in the UAE in a noticeable fashion, and regulations are enforced by the authorities diligently. The other seven Emirates, in particular Abu Dhabi, are also enforcing and regulating the IP laws under the same federal law and regulation. Each Emirate certainly can be seen to encourage innovation and new ideas in slightly different but successful ways.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and vision for the firm in 2020 and the coming years?<br></strong>The firm's priorities and vision for 2020 and the coming years is to focus on challenging businesses with new legal ideas to improve the protection that they are afforded by law, assist in concluding successful contracts for clients, and develop a better commercial understanding of the business and priorities of our clients to better serve them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>As the first digital utility with autonomous systems, how does Digital DEWA factor into sustaining DEWA's leading position as an innovative utility ahead of those in Europe and the US?<br></strong>DEWA is disrupting the business model of public utilities, becoming the world's first digital utility to use autonomous systems for renewable energy and storage, while expanding the use of digital services. DEWA's efforts are focused on entering the race for the future by employing the Fourth Industrial Revolution's disruptive technologies such as AI, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), energy storage, blockchain, and the IoT, as well as developing technical infrastructure and state-of-the-art customer centers with advanced solutions. Through Digital DEWA, the digital arm of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, we will disrupt the entire business of public utilities by becoming the world's first digital utility to use autonomous systems for renewable energy and storage. Digital DEWA supports DEWA's strategy for digital transformation to help achieve the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and the directives of His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai, to transform the Dubai government into a fully digital government and the first paperless government by end of 2021. DEWA has taken major steps toward this goal and achieved the best results among government departments that participated in the first stage of the Dubai Paperless Strategy. DEWA has reduced its paper usage by 60%. Currently, 94% of DEWA's customers use its smart services. As a result of these efforts, DEWA ranked first in the Happiness Index in the large Dubai Government Entities category for the second consecutive year with a score of 95% on Smart Dubai's Happiness Index.</p><p><strong>How do Digital DEWA's four main pillars—renewable energy, energy storage, AI, and digital services—complement each other to meet the Emirate's energy-related targets?</strong><br>Digital DEWA has four main pillars to deliver a new utility experience for Dubai and the world. The first pillar is launching advanced solar power technologies in Dubai. The second is deploying a renewable energy grid with innovative energy storage technologies. The third pillar is expanding its use of integrated AI solutions to make Dubai the first city to provide AI-based electricity and water services. The fourth pillar is using connected technologies to provide around-the-clock, world-class services through the MORO data hub that provides advanced and innovative digital solutions and promotes smart city applications.</p><p><strong>As the person in charge of the future of DEWA, what are your strategic priorities and vision for the organization's future as we approach the turn of a decade?</strong><br>For us at DEWA, excellence is a never-ending journey. We work across different sectors and departments to achieve the best results and continuously pursue the highest levels of efficiency by adopting innovative mechanisms that improve the quality of services to make life in Dubai the best in the world. We align our vision to become a globally leading sustainable innovative corporation with the vision of our wise leadership to make Dubai the smartest and happiest city in the world. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is SAP enabling the current shift to the knowledge-based economy?<br></strong>Excitingly, this region has a rather youthful population, and new generations entering the workforce are ready for an economy that is agile and service orientated. Taking a holistic view, we not only bring hard infrastructure like the data center and our solutions, but we have looked to build talent locally and launched a training and development institute. Nearly 1,000 students have graduated from our training and development institute. This has been a huge investment from SAP to ensure that we are creating digital savvy users of the future and equipping them for a new career and new possibilities. Another way in which we upskill human talent is through Next-Gen, our partnership with about 1,600 universities across the globe. Through this program, we bring in SAP into the curriculum to expose students to a wide variety of capabilities, course content, and opportunities, both through SAP and other vocations. Next-Gen creates innovation that is purpose driven and often connected to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, which are well aligned with our purpose as an organization to have a meaningful impact on the societies and the economies in which we operate. The third piece is getting involved in community efforts. There was a program that we called Refugee Code Week, now rebranded as Digital Skills for Today. This program is targeted for people who have limited opportunity to be part of a formal program or be part of a formal university course to empower them with the necessary skills and to democratize coding knowledge.</p><p><strong>In which sectors are you seeing faster adoption and integration of solutions?<br></strong>The paradox of Dubai has been the public sector setting the bar for the private sector. There is perhaps no other market in which this is the case. We have doubled down in terms of what we want to do in the Middle East as a whole, but specifically in Dubai our focus is how we can be a part of the new tapestry of innovation within the public service. We will launch a Leonardo center. Leonardo is the overall description for innovation within SAP. It is inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci and bringing solutions that make the impossible possible. We are doing a fair bit of collaboration with the Minister of AI, also working a lot with Area 71 and pushing Dubai into another stratosphere in terms of transforming the public sector a bastion of citizen and tourist centricity. The public sector for us is a place where we can explore a great deal of how we can build an environment where augmented humanity becomes a prescription rather than a threat.</p><p><strong>What visitor experience is SAP looking to bring to Expo 2020?<br></strong>For us, it is just an immense pleasure to be a partner with Expo along this journey. The aspirations of what Expo will be not only to visitors but what it plans to showcase for the world are topics that are extremely pertinent in today's world. Connecting people and connecting minds are important facets of how we bring the world closer together. SAP is the foundation through which the Expo experience is delivered. Expo has decided to really consolidate on SAP solutions to manage that personal experience, from entering the site, through all the touch points, and exiting Expo, providing a seamless and personal journey. A major part of this is taking care of people of determination and optimizing their experiences. We are looking to build an application with a young start-up for a solution using SAP technology that will make the experience world class and a first ever for people of determination. For example, given mobility is a subtheme of Expo, visitors with limited mobility should be able to reach all four corners of the Expo site. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>When we look at sectors such as logistics, tourism, infrastructure, and air cargo, we understand that the UAE does not just say things, but makes them happen. We did not invent the airplane, maritime trade, or tourism, and did not have any of the fundamental cornerstones that make the UAE a leader in these sectors. But today, because of the vision and drive of our leadership, we were able to become global leaders in each of these sectors. Our strategy revolves around that. It revolves around making the UAE one of the leading countries in AI in the next 10 years. </p><p>We are entering a new decade, that of the digital revolution and AI. The UAE has certain advantages that make it a lot more prone to being a leader in AI than many other countries. We have 200 nationalities living and thriving here, and if you understand anything about AI, you know that AI lives on data. The importance of data has three Vs: volume, velocity, and variety of data. These 200 nationalities give us the variety. We have the most diverse data set on the planet. When it comes to the volume of data, the UAE has platforms that are local but operate globally. Just look at our port's operator, DP World, an operator that came out of the UAE but operates more than 68 ports and terminals around the world. The data center they have is more valuable than any other port's on the planet. The same can be said about Etihad and Emirates Airlines, which operate to more than 166 destinations around the world and are the biggest airlines in the world. These have the most important and unique data set when it comes to air travel. Finally, when we look at velocity, there has been a long transformation process that the UAE has been going through since 2002, which took us from being a traditional government to being an electronic, digital, mobile, and then smart government by 2015. It took many years of planning and implementation to become a leading government of the future. Today, we are ready for this transformation process and can become a cutting-edge country that exports technologies to the rest of the world. <br>The UAE's AI strategy revolves around three main foundations. The first is talent and capacity building. Only by attracting and retaining the right talent from around the world can the UAE become the leading country when it comes to AI. Some of you may ask why this talent would come to the UAE? This is because the UAE offers a unique quality of life. We have the mobility that no one else has. You can be in the UAE and access any market in one day through a direct flight. Also, the UAE offers a legislative process that is very agile and very flexible. So experts from around the world can come and deploy their solutions on the ground in the UAE in the most effective manner. We also believe in the need to create homegrown talent. We have also launched many programs to empower the youth of the UAE to understand AI and how it can give them the ability to understand whether they want to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, or join another sector. <br>The second part of this is the policymaking framework. In most countries, policies are made, and the private sector, academia, and people leading the effort are forced to abide by it. In the UAE, we have more of a consultative approach where we work with the private sector and academia to ensure everyone is happy with the direction we are moving in. Most importantly, then, is the question of responsibly deploying AI in key government sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the mission of DIC, and how has it grown in the last 20 years?<br></strong>DIC was built in 1999 and turned 20 in October 2019. In two decades, DIC has helped transform Dubai into a regional internet and technology hub, attracting tech giants like Google, MasterCard, Microsoft and IBM, and nurturing home-grown start-ups like Careem and Souq. Our mission is to support Dubai as it builds a knowledge-based economy with technology at the heart of it. Through the ecosystem we have developed here, we are helping Dubai become one of the smartest cities in the world.</p><p><strong>How have you built a strategy nimble enough to adapt to changes brought by disruptive technologies?<br></strong>Our strategy has always been to a create a dynamic, flourishing community that enables business growth with state-of-the-art infrastructure, modern buildings, and our in5 Tech innovation center to support start-ups and entrepreneurs. We also look after regulations and red tape to improve the ease of doing business in DIC. We are focused on creating a vibrant ecosystem for technology companies of all sizes and for that we need to remain dynamic and ready to seize new opportunities.</p><p><strong>How do you enable companies in the ecosystem to grow?<br></strong>We enable companies to grow with the right infrastructure, regulations and environment. There are more than 1,600 tech companies employing 25,000 professionals in DIC, and we need to ensure our regulations meet their needs and improve ease of doing business for everyone from start-ups to tech giants. We simplify procedures by providing our business partners with online services to streamline operational requirements, such as visas or trade certificates. We have helped introduce a part-time student permit, which allows students in universities to work in outsourcing companies. It is also important to mention that du, the second communications company in the UAE, was established in DIC and developed to create an infrastructure network in the area. We also continually develop our strategy for building ecosystems. Some 20 years ago, our plan was to attract companies like Microsoft and IBM. It took 10 years to get most of them here, but we succeeded. Now, as an ecosystem, we are developing the next phase of homegrown companies, start-ups, and unicorns.</p><p><strong>What are the challenges regarding human resources?<br></strong>Dubai has always been a magnet for talent, offering an attractive lifestyle that makes it easy to start a business. It is cosmopolitan, and there is little red tape. However, this is not enough; companies need the best talent to be successful. All the big hubs around the world are fighting for the same talent, and in a way, the ecosystems drive each other. Nevertheless, it is not sustainable to only look for talent from abroad. In Dubai, we have an entrepreneurial spirit, and a recent law has been created to let universities allow students to get entrepreneurial licenses. This allows students to start businesses while they are in university and is a great step to encourage entrepreneurialism. Our business partners have a key role to play in training young staff and creating a talent base. We are proud to host them as Dubai enjoys the ripple effects of innovation.</p><p><strong>What are some of DIC's biggest success stories?<br></strong>We are extremely proud of many success stories, such as Careem and Souq. Our ecosystem is a hub not only for larger companies but start-ups as well. Many big tech start-up stories we hear in the region come from DIC—however, there are success stories from TECOM Group's other business parks too. At the end of 2018, there were over 1,600 companies and 33,500 business professionals in DIC. in5, a platform for start-ups and entrepreneurs, has the highest percentage of women, at 17% compared to other locations, with approximately 180 entrepreneurs and 82 new start-ups.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been the immediate impact of the UAE's first human mission into space on the country, and what will be the long-term impacts of building a corps of Emirati astronauts?<br></strong>The launch of the first Emirati astronaut, Hazza Al Mansouri, on a scientific mission to the International Space Station was a landmark moment for the UAE and the Arab world. While Mission One was undoubtedly a dream come true for each one of us, it also strengthened our position in the global space sector. During his time at the Space Station, Al Mansouri communicated with students in the UAE regularly and provided the very-first tour of the station in Arabic. The results of the experiments conducted by Al Mansouri before, during, and after his spaceflight will serve as valuable insights for students, researchers, and scientists in the UAE and across the world. To inspire the youth, Al Mansouri and Sultan Al Neyadi have been visiting schools across the UAE, sharing their experiences with students. The success of the mission will go a long way in inspiring future generations to pursue space science and other STEM-related fields to drive human progress. Mission One was just the start of our long-term goals of supporting the country's vision of creating a knowledge economy while contributing to global scientific efforts for space research and exploration. Just months after the conclusion of Mission One, we started our search for the next batch of Emirati astronauts who will represent our country in future space missions.</p><p><strong>How does the center contribute to creating a culture of innovation and research in the STEM space?<br></strong>One of our key objectives at MBRSC is building the nation's capabilities in space technology and research. Based on our realization that the future of the UAE's space sector depends on the capabilities of our future generations, we have launched a slew of initiatives and programs to engage with students of different age groups and levels. For instance, the Space Explorer Camp, which is part of our Mars 2117 initiative, is a program for young students to learn about the fundamentals of space science and technology. Meanwhile, the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) encourages graduates to contribute to the Emirates Mars Mission (EMM) — Hope Probe, the UAE's first interplanetary mission, which will be launched in July 2020 on its mission to study the Martian atmosphere. Through our programs and space missions, we are creating an ecosystem for innovation and R&amp;D in the UAE. While we are a young organization, we have grown quickly, and with each project, we have built new capabilities.</p><p><strong>How do you see EMM helping build national capabilities in the fields of space sciences and R&amp;D?<br></strong>The relevance of any space mission transcends its scientific objectives. Its impact on human capital ripples through future generations. EMM — Hope Probe, even before its launch, has helped us build our knowledge base and our capabilities in interplanetary space exploration. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum once said, “The Emirates Mars Mission will be a great contribution to human knowledge, a milestone for Arab civilization, and a real investment for future generations." Exemplifying the vision of our great leaders, in the past five years, over 100 Emirati engineers, scientists, researchers, and administrators have gained a deep understanding of building a spacecraft that can reach Mars. A team of Emirati analysts are studying existing data from other missions to develop their capabilities so that when the probe starts sending data, our team is ready to analyze it and turn it into valuable insights that can be shared with the global scientific community. The data that we receive from the Hope Probe once it reaches the Martian orbit will provide the first comprehensive picture of the planet, which will benefit generations of scientists and explorers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main drivers of Smartworld within the ICT sector?<br></strong>At Smartworld, we take three things seriously. First is customer centricity; achieving customer satisfaction is our priority. We have designed agile approaches to help deliver better customer service. Second is cost optimization—we continuously pinpoint our resources and sharpen our operational capabilities in a way that enables us to offer cost-effective services and solutions. Third is innovation—the only way to balance the two previous drivers is to create a bridge of innovation. Marketplaces are becoming highly competitive. Our employees are our most vital asset in generating innovative ideas, which is why we have implemented the smart idea platform to internally capture ideas and suggestions.</p><p><strong>Are there other advantages to 5G beyond speed?<br></strong>The essential component is the speed at which data can be transferred. The technology promises to change our lives by connecting everything around us to a network that is 100 times faster. Today, drone technology has made huge strides, and 5G will unlock more of its capabilities. The network will allow for precise control of the drone, while sending back high-definition video. Before, the concept of security was always conceptualized in a two-dimensional way. Yet today, security is becoming increasingly three-dimensional with drones. This is the reason why we have invested in anti-drone technology to ensure that spaces can be secured. This is essential for areas like an airport where a drone issue can disrupt the operations. Every minute that an airport halts operation has immense costs. Technology is both a best friend to people and their biggest threat.</p><p><strong>What is the significance for Smartworld of working with Cisco for Expo's network infrastructure?<br></strong>It is a huge opportunity and honor for us to be part of the most iconic project in the UAE, and Smartworld is committed to helping Expo 2020 team deliver a global event enabled by the latest technology. Our team's expertise and past engagement in different complex projects helped us win Expo 2020 projects. Currently, Smartworld is working with Cisco to deploy parts of Expo's digital IP network infrastructure, including Cisco intent-based networking solutions, which support the digital experience offered at Expo 2020, helping visitors, participants, and businesses connect from anywhere on the 4.38-sqkm site, on any device, securely, reliably, and seamlessly. The network is also designed to support over 100,000 IoT devices during Expo. Smartworld will also implement ICT, security, and audiovisual systems in Expo 2020's sustainability pavilion. The pavilion is one of three at the expo, presenting the opportunity to deliver an aspirational message about the natural world, ecology, and technology to a global audience.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals moving forward?<br></strong>For us, it is not just about generating revenue. We are also interested in creating initiatives that can be sustainable and reliably counted on to give back to society. We have taken this mandate and focused on taking them into greater heights. As an example, in 2016 Smartworld launched CIOMajlis, a thought leadership platform and networking hub for senior technology executives to share experience, enhance knowledge, and explore business solutions. CIOMajlis performs six major initiatives. Every month, CIOMajlis organizes a roundtable on a specific topic related to the latest technology trends. More than 35 topics have been discussed, from blockchain, AI, and digital transformation to robotics, the future of governments, and so on. CIOMajlis also organizes site visits to explore how technology enables the development of organizations. Every year, CIOMajlis organizes a one-week innovation tour to one of the most innovative countries in the world in order to help CIOs spark innovation and build a strategic vision on the impact of disruptive technologies and emerging trends. It also launched the Future CIO Award to promote innovation in the field of IT. CIOMajlis also conducts benchmarking studies of IT services. Lastly, every year, CIOMajlis organizes an annual conference to give its members an opportunity to share case studies and success stories with their peers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Dubai has become the model for others to emulate. How are you collaborating across borders to bring the lessons Dubai has learned to other places?<br></strong>Smart Dubai was launched as a truly citizen-centric smart city initiative with an aim of leveraging the power of technology to make everyday life easier, seamless, and efficient for all residents and visitors, eventually making Dubai the happiest city on earth. We are developing and implementing use cases around different emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI and leveraging data science capabilities to redefine the delivery of city experiences for all. We are consistently approached by several country and city governments to share our learnings on smart city development, which is why we continuously share our experience through participation in global events. We also regularly contribute to several policymaking and research reports created by the UN and the World Economic Forum. Finally, in April 2018 we also launched the Smart City Global Network, which brings together smart city leaders, technology experts, and academics on one platform to share knowledge and experiences with each other.</p><p><strong>What were some of the main takeaways from the UAE's ï¬rst forum on Happy Cities, and what are the next steps in terms of the happiness agenda?</strong><br>The first Happy Cities Forum brought together government, semi-government, and private sector entities to showcase and exchange best practices that considered citizen-centric design and use of technology to deliver happier services to the residents and visitors of Dubai. Along with the government, the private sector plays a key role in defining and designing daily experiences for the city's residents and visitors, and thus the Happy Cities Forum helped to build stronger partnerships and collaborations between government and private-sector entities. As part of our work on the Happiness Agenda over the past three years, Smart Dubai has been organizing the Designing Cities Program annually, a learning expedition for the Happiness Champions of Dubai, who leading the implementation of the Happiness Agenda city-wide. As of December 2019, the Happiness Champions have been given two new titles: Smart City Experience Specialist for a champion working in customer-oriented services and Work Environment Specialist, for a champion working in HR-oriented roles. The new titles will help them further specialize and focus their efforts, ultimately embedding the concept of Smart Happiness in their organizations.</p><p><strong>How is Smart Dubai Department ensuring that the start-up ecosystem grows in breadth and depth?<br></strong>Smart Dubai also runs or participates in several accelerators and challenges organized to help foster the start-up and SME community in Dubai. We are part of the Dubai Future Accelerators, Dubai Chamber's Smartpreneur challenge, and Startupbootcamp's Smart City Dubai Accelerator. Also, we annually run the Smart Dubai Blockchain Challenge inviting start-ups from around the world to pitch their blockchain implementation ideas at the Future Blockchain Summit, the largest blockchain summit held in the world, attracting over 9,000 visitors in 2019. The Smart Dubai Blockchain Challenge received over 700 applications from 79 countries in 2019.</p><p><strong>How does Smart Dubai Department function as the cornerstone of public and private collaboration for Dubai's digital transformation?</strong><br>Smart Dubai leads the collaboration between the Dubai government and private-sector entities in several ways. One is policymaking, where we have taken a collaborative approach toward building policies and legislations for emerging technology use in Dubai. Be it the Dubai Data Policies, the Dubai Blockchain Policy, or the Dubai Ethical AI Principles and Guidelines—all were created with the support of local and international partners from the government and private sector. In terms of PPPs, Dubai Pulse, which is known as the digital backbone of Dubai, hosting over 530 Dubai government data sets and providing several other services is a product of partnership between Smart Dubai and local telecoms operator du. Another example is the Dubai Blockchain Platform, which is fully funded by IBM but supported by Smart Dubai. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does your new auction facility mean for the growth of diamonds and gemstones as a commodity in Dubai?<br></strong>This coincides with The Financial Times fDi Magazine naming DMCC as the Global Free Zone of the Year for the fifth consecutive year. We never expect these awards, but we do work to make sure that we set expectations and standards for such a title extremely high. The World Federation of Diamond Bourses also has high standards to protect their image and the diamond industry. The business case and reputation of a location are major considerations for approving a diamond exchange in any given city. No one expected us to attract merchants and become one of the top rough diamond centers in the world. In many ways, this underdog perception worked to our advantage. All the major associations were friendly because they did not expect us to be so influential. Our other main advantages are access to the Gulf and the international composition of Dubai. We became a member of the World Federation of Diamond Bourses in 2003, and now we have the largest trading floor in the world. We receive 80-90% of Angolan rough diamonds. With our upgraded and redesigned auction facility and investment in technology, Dubai could become the largest diamond center in the world in three to five years.</p><p><strong>How do you maintain trust and consistency in the market to become the number-one diamond center in the world?<br></strong>What we have done took 19 years of hard work. Businesses have made decisions to work with us based on years of trust. At the end of 2017, I pushed against the VAT. I am not against taxing, but I am against taxing some things. Because of the tax, we lost some business in 2018. Many people, however, do not take these issues personally. I am working with banks and ministers to create the necessary environment for DMCC and the diamond exchange to thrive. Dubai is a market to be reckoned with because it is agile; if there is an issue, it is resolved quickly and in an innovative manner. In a way, it is a reminder to the world of Dubai's responsiveness, giving people more reasons to come to the Emirate. Even after 17 years, we are bringing in new businesses. Our plan is to attract major players operating in the diamond industry across Africa.</p><p><strong>What are DMCC's expansion plans?<br></strong>Our Uptown Dubai District will increase the appeal of Dubai. At the heart of this new district is the Jumeirah Lakes Towers (JLT), particularly the Uptown Tower, an exciting, tall addition to Dubai's skyline. Important features of this world-class business hub include a LEED Gold Certification and vibrant community atmosphere with multi-use event areas and lifestyle amenities. We are looking at unique ways of developing it and bringing in strategic partners. The majority of JLT is ready, except for the area dedicated to this expansion. And we have an exceptional opportunity to develop this space with the Expo coming up. People from around the world will bring companies and services to the Expo to impress the world, so this will be the best opportunity for us to introduce our services. We want to enhance collaborations between ourselves and other businesses, much like we do during our travels. We are known for gold and diamonds and increasingly for tea and coffee, and we are the number-one exchange in terms of the number of oil and gas companies. There are over 2,000 companies here, and more are joining on a regular basis. The way we do business is changing fast because of disruptions and technologies, and I want to make sure DMCC is moving faster to integrate these changes and evolve. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you outline the role of Customs World and Dutech within the Ports, Customs, and Free Zone Corporation (PCFC)?</strong>Both Customs World and Dutech fall under the PCFC. Customs World is the consultancy arm of PCFC involved in providing various services related to customs modernization programs and unique solution provisioning that meet the current and future needs of governments in their drive to secure borders and facilitate trade. Dutech is the IT business partner of the corporation and its sister entities. The two entities encourage investment through the facilitation of trade by removing unnecessary trade barriers while protecting the borders against compliance risks. In relation to facilitating the flow of trade, we have embarked on a new initiative called the World Logistics Passport (WLP) with the help of Dubai Customs, DP World, dnata, Emirates Group, Dubai Trade, and Road and Transport Authority (RTA). We are focusing on making Dubai a mega hub that links the East to Africa and Central and South America. Our goal is to achieve the efficient movement of goods across borders in order to improve the performance, productivity, and proficiency of our business community.</p><p><strong>What does RIISE mean for Customs World and its portfolio?<br></strong>RIISE is a result of years of international and regional experience in best customs practices that was used to create a unique and one-of-a-kind new generation of solutions that are ahead of all others in terms of capability and agility. It stands for revenue, intelligence, innovation, security, and economy. Our main goal is to assist nations with modernizing their customs and border processing systems by incorporating machine-learning capabilities and predictive analytics into their core business practices. RIISE can be used private companies to interact with government agencies and by private warehousing companies to organize their interactions. Aside from its customs management capabilities, RIISE has a more futuristic feature, which removes barriers of trade by minimizing cumbersome bureaucracy. We bridge strategic and operational perspectives for customs modernization and trade facilitation with solutions that increase the level of transparency and integrity and help reduce or eliminate corrupt practices. This innovative tool helps us navigate unchartered waters and gives us the courage to take the extra step.</p><p><strong>How can your innovative customs solutions help advance developed markets?<br></strong>Customs authorities often fail to adopt disruptive techniques and advanced technologies. This is why there is a need to reinvent and restructure the existing operating model of business and customs processing and reinvent the way trade is done with the introduction of virtual, data, and process-driven solutions. With that in mind, we built RIISE as a trade facilitation platform that is unique and futuristic and involves all stakeholders to offer a smart, intelligent, integrated, and complete end-to-end solution for trade flow. With the World Logistics Passport (WLP), a new and innovative model of trade facilitation is being developed using RIISE as a platform to serve authorities, strategic operators, and trade communities. Using RIISE, strategic players in the supply chain such as DP World and Emirates Group can secure trusted green corridors for their trusted clients, increase efficiency, reduce costs, and build stronger relations with their clients. Authorities that adopt and facilitate the WLP and RIISE platform will be the biggest winners, as these tools will enable them to achieve their strategic objectives and secure trade routes.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for 2020?<br></strong>Capitalizing on Dubai's capabilities and reaffirming its position on the global stage are our priorities, given that we are in a fierce competition with regional and global competitors. We are now preparing ourselves for another leap forward, and RIISE will be a valuable platform for accomplishing this along with the support of the government, cutting-edge technologies, operators such as Emirates and DP World, and trust of the trade community. We are also looking to change the existing operating model to bring in innovative ways of doing trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you elaborate on Dubai Customs' smart government initiatives and other innovative capacities? <br></strong>Dubai Customs recently won the innovation platinum award with a six-star rating from EFQM Global Excellence Award, scoring 700 points out of 1,000, the highest among all participating organizations. With this exceptional achievement, Dubai Customs has become the first organization in the world to win this reputable global award based on the new rating system in 2019. Winning the EFQM award is an international recognition of our leading achievements and the advanced level we have reached in customs innovation. The objective of the EFQM Excellence Award Program is to recognize role model organizations around the world. The program has one of the most challenging assessment processes. As a role model organization, we have invested in innovation in order to develop and upgrade customs procedures to introduce the best services and trade facilities. As a leading government department, Dubai Customs has introduced different development programs and innovative systems that help maintain its leading position in the Emirate. These include the Smart Risk Engine, Mirsal, and the Authorized Economic Operator. We recently launched the second phase of the productivity engine, which showed positive results across multiple indicators. The engine, developed in-house by Dubai Customs, uses AI to boost productivity, reduce costs, and ensure customer satisfaction. We are targeting 8% to 10% increase in productivity over the next 12 months. We have certain targets that we look forward to, which include reducing workload by 16.8%, increasing productivity by 35.5%, and boosting employee commitment by 5.2%. This will save us around 1.3 million work hours.</p><p><strong>How do you assess Dubai Customs' role in enabling trade and maintaining Dubai's position as a global trade hub? <br></strong>Indicators for 1H2019 showed that Dubai's external non-oil trade grew 31% YoY. In terms of value, external trade rose 5% YoY to AED676 billion from AED644 billion. Notably, between 2009 and 2019, external trade has made a stunning 87% growth. These results reflect Dubai's robustness in turning challenges that face global trade into opportunities and achievements and its ability to attract investments from around the world. Exports made the biggest growth in 1H2019 with 46% in weight to reach 10 million tons and 17% in value to AED76 billion. Re-exports grew 39% to 9 million tons and rose in value 3% to AED210 billion. Imports also grew in weight 26% to reach 38 billion tons and in value by 4% to AED390 billion. The prospective for trade activity in our region is positive, and we are optimistic about the future, especially with the advent of Expo 2020 and the UAE's strategy for the next 50 years.</p><p><strong>Can you comment on Dubai Customs' global prominence amongst customs organizations? <br></strong>Hosting the fifth WCO Global AEO Conference in March 2020, in cooperation with the Federal Customs Authority, is an indication of the world's confidence in the potential and capabilities of Dubai Customs. Through its publications, the World Customs Organization has repeatedly highlighted the advanced procedures and practices followed by Dubai Customs. This included a report titled "Dubai Customs' journey into the future of customs," which focuses on development programs and a number of articles on the Virtual Corridor initiative, the Authorized Economic Operator, the iDeclare application, and the Virtual Training program. Hosting the conference is part of Dubai's efforts in maintaining its leading position as trade hub.</p><p><strong>How will Expo 2020 impact the economy, and what is Dubai Customs' involvement in the event? <br></strong>Dubai Customs has dedicated a customs clearance channel, named Expo 2020 Smart Customs Channel, through which it will deliver preferential services to Expo 2020 participants and exhibitors. Shipments will be cleared in record time to enable exhibitors to effectively take part in the grand event. Expo 2020 will have a positive impact on the national economy and the development of the tourism, aviation, retail, and shipping sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Dubai maintaining its position as the regional hub?<br></strong>Being a trading hub for the cargo business is something that every country wants, and there is legitimate competition in the region in the shape of Oman and Abu Dhabi. However, Dubai has the advantage of being the first mover in the region. Jebel Ali handles more containers than India. Combining import and transshipment figures, Jebel Ali handles 15 million containers annually. This shows the magnitude of Dubai. A lot of neighboring countries are trying to mimic Dubai's concept; however, a hub is not created overnight. Being a hub requires a cohesive ecosystem. We have gone through the learning curve and have this competitive edge. As a result, more companies and regional heads of companies are coming to Dubai. We will continue to give more opportunities to these players to make it more difficult for any competitors to catch up. DP World's chairman wants Dubai to be 15-20 years ahead, so there is a group-wide focus on this. Technology is a major component of this. Dubai Trade was launched in 2003 as an online cargo clearance platform. Building on the success of Dubai Trade at Jebel Ali, we want to take this concept worldwide. Dubai Trade is still serving Dubai and Jebel Ali, but we created an international brand called DT World. We have done digital solutions for cargo clearance across the world, largely through DP World's global portfolio of ports, free zones, and logistics parks. Our role is to implement digital solutions to complement the top-notch hard infrastructure with innovative soft infrastructure. This digital aspect of DP World will streamline and power cargo movement across the globe and make Dubai stronger. Nowadays, data is the key to doing business. DP World is one of the most active port operators; we are an effective trade enabler facilitating business across supply chains. That is what will make Jebel Ali more competitive; the whole new vision of DP World is to maximize the utilization of ports and hard infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Active in various markets of different levels of technological sophistication, how is the DT World solution suitable for all?<br></strong>80% of the business of cargo movement is the same all over the world. For example, looking at customs declaration, the types of contracts and incoterms of business between the buyer and the importer or exporter are internationally agreed upon. Language is one thing that varies from region to region, and our solution is language agnostic. The remaining 20% is about the peculiarity of each region or market, and we customize our solution to adapt accordingly. Our biggest competitive advantage is not the IT part but the trade business process domain expertise. We are a business innovation company propelling digital transformation. We create and provide solutions to help businesses deliver better productivity, increase efficiency, reach new markets, and increase revenue.</p><p><strong>How is DT World leveraging on the opportunities created by Expo 2020?<br></strong>We are working with the Expo directly. We are doing a project for pavilion owners to bring their goods from all over the world and creating streamlined processes for them. We have over 20 free zones in Dubai so the story of Dubai will continue through the legacy of Expo 2020.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for Dubai Trade and DT World?<br></strong>In terms of ocean freight, there are many fragmented systems that are not well integrated. Our challenge is to make it more streamlined. Our vision is to become the platform of choice that digitally integrates stakeholders and facilitates cargo movement at every step of the process. Infused in this integrated process will be trust, transparency, and scalability. Moreover, we seek to bridge gaps in trade finance and insurance by introducing innovative digital solutions. We are entrepreneurial, open minded, and determined to create solutions and solve pain points for success. Much like Uber, we will tap into convenience and transparency to fill the many gaps in the import-export business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Enabling smarter trade is the essence of what we do. and we use technology and innovation to do this. Technology can often be disruptive, especially when it brings transformative change to the way you work and live. At Jebel Ali Port and Jebel Ali Free Zone (Jafza), you will find technology everywhere. Blockchain, AI, big data, robotics, simulators, and IoT are enabling our logistics and supply chain efficiencies to keep us in the lead position. From the moment a container box arrives on board a ship to its exit from the port's gates, technology has added transparency, speed, and efficiency to our business. DP World is partnering with Oracle to drive digital transformation across its global portfolio. Cloud applications are helping us create new services and support diversification, adding value for all our stakeholders. Our vision is to become a digitalized trade enabler. The new BoxBay high bay storage system, which is under construction at Jebel Ali Port's Container Terminal 4 (T4), is an automated multi-tier container stacking system that will enable the port to handle the same number of containers as a conventional terminal while using a third of the space. DP World — UAE Region has developed and implemented various projects since 2018 to improve productivity and to conduct operations at the utmost efficiency levels. These initiatives include vehicle booking system (VBS), a smart truck appointment system to control the traffic to and from our terminals, an automated system of 60 rail mounted gantry (RMG) cranes, and the expansion of port-side reefer hub facilities to meet the rising traffic of refrigerated containers. Dubai Trade's one-stop electronic trade portal is another example that offers integrated electronic services to trade and logistics service providers under a single window. We are creating an eco-system for logistics and supply-chain operators with an aim to reduce the costs of logistics and make trade more efficient.</p><p><strong>How do you assess DP World — UAE Region's impact on Dubai? <br></strong>Trade has been the most consistent and successful frontline driver of Dubai's economy. DP World's growth strategy and policies are closely aligned with Dubai Plan 2021 and Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030. We represented 33.4% of Dubai's GDP in 2017. DP World — UAE Region accounted for 16.2% of Dubai's total workforce with over 450,000 working across our facilities in the UAE. We believe in pursuing growth in a sustainable manner. As the premier global trade partner of Expo 2020, Jebel Ali Port has been the gateway hub for all Expo-related cargo. Maritime trade will continue to be fueled by such growth plans in the coming years. As the world's largest man-made harbor, Jebel Ali Port has been setting new benchmarks as a container port and a commercial gateway for a region stretching from the Indian subcontinent to East Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. The business model created by Jebel Ali Port as an integrated port and logistics hub is being replicated today across DP World's global portfolio and emulated elsewhere by emerging economies. It has been DP World's foremost contribution to Dubai and its impact will continue to shape and grow the economy of Dubai and the UAE.</p><p><strong>How will you leverage the opportunities created by Expo 2020? <br></strong>DP World's role is to ensure the smooth and steady flow of everything the Expo needs. We play a leading role in enabling the efficient operation of the logistics and supply chain requirements of the event. We are responsible for ensuring all Expo-related cargo brought into Dubai are handled safely and in a timely manner. As part of our overarching engagement, our role as trade enablers will be showcased at the DP World Pavilion, one of the largest at the Expo. The pavilion, centered around the concept of 'Making Trade Flow,' is being developed in line with Expo 2020's sub-themes of opportunity, mobility, and sustainability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the key initiatives you would like to highlight as examples of DP World's disruptive innovation strategy to stay ahead of the curve as we move into the era of smart trade?<br></strong>As a progressive end-to-end logistics solutions provider, we continue to invest in new technologies and disruptive innovation, always seeking the edge that will help us lead the future of world trade through innovative trade solutions. We enable trade around the world, creating and embracing the latest technologies and innovations. For ports and logistics operators like us, the key is to further maximize efficiency, making sure innovations coming on stream can lower costs, increase productivity, and move goods arriving in vast quantities from enormous ocean carriers quicker and more cost-effectively than before. We believe that to stay ahead of the curve, we should constantly upgrade our systems, as the internet and technology have revolutionized the way we do business. Our vision at DP World is global; foreseeing change, thinking about future opportunities, enhancing efficiencies, and adopting innovative and creative trade solutions. In an age of unparalleled change, transforming the way goods are transported is being explored across the world. Moving containers in different ways both by sea and across land has exciting potential. One of our innovations is the world's first high bay storage system, BOXBAY, which we have developed with industrial engineering specialist SMS Group. The first BOXBAY facility is being built at Jebel Ali Terminal 4 in time for the Dubai Expo 2020. The patented design and rack structure of the BOXBAY system creates unique advantages. Containers can be stored eleven stories high, dramatically increasing capacity, and its fully automated system can move every single container individually. This has the potential to revolutionize cargo handling operations because the current system of stacking containers on top of each other means containers must be moved to access containers at the bottom of the stack. We are excited by the prospects for BOXBAY as handling speed and efficiencies are key aspects of the ports and terminals business, and this system is a major development for the sector. We also have a multi-million-dollar investment in US-based Hyperloop One to provide funds for the continued R&amp;D of Hyperloop technology. The Hyperloop system moves magnetically levitating pods through low air pressure tubes. It has the potential to move cargo at the speed of a plane but the cost of a truck. As part of the investment, Hyperloop One will benefit from DP World's expertise in complex cargo handling operations and the experience DP World has accumulated across its global portfolio of more than 150 operations in over 50 countries across six continents. Disruptive innovation is a continuous process, and we continue to unveil new technologies and innovations that facilitate trade and make trading smarter.</p><p><strong>What is the significance of DP World's disruption-driven mission for the future of trade, and how will these innovations impact supply chains and trade?</strong><br>These innovations are shaping the future of trade. Over the last few years, DP World has undertaken a diversification strategy that has transformed it into a global trade enabler by extending its core business of port operations to play a wider role in the supply chain. We have acquired differentiated assets, such as trains, warehousing, and inland logistics in India, and feeder shipping operations in Europe and Asia, as well as formed joint ventures with logistics software and distribution companies in Australia. Our goal is to transform the efficiency of supply chains to benefit cargo owners. Key to the DP World's strategy is digital transformation as we look to provide and develop technology to remove inefficiencies.</p><p><strong>DP World is an official premier partner of Expo 2020. With more than 25 million visitors expected to attend the world's greatest expo, how will DP World's Expo 2020 pavilion convey to the world the seemingly obscure links between the world of cargo and our daily life</strong>?<br>DP World being the premier global trade partner of Expo 2020 means everything related to the Expo flows into Dubai through our globe-spanning logistics network. This includes the utilization of all our ports and terminals, free zones, and maritime services. The Al Wasl dome, which will be the centerpiece of the Expo 2020 site, is a good example of the role we are playing in making Expo happen. Weighing 2,265 tons with an enclosed space of 724,000 cbm, the sections of the dome entered Dubai thanks to Jebel Ali Port's outstanding cargo handling capabilities. The biggest piece—the dome's steel crown—alone weighs 550 tons. Expo 2020 is a unique experience for us. We are often at major events, but the key difference here is one of scale. The Expo site will be the size of a small city, and the event will last for six months. The objective of DP World's Expo 2020 pavilion is to open the eyes of visitors to the world of logistics and supply chains. Most people rarely consider what it takes to transport everything from far off places. How this process works is as complex as it is interesting. Through the use of cutting-edge technologies including augmented and virtual reality, visitors will be able to see the real-time movement of cargo across the world and learn how global trade happens and how it impacts every aspect of everyone's daily life. Trade is an area that, despite its importance, is not understood very well by the general public, and we hope to change that.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and vision for DP World as we look beyond 2020?<br></strong>Our vision is to shape the future of global trade for the better. Our priority is to continue to enhance our capability to offer supply chain logistics to cargo owners, from the point of origin to the point of consumption. We believe there are many opportunities to increase the efficiency of supply chains. Key to our success is the services we offer, which are backed by our global-spanning network of ports and other assets. We will continue to work to create trade corridors around the world. In Africa, for example, we are connecting landlocked countries to the global trading network. In India we are further enhancing our inland logistics operations. In the next decade, DP World will continue to be at the forefront of technological development. The potential of innovations like BOXBAY and Hyperloop is huge. The digital solutions we are developing will transform supply chains, giving more visibility, transparency, and flexibility to cargo owners, enabling them to run their businesses more efficiently. Logistics needs to innovate to keep up with the demands and expectations of a world that has become used to the convenience of e-commerce. Global trade has lifted large parts of the world out of poverty; it has brought prosperity to many developing economies and given hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people access to jobs, better education, and healthcare. At DP World, we will continue to work to make trade smarter and create a better future for all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does DP World's acquisition of Topaz Energy &amp; Marine, now P&amp;O Maritime Logistics, contribute to the group's portfolio?<br></strong>DP World's portfolio included marine services, but recently this segment has received more focus and investment as part of a deliberate strategy. As a result of this investment, this expansion will further its diversification as a global leader in logistics. Topaz was one of the world's leading offshore logistics companies, serving largely the hydrocarbon and renewable energy segments. From Topaz's beginnings in from the Middle East, we have grown into one of the most diversified offshore marine logistics companies. Having outgrown our previous capital structure, DP World took the opportunity to leverage on our scale and expertise to grow their maritime logistics segment, particularly in energy services, and become a major global player in offshore marine logistics space. We have three specific focus areas: logistics, which is everything related to providing energy companies with integrated offshore logistics solutions; offshore, which includes our vessels servicing renewables as well as traditional hydrocarbons; and port services as they pertain to any port in the world, not necessarily a DP World-operated port. More broadly, our true value proposition is our superior positioning to offer our customers a wide portfolio of value-added marine services and integrate these offerings. What's more, we provide these services with safety and the environment amongst our top priorities. Operating as one company under the name P&amp;O Maritime Logistics, we bring together the best from both Topaz and P&amp;O Maritime. This allows us to provide highly demanded cost-effective and diverse solutions to a range of customers who are increasingly looking for a handful of select, trusted suppliers.</p><p><strong>How will innovation drive that strategy forward? <br></strong>Disruption is one of the five pillars of our strategy, and we continue to challenge the status quo and innovate. Currently, we are digitalizing our ships through onboard IoT to measure a ship's health in real time and manage fleet maintenance effectively. Moreover, we will soon have the capability, using our proprietary software, of providing our customers with a dashboard to monitor the status of our services in real time. This is only the beginning; we look forward to further enhancing our utilization and integration of IoT and advanced data analytics. It is with this disruption mindset that we are digitalizing our entire fleet both to reduce costs and increase revenue—ensuring we surpass the standards of a true 21st-century company.</p><p><strong>How are discussions around sustainability impacting your operations?<br></strong>We conduct fascinating discussions surrounding all aspects of energy, though particularly energy diversification, and how it relates to the industry's sustainability. There is no growth without energy, and as a company, industry and country, we most certainly need the right energy mix. At the recent World Energy Congress in Abu Dhabi, we emphasized the necessity of intelligent conversations about this topic. One of the most important conversations is dispelling the myth that all hydrocarbons are causing more damage than good; it is significant to note that the hydrocarbon industry has evolved in the way it finds, extracts, and produces oil. Both Dubai and Abu Dhabi are leading the development of new and sustainable ways of producing energy. Along with its huge technological and entrepreneurial advantages, Dubai also has a proven ability to scale solutions.</p><p><strong>Are there any specific markets where you are looking to bring innovative solutions? <br></strong>Within the region, we see growth opportunities particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Additionally, there is potential in West Africa, such as Angola, the gulf of Benin range, and Senegal. Looking across the Atlantic, South America is a frontier for us as well. These markets will complement our strong presence in Europe and the Caspian Basin. No doubt, we can double our services in the coming five years, and we are merely scratching the surface of transforming shipping through digitalization. While we as a company are quite far ahead of many of our competitors, as an industry we need to catch up. 6<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are DDW's expansion plans, and how do they align with DP World's growth strategy?<br></strong><span></span>We are focused on our customer value proposition: to deliver customized innovation and operational efficiency that enhances our clients' business and meets their specific objectives. In order to make our product and service offering more efficient and effective, DMC was merged with DP World UAE, with the exception of the shipyard and repair services department. The maritime services division of DP World is led by P&amp;O Maritime, a premier maritime solutions provider to governments, businesses, and organizations across seven continents. Innovation is pivotal to the group's growth strategy. We provide a one-stop solution for all new build, conversion, repair, and upgrade requirements. We keep trade flowing with maritime services.</p><p><strong>In what ways does sustainability factor into DDW's operations?<br></strong>DDW has a diverse service offering for the marine, oil and gas, and renewable industries. This diversification helps us be sustainable and better react to market's requirements. Global growth in offshore wind energy will continue to accelerate. As the offshore renewable market expands, technological advancement and innovation will result in continuous improvements and investments in the sector. DDW is a specialist in constructing large-scale renewable offshore projects, and a big achievement for the yard was completing the Borwin Gamma high-voltage direct current (HVDC) Platform topside for Petrofac, Siemens, and Tennet in 2018. This 900-MW platform can transmit enough electricity to power 1 million households. Borwin Gamma took over 13.5 million working-hours to construct and the project, and DDW set a record for completing the heaviest load-out in the UAE on the 21,000-ton structure. The yard also previously built DolWin Beta, the world's largest high-voltage alternating current platform. Also, we recently began work on a 700-MW HVAC transformer station topside, named Hollandse Kust Zuid Alpha, the first of its kind to be constructed in the Middle East.</p><p><strong>What role does technology and innovation play at DDW?<br></strong>Digital disruption permeates the service offering of companies, including their operations and maintenance. From customer dashboards providing real-time operations insight to using data for vessel optimization or yard enhancements, we see IT as a driver of both the topline growth and cost reductions. Our IT systems are being updated to enhance our operations and enable clients to track progress in the yard. Continuous efforts to upgrade and innovate processes and machinery at our facility enable us to stay ahead of the competition. For example, the Robotic Profiling Machine RPC1200S was introduced to the yard in 2019. By incorporating new emerging technologies and meeting our digitalization goals, we will achieve our ambition of remaining competitive and preserving the UAE's global reputation as a maritime destination of choice.</p><p><strong>How is technology facilitating and enhancing synergies across business lines?<br></strong>Dubai hosts the largest single-company operated port in the world, and all the vessels require maintenance and refits that can be provided within the group. Our yard benefits from this demand. We assess opportunities across all teams and decide where certain opportunities fit best from both an execution and strategic perspective. DDW is constructing the first IMO Tier-III-compliant tug in the Mediterranean for P&amp;O Reyser in the Port of Barcelona. Together, DDW and P&amp;O Reyser are building on synergies, with environmental conservation and safety at the forefront. We have a large network of stakeholders, vendors, and subcontractors that support each business line in the maritime services division.</p><p><strong>How is innovation changing the human capital and expertise needed by the industry?<br></strong>Improvements in the skill composition of our workforce is important for the yard's productivity and growth. We are training and hiring a multi-skilled workforce that can deliver innovative solutions to meet all client requirements. We are committed to developing our people as they are our most valuable asset and bring our projects to life. We promote a culture of zero harm to prioritize the integrity of our workforce, assets, and the environment. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How do you assess HTMC's progress thus far in establishing itself as a global center for halal trade?<br></strong>HTMC is a one-stop shop with a focus on providing marketing intelligence, halal compliance, and growth support services to the industry, which includes manufacturers, suppliers, distributors and retailers of halal economy products and services. HTMC offers interested parties tailor-made services by utilizing service partners that provide the center with a range of premium services to support companies and businessmen on local, regional, and global levels. HTMC has more than 18 service partners from different sectors and countries that include trade promotion agencies, halal accreditation bodies, specialist research advisory firms, training partners, local and international public institutions, and Islamic banks, amongst others. HTMC is receiving global traction, actively hosting international business delegations from different countries such as China, Indonesia, and Spain, among others. As a part of our global outreach program, we have participated in international trade missions to Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Russia, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, engaging with halal industry players as well as contributing thought leadership in forums related to the Islamic economy. The center is performing and progressing extremely well and has already achieved its targeted goals in line with its mandate. There will be further efforts made to promote and develop HTMC in 2020.</p><p><strong>Are there specific markets that you are targeting more than others or from which you are receiving increased interest?<br></strong>HTMC is focused on capitalizing economic opportunities for the industry players within the halal sector. The center services extend beyond a single market and are focused on the development of the halal industry both regionally and internationally. From a global perspective, we know there are key markets in terms of producing and consuming halal products. We are targeting those countries as their industries are the main contributors to the global halal trade flows. However, we are also experiencing interest from other territories realizing the opportunities available in the global halal market. Some of these requests come from regions such as Eastern Europe, sub-Saharan Africa, or Central Asia and increasingly from non-Muslim majority countries as they also want to capitalize from this huge and fast-growing market. Our access to these markets itis substantially supported by our service partners who are geographically spread out in different parts of the world.</p><p><strong>Though these services are global, how does the center fit into the mandate of promoting the halal trade through Dubai?<br></strong>In 2013, His Highness announced his vision to position Dubai as the capital of the Islamic economy, which resulted in the formation of the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC), which has the mandate of realizing this vision. The Islamic economy comprises the Islamic finance, halal trade, and Islamic lifestyle sectors. HTMC is a key contributor of DIEDC's mandate in activation of the halal trade flows globally and through Dubai. Dubai's strategic position as a global trading hub with vast international connectivity provides a great platform for HTMC to grow the halal industry and achieve its goals. In addition, Dubai in the last few years has been able to attract key stakeholders who contribute to the Islamic economy infrastructure of Dubai, and HTMC is now one of the key components of this ecosystem. As a result of our global interactions, we are also promoting Dubai as a gateway for the global halal industry.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for HTMC moving forward?<br></strong>Our mandate is to be the main reference for the halal industry on a global level. We will further strengthen our services portfolio so we can serve the industry by enabling them to realize economic benefits and outcomes. In the coming years, we will also grow our network with new service partners and achieve our goal of boosting halal trade worldwide. We want global industries to capitalize on HTMC to maximize their share in the growing halal markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What innovative developments is the company currently working on?<br></strong>KSB has a broad range of services and products, all related in some way to the transportation of water and other fluids. We combine 150 years of experience as a company with the newest technology, and digitalization is a major part of our scope. We supply equipment, such as pumps that run all day and night in places like pumping stations, chemical factories, and buildings to provide water and other fluids for various systems. Making all our products reliable, efficient, and state of the art is our main focus. Pumps themselves are not new technology, though there is still room for improvement—this where we are innovative at KSB. We have engineering hubs all over the world, including in Germany, France, China, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and North America, to mention a few. We use all these hubs to improve our products.</p><p><strong>Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) is working to increase sustainability through energy innovation and water management. What kind of opportunities does that create for KSB?</strong><br>Many of our pumps are used by authorities such as DEWA because we provide top-notch service. Whenever we install a pump at one of its plants, pumping stations, or other facilities, our people can service it directly here. We do not need to bring in people from overseas to do this work. We also offer them preventive maintenance, frame contracts, and additional equipment. Digital technology can detect problems with pumps and provide early warnings of the need for preventive maintenance or options for more efficient operation. Although Dubai and the UAE in general have a lot of capacity in terms of energy production, energy is still expensive here. One can save a lot if they make their equipment more efficient and reliable.</p><p><strong>How does Dubai play into the company's expansion and future opportunities in the region?<br></strong>From Russia to South Africa and Morocco to Pakistan, Dubai is our center and headquarters for the entire region. We have a massive responsibility, working in 80 countries, with 16 companies, and four factories under our scope. We do not coordinate everything from Dubai, though we oversee it from here. This demonstrates how important Dubai is for us. We have factories in Pakistan, South Africa, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia. The company here is focused on sales, handling our business in the UAE together with our service company in Abu Dhabi. Because of our product portfolio, we can handle all the different markets. In the Middle East, our strength has always been water supply and transportation, including desalination and the energy sector. Many of the power plants in Saudi Arabia and the UAE have a tremendous amount of KSB equipment. In terms of geographic footprint, we are seeing more business in Iraq now, and business is increasing in the UAE too. We had some bad times in the Middle East, especially in 2018, when our entire business went down. Now it is picking up again.</p><p><strong>What are KSB's strategic priorities for 2020, and where would you like to take the company as a new arrival to Dubai?<br></strong>The main idea for 2020 is to stabilize the business and perhaps to do some smart rearrangements and reorganizations with our companies to better support smaller countries. For a long time, the focus was on the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. We already have great business in Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and other Middle Eastern countries, but here we can definitively do more. The idea is to grow the contributions of smaller markets while stabilizing our business in the bigger markets at the same time. We are discussing doing more for in-country value and the Made in UAE brand. KSB is not really producing here, though we are thinking about ways to contribute more in the future with added value in Dubai, such as equipment assembly and so on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How have you pioneered change in the sector?<br></strong>We were fortunate to have started our business in 2003, when the economy took an upswing with the meteoric rise of the construction sector in UAE. It was a good time to be in business, and growth came by managing customers, suppliers, and inventory. However, we soon realized we had to be different than the rest if we wanted to continue to grow regardless of economic quirks. We embarked on the journey of process improvement and innovation to usher in a new paradigm in our history. We built a new state-of-the-art distribution center and defined a system of processes and work flows encapsulating the steps of the supply chain ecosystem, commencing with the goods rolling out from the manufacturer to the final customer. We interviewed our customers to discover their pain points and identified the services that would bring service and cost efficiencies. Next, we hired the best consultants to put together a technology platform that would help us automate as well as expedite the processes with a single objective of enhancing customer satisfaction. We pioneered the use of technology and best management practices in a traditional sector turning the stockist into a value-added distributor, thus gaining an equally important place in the supply chain ecosystem.</p><p><strong>How do you convey this message and promote yourselves as an innovative focal point in the sector?<br></strong>Our facility in National Industries Park (NIP) is a true reflection of the digital transformation that has taken place in Electric Way, and our state-of-the-art warehouse and equipment will give visitors a glimpse of this. Customers are already experiencing the speed at which we do business and are impressed by the array of value-added services we offer in comparison to our competitors. Our technology roadmap is in motion, and we plan to launch a transparent and efficient customer portal that will become an industry standard for end-user interactions.<br>How can the government support SMEs to grow similar to how Electric Way has developed into a regional player?<br>We are blessed with great leaders like His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. He is not just a visionary; he also ensures that his vision translates into actions that benefit businesses. Dubai SME is a great platform to support the SME sector, and other measures of the government have made it easier for genuine businesses to get finance and realize their growth potential. We are grateful to the banks in the country for their confidence in the SME sector and equally thankful for the business-friendly processes of all government departments when dealing with trade. The ongoing efforts to bring accountability and establishing credibility of business partners is helping businesses to thrive. Moreover, the UAE has proven to be a great hub in the region for all types of businesses including manufacturing, trading, and services owing to its fantastic infrastructure.</p><p><strong>How will Expo 2020 influence Dubai, and how will Electric Way leverage these opportunities?<br></strong>Expo 2020 will be great milestone in Dubai's history, and we hope it will catapult the overall economy of the country. As a supplier to the various Expo 2020 projects, we are thrilled to be a part of such a globally visible project, and we feel immense prestige in being associated with it. Electric Way is working with large contractors and supplying a wide range of electrical and construction material for the pavilions and expo facilities. Our innovative services such as just-in-time are attracting new customers who are working under tight deadlines and budgets. We hope Expo 2020 will attract not just tourists but many other people including entrepreneurs and investors who will find Dubai a place to start new ventures and use it as a launch pad to bring their businesses to the region, thus benefiting us all. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about DRC's presence in the UAE, and how the company has positioned itself here to work across markets?<br></strong>DRC is one of the oldest manufacturing companies in the UAE. It was established in 1959 and signed a contract with PepsiCo in 1962 to become its exclusive bottler, manufacturer, and distributor for beverages. For the first 50 years, we focused on soft drinks and also launched Aquafina water in association with PepsiCo. Eight years ago, we made the decision to expand the facilities, finishing this factory in 2016. The idea was to expand the capacity to diversify the product portfolio and use it as a stepping stone to expand the business into other categories of beverages and snacks. It also allowed us to start expanding geographically and grow our relationships. One of the great things about our business is stability; however, after we built this factory and made this large investment, we were surprised by an excise tax that targeted cigarettes, energy drinks, and carbonated soft drinks. The tax is about five times the global average, at 50% of the retail price.</p><p><strong>Do your operations here serve only the UAE or GCC market?<br></strong>Our contract with PepsiCo is for Dubai and the northern Emirates; we have what we call an exclusive bottling appointment. We are also exporting products to several neighboring countries. They are usually countries that do not have a PepsiCo operation, and we sell to traders who supply them. We also occasionally supply other PepsiCo bottlers with products or packages that they do not produce themselves.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy for the export market and using Dubai as an export base?<br></strong>Export for us cannot be a substitute for the local business; it is opportunistic sales from our point of view. We leverage the unique UAE location and significant shipping and export infrastructure advantage to drive exports to neighboring countries. Buyers come to the UAE because of minimal regulations, ease of doing business, connectivity, quick exporting procedures, and stable currency. Recent developments with VAT and increased regulations has made exports more difficult; however, once people get used to the new system and once some of the new barriers are ironed out, I expect the UAE to regain its position in exports.</p><p><strong>How is your solar project evolving?<br></strong>Our solar power generation project was completed in March 2019. The new building has a 50,000-sqm roof and was designed to carry solar panels. One of the programs the government made available for industry is the Shams Program, which allows solar installations to connect to the grid and receive credit for power generated. Users do not have to invest in batteries to store the energy, which makes the project viable. The positive effects on this project's margins were immediate. Our entire factory here is silver LEED certified, largely due to the substantial efforts we make in electricity and water conservation and reuse. This is excellent for the environment, but it is also profitable for us. We are now generating about 35% of our energy needs from our rooftop solar plant.</p><p><strong>What will be your most important steps to maintain your long-term financial sustainability and market position?<br></strong>We have to do two things that are critical. First, we have to expand our geographical footprint in the GCC and the Middle East in general. There are too many beverage manufacturers, particularly in soft drinks, so I expect some consolidation. It is important to benefit from maximizing the use of this new facility, and expanding geographically will help generate efficiencies and increase our ability to withstand shocks. It will allow us to also expand the portfolio more easily. In addition, we need to expand beyond the beverage portfolio and create new verticals. The beverage business is more mature now, and, unless we find growth opportunities in new verticals, our growth will be limited.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Maersk apply innovation to increase transparency and efficiency in shipping and supply chain solutions?<br></strong>We approach innovation and technology in a number of ways. Our current vision is to become the global integrator of container logistics. That is our response to a changing industry wherein customers want more end-to-end solutions and a more managed service and product. Our website is one of the largest B2B sites, with over 35,000 users transacting 20,000 bookings daily. This online booking management is a step forward for our industry. In addition, we are working hard to bring innovative ocean products to our customers. For example, we have an online product that allows for an instant quotation, instant booking, and guaranteed space on a pre-defined vessel. We are witnessing significant volumes for this product, with the uptake developing much faster than we originally planned, particularly in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and India. Moreover, we use less fuel in the shipping process, allowing for a better environmental approach to our operations. We are also building many new land-based products, including trucking, customs, storage, and warehousing. Trade finance is another emerging segment we are looking at. In the last three years, since launching our financial product, we have dispersed loans of about USD650 million to more than 200 customers, who have shipped about 60,000 containers with us in that period. Together with IBM, we have developed TradeLens, an open and neutral industry platform built on blockchain technology. Around 60% of the world's global container fleet and other shipping lines have signed up for it. Through TradeLens, we can bring a lot more transparency, reliability, and security to our client's supply chain.</p><p><strong>How do Maersk and Dubai plan to leverage geopolitical trends?<br></strong>The geopolitical situation is constantly moving, and so far, the impact has been quite manageable. We have seen shipping from China move to Southeast Asia and India. Our global presence offers us the opportunity to reassess the fleet, becoming less centered on certain markets and more diversified. We will continue to invest in China and are concentrating on Southeast Asia to create the infrastructure needed to enable faster growth. Maersk is also heavily investing in India. Saudi Arabia is the second-largest market in the world for refrigerated imports, which is why we are developing our cold chain in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. We continue to invest in the Americas and Europe, where we are building our landside infrastructure to support our strategy to be the integrated, end-to-end provider. Our investment is universal, ranging from anything between Turkey and Bangladesh.</p><p><strong>What differentiates Maersk from the competition?<br></strong>The company is in a clear transformation from offering legacy, traditional freight-dominant products to becoming the global integrator of container logistics simplifying customer's supply chains. Our advantage comes in several different areas. First, we are a strong brand, perhaps the most recognized in our industry. We have become the most recognized Danish brand in the world, building trust and delivering high levels of service and innovation for our customers for 120 years. That allows us to be able to move into logistic spaces with confidence and high financial stability. With arguably the finest customer base in the world, we have recently put more effort into listening to customer feedback. We have a methodology whereby we can quickly test our offerings, listen to customer feedback, and then make the necessary modifications to create compelling customized solutions. The Middle East and Indian markets, particularly Saudi Arabia and northern India, are pilot areas for our new online guaranteed shipping product, called Maersk Spot. To accelerate the transition to carbon-neutral shipping, Maersk has set the ambitious target of having net-zero CO2 emissions from operations by 2050. We hope to inspire researchers, technology developers, investors, cargo owners and legislators to come together in co-development and sponsorship of sustainable solutions that we are yet to see in the maritime industry. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>
