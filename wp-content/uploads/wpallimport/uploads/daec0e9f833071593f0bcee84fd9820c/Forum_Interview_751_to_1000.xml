It may take a day or even three days to leave. We do not use this model, and instead tell our customers the exact transit time. It doesn't matter whether this truck is full or not, it will still leave Almaty. This is the most important consideration because more than 60% of our costs as a company are transport related. If you are a private transport company, you never send a half-full truck, as it constitutes lost revenue. Once we committed to invest, the first six years registered a loss. At the same time, we were trying to establish a solid network and good service. And today, customers know that our transit time is the best in comparison to that of our competitors'. In this manner, for the past two years we have been generating profits and creating dividends for our stakeholders.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are developing an advanced logistics system known as 4PL, providing combined and comprehensive services and high-level integration with clients and logistics partners. Our major client is Eurasian National Resource Corporation (ENRC), the main strategic partner is Kazakh Railways, and now we are working to integrate our IT-systems. This allows us to provide increased efficiency for the client. Our main goal is to provide our clients with the best services at the best price, and to reduce transportation costs. In order to manage this, we implement the 4PL model. Another useful practice is that we employ Supply Chain Management (SCM). Supply chain execution means managing and coordinating the movement of materials, information, and funds across the supply chain. We own 10,028 railcars, 1,845 containers, and 696 platforms, all managed through our 24-hour dispatcher center. Today, we have an ambitious project known as the Logistics Management System (LMS). It is a long-term project, and the main objective for us in 2014 is an integration of IT-modules into one consistent system.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Kazakhstan is a strategic location for Agility, a global company with global contracts and clients. We work with these companies worldwide, and they need logistics branches in many locations. Whenever there is a shipment coming to Kazakhstan, we are here to support, deliver, and meet our customer's expectations. This is the major benefit of having a large number of offices worldwide. All the terms and conditions worldwide are the same, and it is convenient to work with a known global company because we guarantee service quality. Our headquarters are located in Almaty, and we have a representative office in West Kazakhstan in Aktau; however, the plans are to develop western Kazakhstan and open a branch. The market is there in terms of projects. Another one is Astana, which is the growing capital, and all major projects and decisions are made there. We are actually looking at projects and working closely with members of KazEnergy and other oil and gas service companies. With their support, we get the right information for upcoming projects in oil and gas sector. This gives us more chance to be prepared on time and create a strategy for these projects.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Kuehne + Nagel has a special role here; we offer the logistics solutions Kazakhstan will need. We are the first and only company to offer hotel logistics services. We had already been offering that worldwide, allowing us to bring that experience here to Kazakhstan, where we are expecting huge demand. We are growing sustainably here, and currently have 30 people working with us. By the end of 2015, we expect to have about 100 people. Our team in Aktau is expanding rapidly, and we need more space here in Almaty as well. We have some contract logistics projects in Astana and Almaty that will require an extra 50 people. I see the most demand in integrated contract logistics. By that, I mean big international firms such as Proctor &amp; Gamble or HP, which want to work with a single logistics provider along the entire supply chain. We have conducted studies with Bosch in Kazakhstan, and we are working on developing this side of our business. Other companies are also looking at Kazakhstan as a regional hub to branch out into the rest of Central Asia, and we are looking at working with various clients in this context.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The construction of concrete roads has increased, and this is what we are engaged in the most. At the moment, we have 15 concrete pavers working in Kazakhstan, which is probably more than in any other country. We call them slipform pavers. On the China-Russia road, there are 16 slipform paver machines: 15 from Wirtgen, and one from Gomaco, an American company. We are expecting five more machines in 2015. The China-Western Europe project is progressing well. And we also have other projects, such as Astana-Karaganda and Astana-Pavlodar, both of which will also be concrete roads. The industry is growing rapidly. We use the best machinery available in the world. We plan to invest more money in our business in Kazakhstan and will build new offices, warehouses, and workshops. This means that Germany considers Kazakhstan to be a good place to invest and a promising market. We have offices and warehouses and everything we need, but up to this point we have been renting. By obtaining our own premises, we are making a commitment to the country. With my 15-years of experience here, I can say that this is a good decision.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Astana Medical University has set the primary goal of development and “Improving the quality of educational services and the results of the core activities of the University, while strengthening its competitiveness" in pursuance of the message of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev and the main development strategy of our state. In the framework of this strategy, the university performed  its priorities, such as improving the quality of applicant selection and admission to the university, strengthening the material and technical base, improving the quality of implemented study programs, human resource development, the introduction of innovative educational technologies, and the integration of science and practice. Taking into account international practice in 2006, the university started establishing new standards and the training was carried out in six specialties: general medicine, dentistry, nursing, public health, pharmacy, and preventive medicine. Thus, the Office of the Registrar and Advisory Office were opened.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Currently, in the US, more than half of the universities are research institutions. We do not have many in Kazakhstan. The Kazakh-American University is intended to be a research university, but we are under pressure to find more sources of investment. We have formed a new board of trustees, and I am enthusiastic about its role of involving strong, new companies that will also invest. Year by year, we hire more and more researchers, particularly professors who do both research and teaching. Thirdly, research means having extensive horizontal links. We need to find more talented and successful professors who can involve their students in ongoing research possibilities. We have acquired a separate piece of land outside of Almaty, to create an American-style campus. In Europe, it is more difficult, because European universities are old and built in historical areas. We are looking for investors. I would like to see a more traditional system of education, because we have already implemented too many changes. The education sector is not an industry; thus, it is not possible to witness results after a short time.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It is especially important to be in regular contact and understand the real economic needs of the market. Most important for us is the employment rate of our graduates. When we plan our curriculum, it is important to be sure that the market really requires these professionals. We have created a special community, so to speak, by function, not only to include our tutors, but also well-known employers. This is the Academic Council of Educational Programs, where CFOs and heads of banks, for example, teach our staff the needs of the financial sector to determine the actual content of the educational program. Obviously, we also invite prominent business people as guest lecturers. Our university is the coordinator of educational programs across five specialties, and also looks to employers to assess the right education path for us to take.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our strategic plan is to become one of the top 100 universities in the world. A four-year college term in Australia costs a significant amount of money. For John Hopkins University in the US, it is $40,000 per year, or $160,000 over four years. KIMEP tuition costs less than $8,000 per year. Over the course of four years, students invest approximately $30,000. Yet in terms of employability of students, for a KIMEP student it is at 93%. This is one of the best indicators. The second indicator is the employer approval rating, or level of satisfaction, with our graduates. We have the highest at more than 90%, and student satisfaction is also remarkably high. These are some of the most important criteria. KIMEP was the only Western-style university in Kazakhstan; there are two more now, but they are still in the formative stages. We have the highest concentration of Western faculty members; numbers that not even St. Petersburg or Moscow can match. Approximately 40% of our faculty come from the West. Everyone is AQPQ certified, meeting the criteria established by international accreditation agencies.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In Kazakhstan, the retail landscape has changed and developed quickly over the last two years. Competition in retail is harder than before, suppliers are more professional, and local production is increasing. As a result, everything is more complex. In such an environment, Ramstore has succeeded in constant sales growth by following stable and straight business strategies. Over that period, we invested in new stores, and as of today we have reached 25 supermarkets and hypermarkets, which are operating in seven different cities. This is a tough market of around 16 million people, and the geography is huge relative to population density. To combat that, we have invested heavily in infrastructure over the past two years, especially in IT, logistics, and human resources.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There are many factors that contribute to success. If you set up a discount store, you need to stick to certain practices. Low prices should be followed by appropriate marketing and acquisition policies, as well as indoor and outdoor zoning. A store needs to be convenient from top to bottom. It should also allocate adequate space for parking. We use four-level stacks and merchandise pallets. More importantly, we aim to keep a limited number of stock keeping units (SKUs). An average department store markets around 30,000-40,000 SKUs, while we offer no more than 12,000. We strictly stick to our basic principle of keeping prices on 60%-70% of SKUs at least 5%-10% lower than our competitors. In addition, we select the most prominent goods and arrange them according to brand.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">One of the advantages of merging with local partners is that they have a stake in the business. What I mean by this is that they are not like the managing director of a company who always thinks about money. It is about trust. If you look internationally, Kazakhstan is often compared with Russia. However, I think in many ways it is more like an Asian country, especially if you look at the way people behave and do business. In China, they say a signed contract is just the start of the cooperation. It is very important to have a contract, but it is just the base from which to begin working with one another. Through actually working with each other, you back up your promises. For suppliers in Kazakhstan, if you don't have volume, they are not interested in you. Here, I like that many producers have their own business.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Until 2010, our main task had been business mentor management, which included organizing conferences and seminars, and the implementation of training grants for Kazakhstan and Central Asia. For the past three years, we have been developing in the field of corporate events, such as team building, advertising campaigns, and corporate celebrations. One of the most outstanding events of 2013 was the Third Central Asian Trade Forum held in cooperation with the USAID Regional Economic Cooperation Project and KAZNEX Invest in Almaty. The event included a trade exhibition of Central Asian exporters, and a competition for the best exporter of 2013 title, as well as the Forum itself, in which delegations from Afghanistan and Pakistan participated. We had a winner from each country, and one from Central Asia, a company from Uzbekistan applauded for generating sizable exports. Our services range from transportation all the way up to writing scenarios and bringing in artists for specific events. We work with all adjacent service providers, such as security and hosts. Essentially, we deliver turnkey solutions for any event idea. We plan to open an office with permanent staff in Astana in 2014. At the moment, we only have representatives working there for us. We also intend to increase our activity in Bishkek, and expect many investments in terms of brands coming to Kyrgyzstan.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our company was inaugurated in 1994, and we are celebrating our 20th anniversary in 2014. The company was formed during a period of economic restructuring when we were passing from a planned economy to the free market model. When the Financial Industrial Investment Corporation Tenir was established, it lacked a particularly clear objective. Therefore, we opted for the more general name of Tenir, becoming the first firm to engage in consulting, analysis, and recommendations. Initially, we served Tenir company projects; however, when the number of external clients increased, we decided to separate and create the Tenir Project in 2000. Through it, we offer the core services of expert and management consulting. Management consulting involves the development of management systems, and the improvement of organizational structures and development strategies. Meanwhile, expert consulting features such services as analysis, financial modeling, and marketing. In recent years, demand has mostly arisen from the energy and building materials sectors, although we have had experience working with a far wider range of industries, too. We are characterized by realism in that whatever solutions we council on are based on our own experiences. In management consulting, we write realistic development programs in order to present a balanced system, meaning the clients avoid misunderstandings among employees and discuss any errors that may have arisen.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Services, outsourcing, and consulting are three elements that are unique and self-contained. For example, recruiting is similar to sales; we “sell" candidates. Here, we depend on the quality of our sales. Recently, we introduced a new Russian mobile application product for recruiting in the Kazakh market that is called Pruffi. The commission for recruiting services is between the charge for executive search and for the employment agency's commission, and it is not a cheap service. One might advertise more senior jobs at recruiting agencies, and not so much administrative staff, for example. This is why we brought in the Pruffi product, where external people can recommend candidates and where one can find an administrative or lower level job; it is called “social headhunting." Out-staffing is more stable now, but there are risks related to these types of services, which should be covered. When you have a couple of positions “closed" through recruiting you already have a larger profit than outsourcing brings in over a one-month period. However, out-staffing generates consistent profit from month to month. We started to provide out-staffing services during the crisis of 2007-2008, and we also provide separate HR management and accounting services.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The auto market only really developed after Kazakhstan entered the Customs Union, because Kazakhstan—with a population of just 17 million—is a small market. The Russian market, by contrast, is large. The Customs Union was what gave us the ambition and commitment to become involved in car assembly and production. We had a distribution and import company here for some time, but our market share didn't really grow, remaining at around 10%. Meanwhile, the other 90% was dominated by unregistered used car dealers that didn't pay VAT. There are 3 million cars in Kazakhstan, and 80% of them, about 2.5 million, are at least 20 years old. That's because Kazakhstan didn't have a customs duty on second-hand cars, so naturally that's what everyone imported and sold. The Customs Union increased customs duties to 30%, and car manufacturers were suddenly given incentives to develop.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Renault has been represented in Kazakhstan for the past decade, compared to the 20 years that it has been present in Russia. Kazakhstanis generally opt for brands like Toyota and Mercedes, while French brands like Peugeot, Renault, and Citroí«n are barely represented. Our market differs entirely from Russia. In general, our well-to-do customers prefer Toyota, and the middle-class customers buy Daewoo. Over 2013, we sold 4,920 Renaults and 12,132 Toyotas in Kazakhstan. We succeeded in increasing the sales of Renault cars through the large volume of effective marketing staged by the head office. We no longer use the word “affordable," but “available" when describing Renault cars.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We would like to expand, especially as we will be offering many new models. We will be expanding our network of dealerships from 11 to 13. Volkswagen, for one, has released a new range of vehicles, particularly in Russia and Kazakhstan. Nowadays, we are heavily involved in talks on the possibility of manufacturing Volkswagen cars in Kazakhstan. I am optimistic about the future as we have projects and new models in the pipeline. Nonetheless, we are wary of the potential for a slowdown in the market, in parallel with Russia, which could materialize in 2014. Naturally, such matters correspond significantly with the global financial market and external issues.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It is typical of new and emerging markets. There are differences between mainstream Europe, for example, and the emerging markets of Asia. As these purchases form a significant percentage of clients' incomes, and especially where they are their first vehicle purchase, people want to be sure they have bought the right product. It remains a social rite to be seen to have a new vehicle. We see more sedan sales than hatchbacks, because the sedan is more traditional and more easily recognizable. Customers essentially want strong brands with solid reputations, because their friends and relatives will question why they spent so much on something they were not sure about. There are some variations of course, but, in the end, people still want the same basic things in a vehicle: durability, quality, and value for money.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Sony Kazakhstan is marketing the entire range of products without exception. Our priorities are determined from the market size and our share within the market. Hence, TVs will always be a larger business line than voice recording devices, even though one may enjoy a 50% market share with the latter product, while for TVs one's share is at 5%. Therefore, in terms of product range, we encompass all segments of the market by presenting the full complement of products. The Sony product range is, more or less, about home entertainment; it comprises TVs, home theater devices, and the PlayStation 4. Other important products for us are cameras—both fixed lens, changeable lens—handycams, and action cams. Action cams, as they are called, can be carried around and are very light cameras with a good battery life, meaning they are perfect for sport activities. Tablets and phones are not just things you carry with you, but are also the heart and core of connectivity. Near-field communication (NFC) technology is something that we are implementing in an increasing range of products. All new phones and tablets are NFC enabled, including many of the TV and audio products, which have wireless speakers.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our commitment to bringing innovative technological solutions to our consumers has earned us eighth position in Interbrand's Top Best Global Brands report in 2013, as well as global leadership in the TV, smartphone, and semiconductor markets. As far as Kazakhstan is concerned, we continued our market leadership in 2013, securing the number-one position in the following categories: panel TVs (over 40% market share), digital smart cameras (almost 30%), monitors (almost 30%), microwave ovens (over 40%), refrigerators (over 30%), vacuum cleaners (approximately 50%), as well as the smartphone (almost 60%), and tablet (over 50%) markets led by our flagship models such as the Galaxy S4, Galaxy Note 3, and Galaxy Tab 10.1 2014 edition. Evidently, no business can achieve long-term success relying solely on its products. Samsung cherishes the expertise and knowledge of our Kazakhstani partners as well as the loyalty, forward-thinking nature, and sophistication of the local consumer.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In a highly competitive environment our Consumer Lifestyle team managed to win and sustain leadership positions in a number of key categories. In the first three quarters of 2013, we demonstrated positive share growth and secured leading positions in personal care and beauty products, garment care (irons and steam generators), as well as continued progressive evolution in an important segment for us, namely kitchen appliances (handblenders, multicookers, meatmincers, juicers, and other appliances).</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We see a great potential in the SME market due to the changing IT landscape as a result of cloud technology. Up until recently, high-level solutions and services were only affordable to large enterprises; however, thanks to the cloud paradigm, every business can use the same level of services and solutions. It is cost effective, meaning there is no need to build local infrastructure to buy services and pay for people to maintain them. There are some attractive offers for medium-sized businesses where they can pay $18 a month for one user. Microsoft doesn't sell directly, meaning this is just an estimation. This price includes Office, and the entire exchange link infrastructure, as well as email solutions, and it allows people to use Office on five different devices. These are flexible solutions, and give SMEs software that before was only available to large businesses. It also gives us the opportunity for our business and the IT industry as a whole to grow. Kazakhstan is developing rapidly. It is currently not at the same level as Slovenia, Germany, or France, for example, but it is progressing quickly. You cannot compete in the global economy without having strong IT infrastructure. There is nothing bad in being a follower because Kazakhstan can observe and avoid the mistakes other countries have made in the development of their IT infrastructure.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The RBC Group was founded in 1990 when the territories of the CIS were still within the Soviet Union. The company grew in Russia, and in 1994 had its first client in Kazakhstan; a solar company that needed modern Western accounting software. Our company now sells the license for Western software solutions for business purposes, such as accounting, purchasing inventory, and effective sales, as well as human capital management and budgeting. We are partners with Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, and Infor, as well as other vendors, including QlikView. The Kazakhstan office was established in 1999 and, until 2007, grew by around 30% to 50% annually. Meanwhile, the market, as we see it, has stagnated—it is not growing, but neither is it going down. That is the general situation. Some companies are growing, some are dying, and, in general, our business is not growing as it did before. The main industry for us is oil and gas, and practically 80% of our revenue derives from this sector of the economy.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The SAP university alliance is a long-term strategic investment. It is not aimed at gaining any profit this year or next year, but by employing this alliance, we are striving for long-term success and cooperation in working with Kazakh companies, our clients, and partners toward the development of the IT market and state economy. Unfortunately, the demand for skilled personnel grows faster than the actual supply, meaning at SAP, and with our alliance, we are trying to satisfy this demand. That is typical not only with SAP solutions, but in general in the IT sector and the entire CIS. We have already signed an agreement with two universities, the Kazakh-British Technical University (KBTU) and the International University of Information Technologies. At the end of 2013, the International University of Information Technologies introduced the first academic certification center for IT specialists. We also plan to launch a distance-learning center for IT students. It will be called SAP ERP4students. SAP has conducted over 100 different seminars and workshops in Russia and the CIS. As a result, 47 universities participated in those workshops and over 1,700 people were introduced to SAP solutions and products. Participation in these programs in the CIS, and specifically Kazakhstan, will allow us to lay the foundations for the future development of the IT sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>

Based on their requirements, we manage their crews, pilots, maintenance, and operations. They should just be able to go to their aircraft and fly where they want, while we worry about the details. We also manage a charter aircraft that supports one of the major oil companies in the region. We are providing the air bridge for Tengizchevroil (TCO) down in Atyrau, between Atyrau city and their base at Tengiz. On its behalf, we operate an aircraft as a shuttle between the two, and also provide a complete meet and greet service in Atyrau for its incoming staff. When they arrive from overseas our staff meet them, get them through the process, take them to the TCO gathering service where all arriving staff are mustered or grouped together, provide them with overnight accommodation, and then the next day put them on the air bridge over to Tengiz. We also entirely manage the Tengiz airfield. Air traffic control, operations, airfield safety, security, and check in; we do the lot. We manage three maintenance facilities in the country, with hangers at each facility. All of these facilities come under our ESL145 maintenance approval.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The issue in Kazakhstan is not only to build a factory and have helicopters; we also want to transfer skills. We want people to have the ability to customize any helicopter and perhaps, one day, even design one, although that is as yet a remote project. The higher you are on the industrialization ladder, the more time you need to achieve your targets. Another issue in Kazakhstan is that by law we are obliged to deliver in the year we are contracted. This is a major issue in our business because a commercial helicopter's assembly time varies between 14 and 24 months, which means that we are obliged to start a supply and production operation in Germany before being contracted by various bodies in Kazakhstan. If we sign a contract in April, we have just a few months in which to deliver. This means we cannot develop our industrialization as we would wish to. However, we hope to solve this problem over 2014. Our target is to have the helicopters for painting and customization works at least six months before delivery in Kazakhstan. We would also ensure that the product meets EU and US standards.</span></p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In the company's expansion plans, our president selected three potential markets to start operating in: Ecuador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. For our country's particular case, the company noted high levels of business investment and security protecting foreign investors. There were also evident market opportunities resulting from prospective know-how transfer from our headquarters in Venezuela to an industry with true potential, in which our company would quickly make an impact through our products and services. The sector represents 1.3% of the Dominican Republic's GDP. In terms of premiums per capita, which is below $100, the Dominican Republic is 30th in the ranking among Latin American countries, while there are others in which premium per capita reaches $3,000. Industry research shows that only 175,000 of the 3 million households in the country are insured, so the sector has notable long-term potential. We have a workforce of over 300 employees that have been trained in Seguros Constitución. Additionally, we work with more than 600 insurance brokers that actively take part in the market.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our main competitive advantages are economic solvency (in 2012, MAPFRE's global turnover was over ‚¬25 billion across over 45 countries), flexibility, innovation, reliability, quality products and services, and competitive tariffs. In order to increase per capita insurance expenditure, we require a population that owns property and has the purchasing power to afford our products. This moment is about to come for the Dominican Republic, after crucial progress over the past few years. With regard to the regulatory framework, we need to revise issues such as accrues, release emergency reserves for companies to remain solvent in the case of a natural disaster, and revoke fees on life insurance (currently charged with a 16% tax, leading many people to purchase this type of insurance outside of the country). These and other regulatory changes would mean growth for the industry with the development of its products and services and more economic resources for the country. SMEs can generate a rich, layered development and, with their development, the insurance sector can follow along.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Dominican Republic has registered the highest growth rate in the Caribbean region over the past few years. Furthermore, the penetration rate among insurance products is still quite low, meaning the market requires specific solutions. This is a company with many years of expertise and experience behind it, and our main goal since we started operating here has been to evolve from providing products to providing solutions adapted to the Dominican market. We recently launched a personal life insurance plan that represents a turning point in the life insurance segment, offering a combination of insurance protections that have never been seen in this market before. Certification and training is crucial, and we already have 74 certified small and medium brokers that we are taking to Medellí­n for an internship to learn from one of the leading companies in Colombia and transfer our know-how to the Dominican insurance market. Seguros SURA implements the “cross selling" approach, meaning that once we attract a new customer, we try to offer them a wide range of integrated services to cover their properties and possessions.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We estimate that by 2016, we should have invested around $270 million. YoY, from August 2012 to August 2013, we realized savings of $53 million, a marked record for the industry. As we complete the rehabilitation of networks, we will implement communication strategies at a neighborhood level to raise awareness of the need to be an efficient user of the electricity network and contribute to the cultural education of our clients in terms of energy efficiency. It is important to show consumers that the country does not gift electricity. Current state deficits in the sector reach around $2 billion. The continued rehabilitation of networks comes at a high cost of around $550 to $600 per person. In order to reach a balanced situation, we should rehabilitate and normalize around 60% of the entire tendered area, as our remit encompasses some of the poorest regions of the country. Our low-income customers face difficulties in settling their monthly electricity bills. We are currently working on the rehabilitation of nine large networks that reach as many as 70,000 clients, and this will improve the distribution of electrical energy as well as payment levels among our clients.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Innovation and entrepreneurship have been key elements in Grupo Almonte since our establishment. In fact, we introduced smart metering and sub-metering to the Dominican Republic, and built the first building under USGBC/LEED criteria (Edificio BANAS), in addition to the first Merchant Plant (Victoria I, 105 MW) for SENI. The high energy prices and problem of blackouts experienced in the country prompted us to develop our services in energy efficiency and management, aiming to help the competitiveness of our customers and saving millions of dollars in the long run. Besides conventional energy services, we are working on renewables and sustainable architecture by using site conditions to improve efficiency and reduce energy consumption. We are also attempting to improve the human dimension of the system, by ensuring that errors in reading and billing do not continue to contribute to energy expenses.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our business activities are related to electrical energy production and technological integration. We have taken on the role of developer in one of the country's strategic sectors, with a special focus on large-scale production projects. In this context, we have a concession in the Dominican Republic for a 50 MW solar plant that could legally be expanded to 100 MW. Our role is to ensure the construction and operation of such a project to the highest standards and quality levels. Rather than operate plants ourselves, we transfer the operation to specialists. The project is connected to the national network as part of the nationwide strategy to change the energy production matrix, and we have the Payment for Purchase Agreement (PPA) in place with the government. We have an investment budget of a little under $120 million. I personally think that there is no other country in the world with the features of the Dominican Republic, especially in terms of size and its position as an island with such strategic maritime and air infrastructure capacity.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Seaboard has been operating in the Dominican electricity sector since 1990, but there is still much opportunity in the sector, not only in generation, but also in commercialization. We have invested $140 million in the electricity sector, as we know that the real figures for demand are high. After working here for 24 years, I can say that it functions as well as in the past; the bureaucratic process was manageable, and local contractors worked well, while there were no issues regarding the employment of external contractors. Having the backing of a public corporation, such as Seaboard, capable of funding us when needed, helps considerably. The timely collection of invoices for power generation is not the norm in the country, and companies typically collect every three or four months when arrears accumulate. We need to ensure that invoices are paid in a timely manner, and that investment in infrastructure improves the transmission and distribution of power.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government allows independent producers to develop and select their own technologies, which automatically leads to a better range of technologies being available at national power plants. The drive to develop renewable energy projects also requires back-up options as the output of wind farms and solar plants is subject to constant fluctuation. It is imperative to have a steady frequency for industry, although of course there is always the risk of peaks and troughs in the system and the potential for blackouts. For this reason, I would argue that a decentralized power plant network on the islands is the optimum competitive solution for the required end result. When I began at Wärtsilä Dominicana, we had an installed capacity of 600 MW, but today the figure is at 1.4 GW. We hold approximately a 50% market share, and have the highest capacity utilization rate (CUR). We have introduced large, dependable diesel and gas engines that run continuously, the engines of which have been running for over 45 years. We have also constructed power plants all over the Caribbean in partnership with Dominican companies, which is a clear benefit for smaller contractors and companies.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Dominican Republic offers a wide range of business opportunities, where significant returns on investment can be obtained.  Some areas of opportunities are: tourism, high technology, IT and communications, contacts (call centers), infrastructure, manufacturing, agribusiness, renewable energy, and the film industry. A good business climate, the political and economic stability that characterizes the country, its strategic location, and its solid legal framework for foreign investments, modern transportation, and telecommunications infrastructure represent part of the appeal that the Dominican Republic offers for developing profitable and successful businesses.The Dominican Republic also offers foreign investment incentives for some sectors such as free trade zones, renewable energy, film production, and others.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">For manufacturers, the Dominican Republic will be a hub in the long term because of other limitations. The Caribbean today, as we understand it, is in the process of economic diversification to spur growth. A key element in this is ICT infrastructure, since an island requires excellent connection to avoid isolation from the wider world. We are in the process of building our presence in the Dominican Republic because we view it as a capability center. We are impressed by the large number of local engineers, many of whom were educated in the US or the UK. In fact, we are in the process of accumulating resources at this center in order to serve Caribbean neighbors that lack a skilled workforce. We have been working with a local university, many students of which are keen to join our workforce and contribute to our strategy.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have excellent connections with the Caribbean islands, the US, and Central America as a whole. Venezuelan and Colombian companies have also expressed interest in organizing within the Dominican Republic. The FTAs we have with Europe and Central America have made us an attractive base of operations. The current government, enjoying an approval rating of 80%, has a real opportunity to lead the way. The Dominican Republic has a promising future, and ASIEX's members recognize this. One of our key advantages is our geographic location; we're in the center of the Caribbean and in close proximity to the US market. If we want to be more effective, we can show the short amount of time in which goods reach the US from here; we can make a good offering for that. In this country, we have 40,000 people working in English-speaking call centers.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As the economy progresses, the approximately 10 million Dominican citizens have more access to information, and as a result diagnostic standards improve, and the market expands. I think we're going through a transformation in this market and, as we develop as a country, the population should seek to satisfy the next level of their needs. The first priority is to expand access to quality products. We need to give the right medicine to the right patient, ensuring efficacy, quality, and safety. Sustainable access to medicine requires sufficient healthcare infrastructure, distribution, and financing. Governments play a principal role in addressing these issues. I believe the Dominican Republic has growth opportunities as it develops and modernizes its infrastructure and healthcare provision.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Bepensa Group has been present in the Dominican Republic since 2006. In that year, Bepensa signed a strategic alliance with Refrescos Nacionales, the bottling company for Coca-Cola and decided to settle in the Dominican Republic. Our decision was motivated by the country's stability, security, and guaranteed growth, which we considered to be the ideal scenario for our internationalization beyond Mexico. During the past seven years, our extensive experience in the production, bottling, and distribution of non-alcoholic beverages has allowed us to turn Bepensa Dominicana into a leading company, offering quality products that have generated over 2,500 direct and 10,000 indirect jobs, positively reinforcing the industrial sector and national economy in general.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Today, we represent well-known brands such as Volkswagen (we are its exclusive representative in the Dominican Republic), Audi, Seat, SsangYong, Subaru, Hino, Motul, and Kumho, among others. Free trade agreements (FTAs) play an important role in our business. The Dominican Republic has an FTA with the EU; however, we pay two taxes that amount to 35%. Regarding the US, while we only import certain products, we also have an FTA. Finally, we must mention Asian markets, because we import Hino trucks from Japan. We achieved record sales in the country with 35,000 vehicles sold in 2007. However, I think it is difficult to reach such a level again due to current economic trends not only at the national level, but also internationally. Post-sales services comprise one of the most interesting segments of our industry and are a key to success; we always say that the company sells the first vehicle, but post-sales services sell the second one.</span></p>]]></sections01>

The target client has changed accordingly, and today's potential customers are keen on the quality, unique design, and construction of a Jaguar. Such changes have to be understood within the context of national development and the improvement of the road infrastructure. For example, 4x4 models are largely sold in the Dominican Republic due to the country's geographic characteristics, and we have managed to grab part of the market share in that segment. TATA acquired Jaguar Land Rover some time ago, subsequently unveiling a £5 billion investment plan in R&amp;D, manufacturing, and plants. Overall, the XF model, in all its variants, has proven to be the most popular vehicle of Jaguar's portfolio here; we have seen a sustainable rise in the demand of both 2.0 and 3.0 engine vehicles.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">When the company started in the early 1960s, it only had two brands in its portfolio: Daihatsu and Skoda. We stayed with Daihatsu and became market leaders with the brand, especially in the truck segment, in which we used to sell around 3,500 units annually, granting us a 98% market share of that particular segment. However, the truck segment was left behind in Daihatsu's global strategy and became outdated. Difficulties accessing credit lines denied the sector further growth. Banks are reluctant to lend to the middle or lower classes, and we have struggled to provide solutions for people who require taxis and buses for their professional activities. In the short to medium term, we plan to carry out economic and financial restructuring within the company, due to the losses we suffered from the elimination of our main product, Daihatsu trucks, plus our investments in marketing our Chinese brands here.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government is picking up the pace again in terms of public works. We have a positive outlook in terms of construction projects. However, I am not confident about the private construction sector as the monetary policy that is in place is too restrictive, causing interest rates to rise, limiting the growth of private construction. We see ourselves as a company that provides solutions for our customers. We are currently participating in highway construction, dam renovation, and channel construction projects, as well as new roadways. We have introduced innovative technologies, such as the Mesa and Ultraflex systems, but need to educate the sector. Usually our end-customer is not the Ministry, but the contractor. In our tiles segment, we add the finishing touches to buildings, and two major high-end hotel projects on the north coast have provided us with contracts. We are not just a structural solutions company, and have aesthetic solutions that are more design-focused, too. Today, we have over 180 distributors in the US, the Caribbean, and Europe.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have just opened a new store in Santo Domingo, and our model today involves stores of around 1,000 to 1,500 sqm in size. We expect to open one or two stores per year for the next five years. Approximately 65% of our sales are retail, with 35% to the sales channels of contractors and wholesale. Hardware is our area of expertise, having been in the sector for over 60 years. This said, we also offer appliances, furniture, lights, and other household items. The recession greatly impacted sales, as a result of which we decided to devote more time to our core business, abandoning categories that contributed only 15% of our sales, while requiring 85% of our advertising budget. Our business is family-friendly, and being attached to a mall has allowed us to capitalize on this. In general, on the hardware side of the business, our customer profile is predominantly male.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I brought the construction management approach to the country about 15 years ago. The first project we developed under construction management was Megacentro, a commercial center in the east. The second project was Ágora Mall, which was built on J.F. Kennedy Avenue. Now, we are developing a new cardiovascular center, CEDIMAT, also under the construction management approach. The difference between construction management and integrated project delivery is that with the former, our company is an advisor to the owner. We prepare all the bidding documents, run the bidding processes, and evaluate the bids, and make a recommendation. And once the construction process begins we become the technical supervisor and contract manager. Spain used to be a big investor in the Dominican tourism sector, but it simply doesn't have the liquidity anymore. We believe that from 2H2014, those investors will start looking at the tourism sector here again. This trend will also be reflected in the private real estate sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>

We strictly follow our basic principles in terms of regional development to ensure a return on investment. We work in outdoor advertisement, focusing mainly on the street furniture segment. We work across Kazakhstan and offer our services in all the major cities. In Almaty and Astana, we have outdoor advertisement constructions that comply with international standards. We will carry on advancing the street furniture network in Almaty and Astana. We are fully aware of the need to install supplementary street furniture in some cities. With Astana and Almaty, we show off the potential and capacities that can be of use in other cities that are interested in improving visual frequency.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">BASF is willing to develop its strategies in emerging markets like Africa, Russia, and CIS countries. We can bring a lot to a country with BASF's portfolio and improve the needs of our clients here. My first job here is to establish the country concept for the Kazakhstani market in order to properly address it. We are establishing ourselves in the mining sector, yet we are also looking into other markets that we could potentially contribute BASF's know-how to the benefit of Kazakhstan as a whole. I am convinced that we have the best technologies in the world, which can be applied in emerging markets to expedite their development.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Dow has worked with customers in Kazakhstan's oil and gas industry for the past 15 years. In 2012, we announced the establishment of a representation office in Astana to expand our local presence and level of regional customer support to supplement our global innovations in oil and gas chemistries. We have dedicated all our human resources into business development, because it is difficult for us and for Kazakhstani people to work from a distance. We need our staff to be at the project locations. For example, one of our local partners is launching a local mixing facility where Dow's oil and gas solutions will be used. As the country works to expand its network of internal and export oil and gas pipelines to support industrial growth and meet global demand, the industry will need an array of sophisticated technologies to maintain these critical assets. Dow provides a range of chemicals and raw materials that can help meet these needs.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Kazakhstanis have a greater technological perception than many other countries, and this explains the swift take-up of smartphones. In 2012, the smartphone market was between 40% and 50%, but today makes up almost 90% of the market. Customers are really quite eager to grab the latest technology, and that is why our strategy is not to forecast the lower end of the technological spectrum, but rather the high-end offering of the latest products. Kazakhstan's swift adoption of the latest technology also encompasses ultra-HDTVs. I have spent eight years in India as well as some time in Egypt and the UAE, and I still conclude that Kazakhstan is highly promising for LG.</span></p>]]></sections31>

There are severe limitations in terms of care in the public sector. Public health surveys reveal that 40% of people use public facilities, while 50% use private, because public healthcare here does not work. These services are intended to be both sufficient and free, and yet we have poor citizens receiving private healthcare. In my radiotherapy department, you will see patients that I have operated on who cannot pay for a hysterectomy for cervical cancer, coming here for radiotherapy because even the lowest insurance policies cover their treatment. This standard of treatment is not available in public institutions. Some specialties, such as cancer treatments, are even attracting people from other Caribbean islands. In addition, cosmetic surgery is emerging as a driver of medical tourism. The privacy we offer is also a major attraction. And meanwhile, we strike deals with international insurance companies that give their clients coverage here.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The prices of medications have oscillated by between 25% and 96% over the past nine years, and we organize buying processes according to the regulations outlined in Law 340-06 related to public health. National public tenders are used for 90% of the purchases, which allows for economies of scale and better transparency and participation. It is for this reason that the pharmaceutical industry has increased its participation in these processes since 2004. At PROMESE/CAL, we consider our quality control policies highly relevant. PROMESE/CAL needs to guarantee the availability of those most vital of medicines. This could represent 80% of the budget, while the remaining 20% should go toward managing hospitals to buy emergency products. The Quality Management System allows our General Management to run the institution, while sustaining its operations in a system focused on assuring the continued satisfaction of our citizens and interest groups. In this sense, it stores, distributes, and dispenses medications for 194 public hospitals, 1,264 first-aid units, 466 state pharmacies, and 2.5 million members of the subsidized National Health Insurance Scheme (SeNaSa).</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Amadita is opening new branches of laboratories across the country to respond to market demand and customer need. As a clinical laboratory, we invest heavily in securing the latest technologies, instruments, and methods available in the scientific community. We enjoy a leading position in the Dominican market, having operated for over 50 years with a network of 24 branch offices. Quality defines the level of trust in clinical laboratory results. The stricter the quality controls, the more accurate and clinically useful the results are to support a correct diagnosis and treatment of patients. One of our company's values is to serve, which is enshrined in our corporate culture. We are firm believers in giving back, and have been privileged to participate in many initiatives to promote health awareness, including fundraising, donation, academic work, internships, and environmental campaigns through the Amadita Foundation. Preventive care is a public health issue that should promote healthy nutrition, regular exercise, and annual check-ups.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Abu Dhabi faces challenges similar to the rest of the Gulf, since the small number of UAE doctors and nurses are insufficient to treat the predominantly expatriate population. As we progress in the UAE and develop partnerships, this situation may change. Other good doctors at different stages of their professional careers are willing to come and share their clinical expertise. In 2012, well over 5,000 doctors and nurses attended MENA’s events. Our personnel are preparing for JCI accreditation, and over the next five years our strategy is to become the best private hospital in the region and the preferred choice for the services we offer.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Diabetes is one of the world’s fastest-growing health issues, up from 371 million people in 2012 to 382 million, according to the International Diabetes Federation. It is suggested that approximately 18.9% of the UAE’s population is living with diabetes. ICLDC offers holistic Diabetes Management care for every patient. We have a faculty of educators—nutritionists and dieticians—who guide each patient on healthy lifestyle habits. We are very active in the community with our public health awareness program, “Diabetes-Knowledge-Action,“ under the patronage of Her Highness Sheikha Fatima bint Mubarak. Our message is that diabetes and related complications can be managed and even prevented by adopting the smart, simple steps of a healthy lifestyle practice—a balanced diet and daily, brisk exercise.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Care and health services in Abu Dhabi are in many ways equal to those of the US, particularly at Sheikh Khalifa Medical Center (SKMC). We signed a major agreement with the Higher College of Technology that will afford it priority in rotations at SKMC and expose more nationals to healthcare positions, as we advance the Emiratization process. SKMC has active programs to take individuals who make up the leadership of our health system, and send them to the Cleveland Clinic for a 12-month fellowship course in hospital management. We work very hard to find the right people to complete their education and residency positions in our hospitals in the UAE.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our academic programs have grown from seven to 38, some of which are at the Bachelor’s level, some at the Master’s level, and one at the Doctoral level. When we started in 2003, the university had merely 900 students. Today, the number is close to 5,200, and is growing rapidly, both in terms of student body and quality. Our strategy for the faculty has been to attract international talent with expertise that is recognized worldwide. In 2010, the university won the prestigious Sheikh Khalifa Excellence Award (SKEA), marking the very first time it was awarded to a university. We have over 40 local and international partners that enrich our academic mission and support our strategic goals. Locally, we partner with public and private organizations, such as Abu Dhabi Environmental Agency, Tawazun, Etihad, and ADDED. Internationally, we partner with institutions such as University of Illinois, Purdue University, Tulane University, Norwegian Air Research Institute, Singapore National University, and Seoul National University.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our precursor, Etisalat, was mostly geared toward telecommunications and training undergraduates for the future. What we have today, and we are currently planning a significant expansion, is a broad-based engineering college that covers all fields: biomedical, electrical, computers, aerospace, nuclear, and telecommunications. We now also have PhD programs in all of these fields. Etisalat continues to contribute significantly to the Khalifa University Sharjah Campus, especially in telecommunications and electrical and computer engineering. Khalifa University was created by a decree to become the UAE’s principal research university in engineering and biomedical sciences, as well as moving into natural and physical sciences. We enjoy a strong relationship with Georgia Tech, Texas A&amp;M University, Bristol, and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We were the first college in Abu Dhabi to offer a Diploma in Computer Science back in 1985. We were also the first private college in the country to earn accreditation for our associate degree programs from the Ministry of Education. We have been offering Bachelor’s degrees in business administration, management, HR, marketing, finance, and IT since 2010. Our vision today is to emphasize applied learning and applied scientific research. We are a practical college, and we need to build our graduates to be able to join the industrial field. Our image in the market is that we are your practical choice. The government supports public education, and it tries to do its best with the universities. In the private sector, there are some difficulties according to financial issues, but the Ministry does not differentiate between private/public in applying standards. It is now concentrating on research, and it wants to bring more expertise from outside to the UAE to build a knowledge-based economy in Abu Dhabi.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We work very closely to provide the maximum benefit to the country as far as our programs are concerned from an educational standpoint. We are very proud of what we are doing here at the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT). It is unique in its standing that it also has a very independent Centre of Excellence for Applied Research and Training (CERT). Our aim is to make sure the university has a think tank, commercial arm, and research bank functioning side by side. For the 2013/2014 academic year, we welcomed over 6,000 new students, an increase of about 35%, which indicates that we are providing Emirati students with the right options. Our graduates are highly sought after, largely because of our learning style. There is room for more universities to come to Abu Dhabi — particularly in specific specializations that are much needed in the economy. People are coming to study in the UAE from countries such as India, on the strength of our universities.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The beauty of working in this part of the world is that you feel directly connected to a strategic vision. Everyone in Abu Dhabi is on a mission; they want to achieve something. In 2012, we revisited the vision of the College and decided to benchmark it nationally, regionally, and also in the UAE, as well as link it to the national Vision itself. We want to become one of the leading private universities in the UAE. My academic approach acknowledges that real learning is something that you can put into action. Our strategy is service differentiation. We have around 70% UAE nationals and 30% expatriates. Out of the 70%, I would say that about 60% are male students and 40% female. On top of this, we organize an international conference, the Organization Learning Conference, for the MENA region, where we host guest speakers from over 20 countries. This reach establishes a platform for the market, clients, and the broader community.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GORDON SLAVEN</h4><p>The UAE as a whole is a remarkable country in terms of education and the development that has occurred over the past 30-40 years. Currently, we do not have any UK universities with a presence in Abu Dhabi, apart from Imperial College, in the form of the diabetes center. The local environment is complex here with the Emirate level, the federal level, and then the private and the public sectors. We work closely with the Ministry of Education, and we run a legacy program of placements for medical students in the UK each summer. Our flagship education event, the Going Global conference that took place in March 2013 attracted 1,300 participants from 80 countries, and the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT) were our key delivery partners for that.</p><h4>PR. DR. ERIC FOUACHE</h4><p>Paris-Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi is a unique project between the Abu Dhabi government and the French university, Paris-Sorbonne. The government is building a society where intellect from around the world comes together here in the Middle East. Higher education in the UAE is truly integrated into the Economic Vision 2030, and is seen as an economic sector in itself. We represent the French and francophone market in this sector. We are implementing a research department in 2014 and our first priority is to build a national network with the federal universities. We will use the research development to build a network at the international level, mainly based on the Francophone University of International Development (FUID). We have signed MoUs with UAEU and the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development (ADDED). We started with 150 students, but now have over 700. We enroll just 40 students out of 105 that apply, and have a 95% success rate for the bachelor's programs. The idea of obtaining a French degree in the UAE in an Arabic country boasting strong growth is very attractive.</p><h4>DR. GARON WHEELER</h4><p>The New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) was the first licensed American university in the UAE. The President of NYIT, Edward Guiliano, is a firm believer in global and internationalized education. We had established campuses in Bahrain and Amman earlier. On a business level, I think the market here is essentially saturated now. However, there are still opportunities for people with the right approach. We have 200 students, but our goal is to enroll 1,000 students, which I consider realistic. One thing at the Bachelor's level is that at federal universities degree courses are free for nationals, while at the Master's level everyone has to pay. So for universities, federal or private, it is a completely open field.</p><h4>MIGUEL SOUSA LOBO</h4><p>Abu Dhabi seemed like a great choice for INSEAD. It has the right mix of openness to the world and economic energy, and it is also very well connected, which is important for us. Businessmen can fly in from all over the world for our executive development programs, which are held at the Abu Dhabi campus. We have a strong partnership with the Abu Dhabi Education Council. We have some competition in executive education, but less so for the Executive MBA. For the latter, we have many customized programs that are developed on a case-by-case basis with each organization, in response to specific needs. We also have events, such as our Global Business Leaders' Summit, and in 2013 we started the Career Forum for MBA recruitment, which involves working closely with recruiters. We also have chairs endowed by Mubadala, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank, and the Crown Prince Court. Part of our value proposition is selectivity and the international diversity of our programs' participants, and as such we'll never be a large local volume player.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are mainly catering to the oil and gas sector, which is my area of expertise and knowledge. I have 15 years of experience in the sector and have acquired great knowledge on the topic. The oil and gas sector is very difficult to enter because it requires many contacts. What we are trying to do is specialize in this sector by providing niche services. We cater to all types of requirements in equipment, minerals, industry, and construction—anything related to oil and gas development. We are focused on meeting these diverse needs, whether companies require contractors, consultants, chemicals, or equipment suppliers. We know and cater to the demands of the sector. The oil and gas sector in Abu Dhabi is stable. It is large and expanding, and there is always limited competition due to the nature of highly technical requirements and specifications. Unless a company knows what it is doing and is specifying the requirement of the client, it is difficult to provide a service. It is crucial to provide high-quality services.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">ABB has known this region for a very long time. Where the oil and gas industry is concerned, the first consideration is to be in a country where you have customers. Dubai, for example, is not the place to be. To be taken seriously, you have to be present in Abu Dhabi. The Emirate has shown admirable resilience over the years. It has also shown a conservative approach to growth, and has proven to be stable. In sum, Abu Dhabi is the place to come to if you have long-term plans and desire visibility in the oil and gas sector. Additionally, from a communications standpoint, it is a good place to be. Take Saudi Arabia, for instance, which is the biggest market for oil and gas, representing 50% of the total GCC market. We don’t base ourselves there because you can only serve the Saudi market, as you still face significant constraints regarding visas, entering the country, and other related topics.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As a company, our main activity is selling top-of-the-range oil field supplies. Examples include WKM or Cameron’s Demco line. These are high-end products and generally come from the US. We also have an anti-slip product from Australia named the Vigilante Slip. We pursue the best products in the market. Our salespeople visit clients and ascertain their particular needs, whereupon we provide optimum solutions. Ours is a very mature market, which is why one must stay ahead of technology and create new niche products. Basically, it just comes down to your customers needing such things as high-impact gloves. Today, these are the industry standard. Abu Dhabi is a very stable market; this is one of the main reasons why we are based here. We are so well established today, and there is such amazing infrastructure here, which can easily access different regions.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the last couple of years, the UAE has started to expand its production capacity, and this has already impacted us. A few years ago, we were seeing a large amount of our business coming from outside the UAE, but then, when Abu Dhabi started expanding its capacity, there was an increase in demand for our services. Our external revenues started to decrease as our local activity increased. This is going to impact us because, as much as we try to expand externally, we are experiencing an increase in local demand. This is stretching our resources, and it is not only Abu Dhabi that is seeing expansion, but everyone else in the region as well. Our competitors are facing the same challenges. It is not just about having the equipment, but also having the right people. Finding qualified, quality people is a challenge. Since the Arab Spring, there have been many restrictions on which nationalities can get visas in the GCC countries, and that is a challenge for us.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The mall features 80,000 sqm of relevant retail space for the community, with 180 retailers across five floors. The project has great visibility to the main Dubai highway, with over 500,000 cars passing per week. Access from the highway is very convenient and the parking is designed to allow people to get in and out of the center quickly and efficiently.  In terms of size and scale, Deerfields Townsquare is amongst the top 10 in Abu Dhabi, and we expect 12.5 million visitors in our first year of operation. Retail tourism is recognized as one of the main means of increasing the number of visitors to the city in the governments Vision 2030. A key part of this strategy is to develop retail malls with more entertainment offerings. Abu Dhabi’s population is growing, and the Emirate has one of the highest levels of GDP per capita in the world. For retailers, Abu Dhabi is becoming an increasingly attractive location to showcase their brands. As of today, the retail sector in Abu Dhabi is undersupplied and this provides a sizeable opportunity.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the last six months of 2012, for a variety of reasons, there was an influx of liquidity into the market, so it recovered in terms of growth as well as sustainability. We had many opportunities to collect real estate. In 2010, everybody was beginning to feel secure, but there was still a problem in terms of return on investment and financial obligations. We are still in a period of recovery. We are now in a good position, as the Abu Dhabi government announced that it would invest AED330 billion over the next five years, which means we are talking about at least AED60 billion per annum to be spent in a variety of sectors supporting infrastructure, which would include jobs, health, and other sectors. Tasweek is a name that stands for marketing. We wanted to stand out as a marketer of real estate. Our portfolio is worth $250 million and it has a good yield per annum. It is an income-bearing asset, and we want to expand this in Abu Dhabi and beyond.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The market dropped and we had to work hard over the 2009-2010 period to maintain the position we had built up. Nevertheless, we achieved that and maintained our local staff levels, managing to ride out the storm with a number of new and diverse projects. We have gradually built on this and now have a well-balanced portfolio of projects across our services and sectors. The UAE is a very important part of our global strategy as a business. We have an aspiration to be 50% in the UK and 50% international in three to five years, and the UAE itself we would like to be around 15%-20%, with our Qatar office also contributing a similar level. These two regional offices give us a strong base from which we can enter markets in other parts of the world and expand our portfolio. That is our short-term aspiration. Building on our reputation is the way I believe we are going to increase our growth here. Our client relationships are absolutely key to securing projects and performing well for those clients enhances our reputation immensely. There has also been a growing awareness of Hilson Moran within the market and that has seen clients approaching us.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">After 2008, there was a shift toward infrastructure and there was less demand for buildings and hospitality projects. Based on Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, we are now focusing on healthcare projects, education, and infrastructure including rail, roads, and utility work. We have not realized any direct impact on the construction industry. Nonetheless, the philosophy of Abu Dhabi has been focusing on increasing the revenues from non-oil and gas sources. Tourism has been identified as one of these areas to generate income too. Abu Dhabi is UAE’s primary gateway to the world, which makes the location convenient. It is very well developed, with established systems that make it suitable as a home base and is an appropriate location to position your core team here to service other countries. There are enormous projects in the pipeline and the prospects are big.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Cluttons has deep roots in the region and the business is well supported by our professional and consultancy divisions, as well as property management. We moved here in the 1970s and the Dubai office was opened 35 years ago. We entered the market early, before many of our competitors. We are 15—20 years in front of some of our main competitors and have grown an old and diverse client base, which has helped us achieve our position. The bubble was built on speculation, especially in the residential market. Regulating mortgages is one way of preventing this to an extent, as well as regulating developers and purchasers. It is clear that the government is concerned about it happening again, especially now that prices in Dubai are increasing. The areas that are going up are newly built areas in Abu Dhabi such as Raha Beach, Raha Gardens, Saadiyat Island, Al Reem Island and Al Reef. There is currently strong demand in the city for newly built modern developments. A decree was made in 2013 that if you work at or for a government agency or company affiliated to the government, you will have to move to Abu Dhabi. Our residential team now reports that as much as 40% of enquiries in some locations are linked to people moving here from Dubai. This has helped fuel demand.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Airbus Group has a strong presence in the UAE, where we continue to grow and support our longstanding partners in achieving their objectives. Our products and services are well-adapted to the country. We have a proven commercial policy while also developing a cooperative industrial approach. The A380 has been here one of our key successes, as leading international carriers such as  Emirates Airlines and Etihad Airways have chosen to operate this aircraft. We have also been successful with the air fueling tanker, the A330 Multi-Role Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft, used by the UAE Air Force. Regarding space activities, the UAE has created Yahsat and we were chosen to deliver  two satellites and the associated ground infrastructure to the country. We are proud to be in the UAE and our aim is to contribute and support the leaders in achieving their Vision 2030 goals.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our presence here goes back to the 1970s. Other companies have been providing equipment and systems to the army, navy, and air force since the 1980s, but theirs was more of a buy-sell relationship. Today, it is a deeper, more integrated relationship. It’s a matter of investing in a country in a way that yields it an advantage. We work with some local companies as a sub-supplier to produce parts for aerospace activities related to the construction of aircraft. There are three foreign companies working with Strata, which is a part of Mubadala Aerospace. The goal of Strata is to create a “state-of-the-art“ industrial plant for special composite materials, which are the future of aerospace. We are engaged in a comprehensive transfer of knowledge, because you need to transfer not only equipment, but also processes and skills developed over years of production.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">When I look at Abu Dhabi, I think of our partnership and community engagement. Over the past five years in particular, we have heavily focused on bringing innovation and technology to Abu Dhabi. Our aim has been to help enable and realize its Vision 2030, specifically in aerospace and aviation. There has been a personal involvement and commitment to the relationship we have with the UAE from the most senior echelons of Boeing. There is not a day goes by without Boeing’s leadership team asking what we are specifically doing in the UAE. In 2008, we realized that we had to change the way that we did business. Before then, we would basically just parachute in the sales team, which would win or lose a sale, and leave, whereupon another team would come in to execute the project. Then, you would do offsets, and most of that would happen outside the US. We decided to create a localized team, and we looked at ways in which we could partner up with Mubadala. The entire process took some time, and the combination in the UAE is interesting, because there is a large commercial airplane market and a particularly large military market. We realized they were going to want some payback and partnership. So, rather than working on offsets, we came in and truly started to source work outside of any transaction, based on the belief that it would pay off over time.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The satellite deal with Yahsat was a prime example of the potential of this sector. More recently, the Falcon Eyes satellite deal shows how promising and strategic these projects can be. This will enable us to strengthen our local presence as well as to create strategies for developing further cooperation with local industry in various technological domains. Aerospace is an area of great importance for us in this region; huge budgets are invested in airport development and security where Thales has been the systems provider of choice at both Abu Dhabi International and Dubai International airports. Additionally, our UAE defense market share is growing, and for this we provide equipment, systems, and the knowledge to be able to use them. We also know the people when it comes to acquiring equipment, such as radar or communications systems, which is why our expertise is relied on at such events as the upcoming Abu Dhabi 2014 Global Aerospace Summit.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The UAE is a longstanding and important customer and partner for BAE Systems and, with the excellent communication links Abu Dhabi has across the Middle East, we have all we need to establish our company’s regional hub there. We have a long history and understanding of manufacturing techniques in aerospace, maritime, and land systems, which we can explore with Emirati companies looking to develop their own capabilities and efficiencies in these fields. The development of Abu Dhabi’s indigenous defense and aerospace industry has been a remarkable story, set against the ambitious targets of the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 for the industry. We have seen the rapid growth of industrial clusters in Al Ain (Nibras) and the Tawazun Industrial Park. The targets set for future capabilities are ambitious and exciting. We will continue to search for the best options to support this vision.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Firstly, Abu Dhabi benefits from its strategic geographic location. The UAE sits at the center of a global crossroads that stretches from Moscow to South Africa, and from Singapore to Morocco. Abu Dhabi lies at the heart of this important region—a centrally located global transit point for international business and leisure travelers. The Emirate’s key geographic position was also one of the factors identified in the recent decree that created the new Abu Dhabi Global Marketplace free zone on Al Maryah Island. Secondly, the ambitious economic diversification plan set forth in The Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030 is attracting leading companies from across the world and numerous industrial sectors. And the fact that Abu Dhabi sits on ample hydrocarbon wealth provides it with the means to pursue and achieve this diversification strategy. Thirdly, during a period of uncertainty in the MENA region of several years, Abu Dhabi has remained an attractive and secure address to do business in. The UAE is a beacon of stability in an otherwise turbulent region. Finally, while we are focused on business issues today, it is important to note the significant role that the UAE has played, and continues to play, on the international stage in terms of security and intelligence cooperation, regional diplomatic initiatives, international coalition efforts, energy security, and regional trade. This engagement has put Abu Dhabi on the map with global businesses and policy makers.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Back in 2007, during the boom, many people were optimistic about the future. We were expanding all over the world, to Russia, the US, China, Vietnam, and the UAE, which was one of the hottest spots. The UAE was sizzling then, so it was the right move at the time to establish a presence here. We studied the market, and the major obstacle we observed was consumer resistance to the types of housing and buildings that we produced. The issue was that people here were not used to the North American style of home. And so we launched a market research program to understand what people were really looking for. But then, immediately after our arrival, the crisis broke and demanded a change of plans. We had to restructure the company because the shareholders who bought the factory from us in Canada struggled and were impacted by the crisis, and by the end of 2008 were even considering its closure. Yet by mid-2009, we had managed to save the factory. Thereupon we decided to relocate from Canada with our own management team. We struck an agreement to manage the factory and allow the Canadian expertise to be involved directly. We subsequently managed to reverse the course of the factory and improve business. We then began to establish a technology base that enabled us to cover the entire region. Currently, Genesis exports to Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">When we arrived, we opened the office with a combination of senior in house staff relocated from our UK office, with the knowledge of our company ethos which we wanted to carry through all our offices, coupled with a number of regionally experienced people that we recruited. This combination has provided a strong base to our office, which is then further supported by our UK teams. We have been steadily building on very strong client relationships and feel that being client focused is an important aspect of our business success. Meanwhile, the hotel segment is clearly key, and the growth of regional airlines provides opportunities across multiple sectors. There are of course projects related directly to the airport, as well as those associated with airline facilities and the buildings they need to operate from, the facilities they need for staff, and then hospitality projects, which come about from all the tourism that results from these travel hubs. There is a clear alignment there for us. The transport networks, not just air, but also the metro systems, which are expanding in the UAE and those proposed for Qatar and Saudi Arabia leads on from this. We are already actively working in this sector with the designs associated with these metro stations. There are more opportunities for us in these areas, and in the connected retail sector that complements them.</span></p>]]></sections21>

Both groups are interested in the status of their vehicle fleets. These systems allow 24/7 checking, as well as the monitoring of vehicle speed, the pinpointing of location, and indication of stationary time. Our most recent joint project was with state-owned Baku Taxi, where Caspian Navtel provided navigators for the entire fleet. By 2015, more than 2,000 taxis are scheduled for purchase, on which our navigators will also be installed. Additionally, we have been working with Taxi 189, a private entity, which also exclusively uses our navigators. Today, all taxi drivers are required to use the Navigator, which is the most reasonably-priced model on the market, and which we—as the only company in this line of busness in Azerbaijan—exclusively provide. Our GPS tracking services are also used by leading Azerbaijani banks, such as the Bank of Baku and Demir Bank.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Competition is heating up in the mobile broadband sphere in Azerbaijan. At the moment, we have competitors among mobile GSM operators. In certain product areas, we have a competitive edge. However, there are significant differences between the companies. For example, they do not offer CPE devices; they offer smartphones. Also, compared to the fixed DSL and fiber operators, we have CPE devices that are competitive with their CPE devices; however, they don’t have the USB modems, Wimaxion, or the mobility experience we offer. SAZZ occupies the middle ground between telecommunications providers and DSL providers. We offer mobility, but no voice services. Our aim is to do what we do best. We came to the market with a positive message, and we sport very attractive brand colors.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Caspian Telecom is the main network provider operating independently, which allows the company to provide high-quality corporate services to customers. We use the latest innovative technologies in our operations, while building up our fiber network for our clients. The company uses the latest fiber to the home (FTTH) technology, which implies deploying fiber-optic lines directly to the home or business to deliver video and data services. In spite of the high cost of its installation, the FTTH network has higher profitability and lower maintenance. Today, Caspian Telecom offers services meeting all standards to both private and government sectors, state companies, and financial institutions. Caspian Telecom is actively working to expand its coverage area. We have an extensive fiber-optic network in areas such as Baku, Ganja, and Gabala, as well as many others. In terms of the expansion of the optical line, the company plans to open new branches in other regions.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">ULTRA Project Department was fully involved in the development of the ASAN center. A team consisting of 12 people shaped a concept on a tight schedule as only three months was allocated for the opening of the first such center. This was a highly significant IT project, for which the specifications alone came in at around 200 pages. Every detail had to be provided for in the multi-structural solution. Each solution had to be competently chosen, and designed with the possibility of its integration, so that the way it would conduct coupled with other project elements could further the service steps. IT infrastructure virtually supplies all ASAN operations; thus, a wide range of scenarios had to be contemplated to anticipate the way each binding might conduct in certain conditions. Apart from that, the ecosystem had to be prepared for the connection of new branches.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have many competitors globally; however, I can confidently say that our platform, effectively a kind of emergency service, is the best available. We change the pre-paid service to a post-paid model for a limited period of time, such as when a subscribers’ balance reaches zero, in order for them to be able to continue making calls or other forms of communication. With our help they can use advance credit when they run out of pre-paid credit, for which we charge a service fee. When customers visit the point of sale to top up their phones, the fee and loaned credit are deducted from their new balance. The service fee covers the entire risk of the operators, even if subscribers fail to repay used credit, but purchase another SIM card. Yet because our credit limits are very low, it is not economically feasible for the subscriber to purchase a new SIM card. The only bad debt, therefore, arises if a visitor to the country leaves without paying the debt, or if a subscriber loses their phone.</span></p>]]></sections41>

We did this because we saw potential in Azerbaijan given its political stability and economic growth. The past 15 years have vindicated our decision. We now have 40 employees in Azerbaijan, and cover the whole country, because we are committed to expanding our customer base. GSK, over the last few years, has become a leader in the areas of respiratory treatment, antivirals, oral antibiotics, vaccines, and anti-epileptic medications. Right now, the latest IMS reports state that we are the third biggest in the pharmaceutical industry in Azerbaijan.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We came here in 2006 and started to build a presence by taking part in Azerbaijani national projects. We initially had the IP NGN—the next generation network project—that was launched in 2006 with the aim of transforming Azerbaijan and making ICT one of the main initiatives in the country. We have more than 40 Cisco partners in the country in addition to technology providers. The majority of financial institutions and government bodies prefer to work with Cisco. We are now in the implementation phase for new terminals at the Heydar Aliyev International Airport. The State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) building is one of our most tangible and visible projects, and it will all be connected with Cisco technology. We are also helping to build Baku Olympic Stadium, which should be finalized in terms of construction by February 2015.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We established this office in 2002, more than 10 years ago. Our first project was Nakhichevan Telecom’s NG-switch project in 2002 and, from then on, Huawei continued to invest in the telecommunications infrastructure network and added consumer devices to its portfolio in the country. In 2013, we became the main vendor for the CRA Group and Azercell, the country’s largest telecoms operators. We are also providing support to the CRA group to deploy a 4G LTE network, and are expecting it to be launched by the end of the summer of 2014. The development of the telecommunications market in Azerbaijan has been fast, with an average annual growth rate over 18%, and it is one of the fastest ICT growth markets in the CIS region.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have many common values with our sister country Azerbaijan, and speaking the same language is one of them. Azerbaijan, with its rich energy sources, and dynamic and growing economy has a strategic importance for us, and we aim to grow in the country. Aggressively growing trade volume and a developing economy are the other basic reasons why we’re interested in Azerbaijan. The fact that many international firms would like to invest in Azerbaijan is an indicator of the country’s potential. This economic liveliness is a great advantage for the banking industry. However, the infrastructure is still developing, and many of the new products and services need technological infrastructure. This is why we’re focusing not only on providing products and services, but also on developing the industry.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Schlumberger has operated in the Caspian region for many years and has built a significant operations footprint in Azerbaijan, Astrakhan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. Consequently, the region is important to the company’s growth plans. Also, the different Caspian operational environments have challenged the company to develop and deploy different technologies to ensure hydrocarbons are produced efficiently and safely. The upcoming Shah Deniz II wells are a good example of the challenges that can be faced—amongst other needs they require precise drilling control, and highly reliable equipment.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The raising of awareness among the population regarding the importance of insurance coverage through educational programs is part of our daily activity. This also applies to health insurance, and we have offered voluntary health insurance from the outset. Meanwhile, compulsory health insurance is relevant for our country and our findings are enabling us to best pursue its implementation. Depending on the results of this work we will stage appropriate educational events. Note here that our country is registering notable international progress. Health insurance provides safeguards for patients and physicians, allows for more predictable operations, and provides a degree of confidence and prospects for both the state and society as a whole.<br></span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">One of the main obstacles to growth is low awareness of insurance among the population. That is why we, through the Insurance Companies Association and the Ministry of Finance, absolutely need to get the story out and present insurance not just in terms of accident coverage, but also as a savings instrument of wider practicality than people currently imagine. Meanwhile, the tendency for local property to be uninsured makes for a greater problem even than limited interest from the motor branch. Roughly 98% of property in Azerbaijan lacks insurance, be it mandatory or voluntary. There is a huge untapped market here, limited, however, by a degree of mistrust of insurance companies. The Ministry of Finance is working to raise awareness levels, and is aware that corporate transparency, also, is a deciding factor before potential customers sign on the dotted line.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Azerbaijan’s health system has developed rapidly in recent years, with many well-equipped hospitals having been built and numerous specialists training and studying abroad. As in developed countries, we will aim to combine our obligatory and voluntary private medical insurance offering. People have the right to also apply for voluntary medical insurance to access more comprehensive medical packages that cover additional hospitals. The implementation of mandatory medical insurance is not the only source of growth for the company and the wider sector. We have key prerequisites for development; the penetration rate of Azerbaijan’s insurance sector is at 0.7%, whereas in developed markets the figure ranges from 5% to 10%. We forecast that by 2020, insurance per capita will have increased by 250% to AZN100 per person.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In regard to the 2013 results for the market as a whole, group healthcare plans and motor fleet insurance programs have become quite problematic in terms of profitability. We observed an environment of fierce price competition, and consequently a price-sensitive market. In order to gain market share, price is important, as is the distribution network, commissions, and, most of all, quality service. Wherever prices are similar, clients consider other factors in deciding on a company, which primarily means the provision of quality service. We are pleased to have been the recipients of six market awards over the past three years from a number of organizations, among which were the accolade of insurance company of the year, and best quality service product, as these confirm that we do indeed meet the criterion of service quality. The success we achieve from such recognition is significant for a customer-centric company such as ours. We are sensitive to the needs of both customers and agents, which explains our emphasis on sales support for the network that sells the actual insurance product.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In 2013, we have successfully accomplished a corporate restyling. Immediately after that, we announced our innovative “Trust the Future“ insurance campaign to the market. Throughout the campaign, we have been offering motor insurance, which provided broad insurance cover coupled with low insurance rates of approximately 1.5% of the value of the car. The market average is 3%. We have also focused on promotion, adopting a non-traditional approach. We reduced our tariffs for this insurance branch and designed a memorable animated advertisement campaign where two talking cars conveyed a simple message, namely the true benefits of voluntary car insurance. We launched the cartoon on YouTube, Facebook, and other social media channels, which worked out very well.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have concluded that the basis for cooperation is extending steadily between the two countries, which have a potential foreign trade volume of $15 billion. As expressed by the President, Azerbaijan has really ambitious investment targets in Turkey. Among these, the Trans-Anatolia Pipeline is of paramount importance. I believe that this international project will reinforce our brotherhood even further as of 2018. The political, military, economic, cultural, and commercial cooperation and solidarity between the two countries is the best indicator of the level that our brotherhood has reached. I believe we will make many important investments together. We are taking and will continue to take steps and make investments, particularly in the field of natural gas.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Azerbaijan is a very important partner for us—we have achieved a reliable partnership in the energy field. We want to build on this, moving to a long-term association grounded in democracy and shared values, in particular human rights and fundamental freedoms. We are both extremely pleased with the progress achieved on the Southern Gas Corridor since our Joint Declaration of 2011. We have both worked hard for the realization of this strategic project for both Azerbaijan and for Europe. I wish to thank President Aliyev for his strong and continued commitment. I remember well our discussions when we met in Baku and, in fact, Azerbaijan has been delivering all the commitments that were taken at that time. And I’m proud that this declaration that I signed together with President Aliyev was at the basis of all these developments.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our states were exemplary in establishing relations leading to the strategic well-being for the future of the country and the region. Our projects create the best opportunities for the future not only of our countries, but also of other regions. Therefore, the exceptional partnership between our countries and the commitment to jointly implement our energy and transport projects provide a better future for millions of people in the region and beyond. At the same time, I want to note that Azerbaijan is extremely important for Georgia not only in terms of large-scale projects and cooperation in the fields of oil and gas and transport, but also in terms of culture, science, and human relations.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have carefully discussed key areas of strategic partnership between Russia and Azerbaijan and outlined plans for its further development, first of all, of course, in the trade and economic sphere. In this regard, I can note that despite the well-known decline in the global economy, our trade relations have developed and are still developing successfully. The increase, according to various estimates, ranged from 37% to 47% last year. Russia has traditionally been one of the leaders in the trade turnover with Azerbaijan. We are in second place. The first place belongs to Italy. But we all know that this is mainly due to the supply of hydrocarbons to the Italian and European markets, whereas the trade between Azerbaijan and Russia is much more balanced and noble, as experts put it. It includes machinery, equipment, and food. In other words, all that is vital to the economy of Azerbaijan and the economy of the Russian Federation.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Günay Bank was the first major private bank of Azerbaijan following the country’s independence. The banks established prior to us had some share of state capital and state funding; we were the first fully private bank. Our policy has been to remain a boutique bank and retain a small number of clients. I am proud to say that all the customers who started with us in the 1992 to 1995 period have remained with our bank. Today, we are working to increase our capital to AZN50 million in order to comply with the latest legal requirements. Currently, we have capital of AZN16 million, but by the summer of 2014, the figure is predicted to be at around AZN30 million to AZN35 million. We became a public company in order to raise our capital, and we have plans for two issuances of AZN10 million and AZN27 million, respectively. The latter should start in June 2014, and we are hoping to place all the shares by the end of the year.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Azerbaijani authorities have introduced a special program to support micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) called the Azerbaijani National Fund for Entrepreneurship Support (ANFES). Financial assets are provided to a partner bank at a low interest rate on the debt of 6%, with borrowers subsequently receiving the loan from that bank. MSMEs need to obtain an approval of their business-plan from the ANFES to be eligible for the loan. Another government initiative considered to assist in the development of new financial instruments, such as mortgage financing, is the Azerbaijan Mortgage Fund. The upper limit for a mortgage loan is AZN50,000, which allows one to purchase a good-sized two-room apartment in the city center. Zamin Bank is participating in this initiative and has provided AZN33 million in mortgage lending to date. Mortgage loans were extremely popular with our customers in 2011 to 2012, and we are planning to expand our mortgage services in 2014. There is also an initiative in the agribusiness sector that Zamin Bank participates in. Accordingly, the National Fund for Agribusiness Support is providing assets to partner banks, whereupon MSMEs receive a loan from the bank at a particularly low interest rate. All of these incentives are promoted and subsidized by the government.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Recently, significant competition in the granting of consumer loans has been noticed, and the requirements for granting loans have changed. While banks are working to increase their portfolio, it is important to properly assess the customer’s ability to repay debts. Too heavy a focus on consumer lending weakens the financing of other areas, such as industry, agriculture, and manufacturing, which in turn has an adverse effect on the economy. Currently, consumer loans account for 40% of total lending in Azerbaijan. The banks must correct this to better play their role in ensuring economic stability. President Ilham Aliyev himself expressed his concerns over this issue, and emphasized the importance of focusing loans on the real economy. It is clear from his statements that he envisages the banking sector supporting the economy, given that a stable banking sector is a prerequisite for economic prosperity. The Central Bank of Azerbaijan’s (CBAR) recent policy was in the same vein, as it took measures to shift credit to the industrial sector. As a result of these measures, I expect the banking sector to become more liquid, regulated, and stable.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Until recently, Azerbaijan has been known as an oil and gas producer and exporter and as an agricultural country. Of late, Azerbaijan’s high-tech equipment in the energy sector has been gaining a worldwide reputation. The Azerbaijani government pays special attention to the development of the non-oil and gas sector, and at the same time facilitates the production and export of domestically produced products. We are expanding our production and we are now finishing our fifth plant, a state-of-the-art facility where the production of large power transformers up to 500 MVA with voltages of 220-500 kVa will take place. The factory is equipped with the high-tech machinery of leading manufacturers such as GEORG, Hedrich (Germany), Sagma (Italy), and Highvolt (Switzerland). We will gear the production at this plant toward larger markets, and at the same time boost the country’s demand for strategic goods. We import raw materials from the UK, the EU, the US, Turkey, Russia, and Kazakhstan. For example, we import H1-grade magnetic steel from AK STEEL (US), which is high-grade steel produced at very few facilities in the world. It is a major component of transformers, and thus quality manufacturing is of the essence. Good quality comes at a premium, but for us there is no option but the best available. The main goal of ATEF Group is to get good market shares in places such as the UK, Europe, and the US.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Hilal Elektrik has excellent electrical and mechanical engineers, especially when it comes to major projects. We have 75 employees, and 25 of them focus on our service project business. Some of the projects that we are working on are with Azer Electric and Azersu. We discussed the need for more generators and regulators, which we would install and maintain, for a project with Azer Electric. Our spare parts come from Turkey, from which we receive trucks every week. Owing to this, our transfer of spare equipment parts is efficient. In regard to branding, the customers decide which brands and products we work with. Our employees may introduce a brand, but customers will ask for another brand instead. We then do our research about who is distributing this brand in Turkey and other countries. Customers who have visited China found a specific brand of lighting equipment and requested it be brought to this market. We are continuously expanding the list of brands we distribute. Nowadays, a large number of Spanish companies visit us for heating systems and cables. We are seeing a market in Spain for outdoor heating, because people now smoke outside in the garden, and, therefore, need a special heating system.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As a global specialist in energy management with operations in more than 100 countries, Schneider Electric offers integrated solutions across multiple market segments. Schneider Electric is involved in all the stages of the chain between the power plant to the switches and sockets in homes or offices, with solutions including hardware, software, as well as services. This means we are active in all markets, from public utilities to buildings, infrastructure, industry, retail, residential, and IT. We are working closely with the local authorities that know us through the numerous seminars we have given in Azerbaijan and abroad. Our clients are aware of the energy efficiency challenge and are willing to cooperate with us on many projects. One example is the Gobustan Alternative Energy Polygon Project developed by the Agency for Renewable Energy. This project aims at demonstrating how small- and medium-sized renewable energy generation such as wind, solar, and biomass can be effectively integrated into the power network of the Gobustan region, thus meeting a great part of the local demand, while being connected to the national grid thanks to the smart grid solutions developed by Schneider Electric. Another example is our cooperation with utilities and design institutes to contribute to the design of more efficient solutions for industries and homes.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have 25 sugar factories spread out over 55 provinces, and we employ up to 85,700 farmers, with 132 regional agriculture offices, and 249 sugar beet sales points. Türkşeker was ranked the second largest public company and the 16th largest company overall among the country's top 500 companies, with an annual turnover of TL2.75 billion in 2013. In 2013, we produced 1.27 million tons of sugar. In 2014, we aim to produce 1.3 million tons of sugar and 369,000 tons of molasses. There are eight sugar-producing companies in Turkey, and we account for 65% of all sugar production from beets. We also produced 6.57 million liters of ethanol in 2013. Last year was perhaps the most productive in the history of the republic, thanks mainly to favorable climactic conditions. In Turkey, as with the EU, sugar is produced in limited quantities based on a certain prescribed quota set by a sugar board, which includes the representatives of all the major sugar producers. In order to increase foreign interest and attract FDI, Turkey needs to reduce costs, develop marketing techniques, and make an effort to show that the Turkish sugar sector is profitable and worthy of investment.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Since 2010, Turkey has become a hub for MENA operations of Barilla. We have a plant in Bolu with a capacity of 120,000 tons of pasta, which is also used as a product source for the Middle East and Africa. With 42 plants around the world, Barilla has a well-developed network. The company views Turkey as a springboard for the MENA region. Together with our leading international brands, we also manage a local brand ''Filiz'' within our portfolio. In contrast to many multinationals, our principle is to maintain local brands and help them flourish as each brand owns some aspects of the local culture. One of the key principles at Barilla is local sourcing. From that perspective, we have roughly 30,000 acres of arable land and cooperate with 100 farmers to produce the wheat used by Barilla. We more or less have a 50% higher yield than the national average, and we share our modern agriculture expertise with the state. Barilla is the market leader in Turkey with a 28.7% value share as of 2013. More efficient irrigation will mean larger fields, and the potential to truly boost Turkey's agricultural output.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Working families need meals that can be prepared in 15 minutes or less. We are moving further away from traditional meals, which are both time-consuming and complicated to prepare. The shift then is clearly toward more practical and instant foods. These three important criteria: a stable national economy, a young and growing population, and the shifting of our eating habits have caught the interest of international investors. Turkey's geographical location is an asset. It has a strong image in the region; North Africa, the Turkic republics, and the Middle East have a combined population of close to 550 million people. This reputation has caught the interest of many, and should continue to interest foreign investors. It is a source of esteem to have “Produced in Turkey" stamped on a product.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Traditionally, in this country, women were, and to some extent still are, in charge of the home and the kitchen. Now though, they are spending more time at work and less time in the kitchen and want quick and easy food to serve. The only way that you can keep that kind of fresh meat product on the shelf for seven to nine days is by using what we call modified atmosphere packing (MAP), and the trend in this direction is extremely strong. Namet is the biggest meat trader in the country. After almost 40 years in the meat sector, we intimately know the market, the quality of meat and animals, and which animals yield the right meat-to-bone ratio. In 2005, we decided to purchase the Namet Delicatessen Company, and to invest in a new state-of-art production facility in Çayırova, Kocaeli province. We distribute through various channels. We lead in the tourism sector in terms of hotels, restaurants, and catering. From the Dardanelles to the Syrian border, we serve the majority of hotels, and are the leading supplier for international brands such as Burger King, Domino's, Sbarro, and Little Caesars.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Turkey has been producing 75% of the global hazelnut total, with an annual average of 650,000 tons, meaning $1.8 billion in annual exports to over 112 countries around the world. Almost three-quarters of exports are destined for Europe, and about 10% for the US. Hazelnuts grow on the northern coast of Turkey stretching from the Georgian border to Istanbul. Two million people are directly involved in hazelnut production, and five million overall are indirectly engaged in the sector. Export and local markets led to a total turnover of $2.5 billion in 2013. Turkish hazelnuts grow across 700,000 hectares. However, the yield is only one ton per hectare. That is nothing when compared to countries like the US, Italy, or Spain, whose yield is twice that of ours. We must increase our efficiency without enlarging the planted areas. We allocate certain investments to R&amp;D. Our 2014 export target is $1.8 billion.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been in the market for almost 35 years, so part of our success is due to our specializing exclusively on buildings. We are about to bid on a large hospital project in Erzurum. We are set to bid on five infrastructure projects: three are large dam projects, while two involve irrigation. We are now awaiting the respective tenders. The construction of housing will be dynamic over the coming years. I foresee the huge suburban residential projects continuing at the same pace. Much of Turkey is at risk of seismic activity, and a new Urban Transformation Law states that the Ministry can replace existing high-risk housing with new buildings. This will expand the construction of housing units, especially in the popular neighborhoods of Istanbul, as opposed to the suburbs.</span></p>]]></sections01>

Focusing on Istanbul, as a rising market for this purpose, provided a wonderful opportunity. Quasar Istanbul is our first project and spans 190,000 sqm, featuring 257 residential units, 210 hotel rooms, 16,000 sqm of offices, and 4,000 sqm of retail space. We are wholly focused on this scheme. Construction should be complete by September 2015, when our customers can collect their keys. Istanbul is a vast metropolitan city and still developing. Its inventory of buildings is old, and what's more there is a rising group of people with more disposable income following recent periods of strong economic performance, and they are upgrading their living standards. The ownership ratio of residential property is 40-60 in favor of tenants.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Nissibi Bridge project will connect a number of Turkish cities. To date, a basic ferry service has been in operation, and so the regional economy as a whole stands to benefit from a road connection. Adıyaman, Kahta, Siverek, and Diyarbakır were separated by the creation of the Atatürk Dam Reservoir on the Euphrates River, and domestic security issues also affected trade between different cities of the region. This bridge will cross the lake, and should hopefully contribute to regional peace and stability. We do not take on end projects worth less than $100 million. In addition to our traditional construction projects, we intend to diversify into railway construction. Historically, this has been the domain of the state, and we are entering a new chapter for private sector construction companies that are keen to become involved in this area.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have recently finished the $1.4 billion Otogar-Kirazlı-Başakşehir Metro, and we are currently working on the 20-kilometer Üsküdar-Ümraniye-Çekmeköy Metro, which we envisage to complete in mid-2015. The government's plan is to have these schemes and the third airport ready for passengers by 2019. Real estate-related businesses will reflect the economic climate, and even if there is business being generated, it will not attain levels seen over the past 10 years. New real estate projects are emerging depending on the infrastructure projects such as the third bridge in Istanbul and the new airport. Outside of the country, Turkish contractors are mostly active in Russia, the CIS region, the Middle East, and Africa. Their goal is to enlarge their area of influence each year by putting new target markets going beyond their geographical borders and reaching to countries far from their region, even in South America and Asia.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In terms of logistics, one of the main opportunities is volume, and moving volumes from A to B and from B to C. What has changed is the direction of the flows in our specific market. In the past, Turkey concentrated much more on Europe and sending goods there; however, Turkey is now becoming increasingly involved in the Middle East, which is a natural choice since Europe is having some economic difficulties. Turkey is trying to change or replace the goods and volumes going to Europe with volumes going to the Middle East. This is certainly something that has changed a lot for us, and it is an opportunity being able to go to the Middle East.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The logistics sector in Turkey requires regulation and should be supported in law. Turkey is a very well-located country geographically, and we are surrounded by the Aegean, Black, and Mediterranean seas. The problem in legal terms is that Turkey has not had a particularly sound operational environment. Until 2005, no one knew what freight forwarding was, meaning there were no laws protecting it. Yet, over the past few years, a better understanding has taken root as to what we do. Therefore, I foresee a robust future for the logistics sector in Turkey. We foresee strict regulation coming to the market, whereby opening a logistics company will be a more difficult task.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our sole purpose is not just making money. We want to carry what we learned in the West over to the East. We want to have superior quality and human resources. We have regional offices in Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Russia. In order to support our customers and lower their costs, we work as if our customers were our business partners. Offering customs clearance in other countries is our main advantage. Customs clearance in Russian-speaking countries is of great value to Turkish exporters. We have customs clearance licenses in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan. This is a valuable advantage over our competitors.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are a freight forwarding company, and are possibly the oldest directly foreign-invested joint venture in the industry. In 1997, looking ahead we realized Turkey's true potential. We wanted to be part of this future, and decided to invest directly in the sector. ALPI Group proposed establishing a 50:50 joint venture to develop business links between Italy and Turkey, but since we are a network, to also link all other ALPI offices and actively rather than passively work on increasing business volumes. There are around 350 ALPI investments and joint ventures including airlines and other companies involved in freight.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The huge gap in the eye healthcare field and our superior service are two of the main reasons for our rapid growth. In early 2014, two Saudi investment groups bought a 50% stake in our business, and although we are still in the initial phases of our partnership, we now have greater goals. Due to our collaboration with Nesma and Reaya Holding, we plan to have 20 domestic centers by year-end, increasing to 25 in 2015. The success of medical doctors and health service providers in Turkey is due to the stringent and vigorous medical and health services education in our schools. In January 2014, we performed 4,300 eye surgeries and had 50,000 patients visit our clinics.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There have been many developments happening over the last 10 years in Turkey regarding the healthcare system. The number of annual consultations per person has increased from an average of 2.4 to 8. Previously, health insurance companies would force patients to go to specific hospitals to receive treatment; however, nowadays the system has changed so these companies are now allowing patients to go to any hospital they desire. The infrastructure of hospitals and their locations, as well as the medical teams working in them, have been developed and strengthened. We have special marketing campaigns aimed at foreign countries to develop health tourism. We have already treated patients from 54 different countries. Foreign patients generally come for spinal surgeries, radical cancer operations, bone marrow transplants, and oncological treatments.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our focus here is our physicians; we have 48 different areas of expertise and are licensed in each of these fields. Our physicians are experts in minimally invasive and robotic surgeries, particularly in neurology, oncology-related surgeries, knee surgeries, and specialized micro-plastic surgery. Stem cell research has been utilized for some medical problems for a while, but its applications have only recently become useful in the clinical sphere. There will be common applications for certain diseases and conditions such as burns, anti-aging, hematology, cardiac cases, and ophthalmological cases including retina and cornea vitiligo problems. The total amount of investment in healthcare in Turkey has been $58 billion, and the total expenditure much higher.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The higher education arena has seen rapid growth. And with rising demand, the number of state universities and non-profit foundation universities has been increasing, and appears set to see further growth. Turkey implements a central entrance exam for access to higher education. I believe that this system provides equality of opportunity given Turkey's remarkable regional diversity. At 900,000 strong, Turkey has all but reached a quota in terms of high school graduates. However, the number of candidates who sit the exam is at around 2 million. Our studies have shown that 25% of candidates who sit the exam have already registered in a program, but are dissatisfied with it. We are studying ways to alleviate pressure on the system caused by such candidates. Additionally, we are developing policies on alternative models enabling internal transfer systems. Moreover, we are trying to simplify and encourage double major or minor program implementations for the same purpose. In 2013, tuition fees were abolished in Turkey, increasing higher education expenditure, but making further education increasingly popular from a student's perspective.</span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, the country had to quickly cover the gaps that were present and move forward by educating all categories within Turkey. The vocational opportunities in Turkey were insufficient. Upon completing their middle school education, young people were pounding at the doors of university. Turkey did not sufficiently invest in higher education for many years. The main universities then needed many new human resources and new academics. There had to be a fair system for selecting the correct candidates from among the accumulated queues. And with that, a centralized university entrance exam was created. A good and bright medical education can be realized only in adequate medical settings. We have to work on our own staff for inter-service education. We have shifted from the classical style of teaching to interactive and integrative problem-based teaching. Now, with this shift, we are trying to make up for lost time. In classical teaching, the student has to combine all the knowledge and synthesize it. In an integrative system, it is presented as a combination.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Private education here is a little different than what you might see in the US or UK. In Turkey, there are foundation universities as non-profit institutions. Turkey certainly had a need for such universities, as previously the country only had state-funded universities. Foundation universities are important because they bring alternative financial resources and complement higher education. Today, there are 185 universities, nine vocational schools, and two institutions of technology in Turkey, almost 70 of which are foundation-established. This is important because there is healthy competition between the two groups of higher education institutions. We all operate under the same education law governing the university system. The financial source differs, but this gives the foundation-established universities the opportunity to set directional strategies and open colleges and programs that the foundation considers feasible. We aim to educate the future leaders of the sector, solve problems facing Turkey and the wider world, and ensure that our university maintains its prestigious position and is sought after by prospective students.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Foundation universities account for about 7% to 8% of all tertiary education institutions in Turkey. By comparison, in the US this number is roughly 20%. Although public institutions will likely continue to dominate the sector for the foreseeable future, foundation universities have the opportunity to make a special contribution to the sector by creating centers of excellence. Foundation universities typically have stronger connections to domestic industries, which facilitate the placement of skilled graduates in the workforce and the commercialization of scientific discoveries. We believe that creating the freest environment, hiring the best scholars, and promoting interdisciplinary thinking is all that a university can do to compete and excel in the global academic marketplace. Koç University has a proven successful track record for the last 20 years, and currently receives Turkey's second-highest number of research grants from the Turkish government and the EU. Our main goal is to continue generating a high rate of reputable publications and citations to match the record of institutions among the top 100 in the world.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It is due to a combination of the existing economic potential of the country and my willingness to take risks that has helped the brand grow. I wrote to a company in New York asking if there were any Turkish products I could export to them. After this initial success, we then began exporting to Europe. Now, for the last four consecutive years, DESA has been Turkey's largest exporter of leather, leather goods, and leather garments. Approximately 50% of our turnover originates from private label manufacturing for luxury brands and the other 50% originates from DESA-branded retail.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Mavi has played an important role in terms of providing confidence to the brands here to go abroad and be successful, so in that sense we are one of the top few brands that pops up in the minds of customers, consumers, and businessmen in terms of names that have made it outside the domestic market. Since we are a denim-focused company, and the motherland for this is the US, what Mavi has done quite successfully is taken its business straight to the US and Canada first. We went where all the competition was and simply tackled them head on, and we have had great success there with offices for 17 years.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The company began with a retail orientation, but as business grew we began manufacturing before moving on to wholesale. We started distributing our merchandise to over 1,000 stores. However, today, we have reconsidered the wholesale business, as we perceive a greater future in branded jewelry retail. Realizing that the future lay in branded merchandise, we created Altınbaş some 20 years ago. Our concern was, and still is, to protect our brand, which is the most fundamental pledge we can make to buyers, consumers, and end-users. Today, perception comes from the brand, and not the product.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">For more than 50 years we have been involved in the wholesale precious metals business, but at no point did we actually become a household brand name. We were always in the background, and did not attempt to create a prominent reputation for ourselves, which is why we came up with the store concept. Currently, we work with over 2,000 retail outlets in the country and almost 200 jewelry retail outlets in Konya alone. We are conducting market analysis, and if everything goes to plan with this retail store, we foresee a rapid expansion of stores through 2014.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Turkey is becoming an increasingly important retail player, both in terms of attracting international brands and Turkish brands succeeding abroad. Turkey still has a long way to go in terms of brand building, but Beymen, among its luxury brands, is a pioneer in Turkey, dating back to 1971. Today, the brand is well known and recognized worldwide as a luxury, specialist retailer. We have partnerships with over 400 different brands, and are increasingly receiving requests from countries as diverse as Germany, China, and the US. The same can be said for a number of Turkish brands as well, especially in neighboring countries, where we see ever greater numbers of Turkish retailers establishing operations. That said, brand building is one of the key areas that Turkey should continue to work on.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our growth has been double the addressable market in Turkey, which has also been growing at 9% on average. We have grown about 21% annually on average over recent years. With that, Microsoft Turkey's prominence has increased in the Microsoft system. More Microsoft resources have also started coming into the country. Microsoft then started to evaluate different R&amp;D opportunities in Turkey, especially in the education arena. We have already invested in the Koç University R&amp;D center, ATOM, and some other university projects. Also, we have an innovation center in Microsoft Ankara office where we support start-ups with our technologies. We believe that the FATİH project, an initiative to get more technology into public education, also creates R&amp;D opportunities focused on education. With 20 years of experience in Turkey, Microsoft has a strong presence in the country through its partnership network, and currently has around 11,000 technology partners, both small and large.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We consider our business as providing more value to society. That is a key point of the continuation of sustainable business. Sometimes we fail. However, if our businesses add value to society, it is difficult to fail in the long term. This is one of the key factors in the sustainability of our business. I believe that it is one of the main considerations that has enabled Mitsui to continue as it has for 130 years. Our business model has not remained the same throughout our history; we change it on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs of society. We always consider our business decisions in relation to society, so that we can continue to have success. Domestic energy resources are a good example of this. Turkey clearly needs domestic energy; so if we could provide it, our business would be guaranteed.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Turkey is becoming increasingly important for the global automotive business. The Turkish automotive industry fulfills the demand in domestic and export markets. The interest of foreign investors in this sector is increasing continuously. The reason for this is that Turkey has a highly educated and competent workforce, favorable labor costs, solid know-how, and a growing domestic market. This adds up to a promising commercial environment, and we seek to strengthen our position in it. Of course, the labor costs in Turkey aren't as favorable for us as they are in certain Eastern European countries, but the combination of factors like the quality of the workforce, the level of competency, and labor costs makes the environment highly attractive. In the last 10 years, we experienced a very successful period in Turkey driven mainly by the real estate and construction business, and also private consumption, which are the main pillars of growth.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We operate in over 140 countries, but Turkey has long ranked among the top-20 countries for Bayer in sales terms. As a sizable country, it, therefore, holds a prominent position in the Bayer universe. Turkey's greatest opportunity lies in its underlying macro-economic parameters, with demographics being one of the driving factors. The average age of Turkish citizens is 28, which differentiates Turkey substantially from other European countries. The number of people who need access to medicine, therefore, is also growing, which looms large in terms of our healthcare offering. Hence, we support and do business with farmers keen to increase their yield. Turkey is also a major base for the automotive, textile, electronics and construction sector. Bayer's Material Science subgroup is aiming to further grow its market share in these areas to continue to be the primary supplier with its innovative solutions and technical know-how.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have extensive experience in real estate, as well as infrastructure, and I expect both to remain quite active in Turkey. On the real estate front, Turkey has many major developers realizing megaprojects inside and beyond Turkey. We can add value to these as the funding institutions most of the time require independent management to ensure compliance with funding conditions. Prior to this, most developers were funding and constructing their own projects, leveraging their construction arms. Today there are consortiums of developers and investors coming together to create projects. The market dynamics have changed, and when you have different partners you definitely need an objective observer, someone who knows how to report independently and record on progress, as well as ensure the quality that stakeholders expect to get out of the project.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It is our opinion that Turkey would be an important partner for the EU's future growth. Our support includes written statements and, in my opinion, the best plan is to do as much as possible. Practical steps must also be taken, especially when it comes to democracy and human rights. It is best to work closely on such issues and share experiences, thus creating a real human basis for development. Of course, the process of joining the EU is long and complicated, but if we can take certain practical steps it will help in pointing all parties in the right direction. We are open in our opinions, and ready to deal with anything.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I believe that Turkey has been and is an integral part of the European political, economic, and cultural space. Turkey's accession to the EU would definitely add impetus to the European economy. I believe that both the Romanian and Turkish societies would benefit from Turkey's EU membership, and I stand by my September 2013 statements. I would also like to add that the contribution of the Turkish community in Romania to the development of relations between our two countries is paramount. Not only is the Turkish minority one of the cultural landmarks of Romanian culture, but also I believe that, politically speaking, the Turkish community in Romania can act as a bridge between our two countries.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Bosnian and Herzegovinian diaspora in Turkey had become significant by the turn of the 20th century. Many people moved to Turkey, and I think there are clear similarities between both countries. The markets of both countries are also related, and yet no agreement is in place between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey. Turkey is one of the strongest countries in the world. In contrast, Bosnia and Herzegovina is impoverished having suffered through the war of the 1990s, and today needs investment to spur development. We are keen to export a range of products to Turkey including foodstuffs, wood, steel, and military hardware.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are a fairly new company of around one year of age, and are active in all asset classes in Turkey, promoting ourselves as an investment bank. We are active in equity trading, fixed income trading, and foreign exchange markets, as well as corporate finance and asset management. We value our clients, and as a creative and technologically innovative company are geared at creating value for them. In looking to the future, we are keen to offer new value-added products to our clients and the Turkish market. We also have a company in Azerbaijan, which opens up another business window, and we work to create synergy between the two nations both at the retail and corporate level.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our main focus is on performance, and we invest in Turkish assets only. Since May 2013, there have been outflows across emerging markets, both in fixed income and equities, and Turkey has had its share of this, too. Certain geopolitical issues have also had an adverse effect, like the possibility of an intervention in Syria, so Turkish assets underperformed in comparison to other emerging markets between June and September. However, one should also note that Turkish equities and fixed income instruments performed quite well prior to the upgrades to investment grade and before concerns over the Fed's slowing down of asset purchases. Based on our macro outlook on Turkey and our global view, we set long-term investment plans and are an active manager in equities and Turkish fixed income instruments.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">When it comes to asset or wealth management, Turkey is one of the most attractive opportunities globally for a number of reasons. The macroeconomic standing with high interest rates makes investors dedicate all their savings to relatively safe but high-yielding instruments. Secondly, because of the specific aspects, banks usually dominate the wealth management world. There are no financial advisor service providers other than the banks; people look to them because they have no alternative. Thirdly, it is a country where now, more than in other countries, political developments and regulatory changes are supporting the establishment of businesses like ours.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The production of renewable energy is being incentivized. However, while these incentives are a good idea, it will take many years to achieve the end-goal because this industry remains rather undeveloped. The Minister of Energy has said that the domestic target will be extended to at least 2020, because the law stipulates that development is to take place by 2015. If a firm produces electricity after that time, it will not use the domestic tariff. The Minister of Energy's aim for 2023 is 20,000 MW of wind energy. This is a huge goal, and will be realized. However, other branches of government, such as the Ministry of Environment and Forestry consider the target unattainable, and are opposed to the development of forestland. Having said that, it is in Turkey's best interest in terms of development as it plays an increasingly significant role in the world. Turkey, thanks to successful governance, is one of the fastest growing developing economies in the world. At the end of the day, all Turkish citizens stand to benefit, and we have spent much effort to bring about change in this area.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are seeing an overlap between the Nordic experience in hydropower development, establishing liberal markets, and what is happening in Turkey. We see keen interest from the Turkish side in really working on those experiences. The Nordic models have also influenced European counterparts, which is one important reason why it could take place here. The Norwegians are looking for growth opportunities in Turkey, and Turkey is looking to liberalize its market. This is important. You can always sign a memorandum or understanding (MoU), but filling it with content is the real test. We are in the position of engaging in discussions with the relevant parties in Turkey, and as soon as we are officially able to settle on some of the ideas that we have, it will be easy to communicate these. We took immediate steps after the signing of the MoU to move to the next stage in order to achieve concrete results from the MoU because we all agree it is worth little on its own; it is only worth more when it produces something. It is ultimately based on the overlapping interests between us.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Turkey's photovoltaic solar market is growing, because toward the end of 2013 the applications for photovoltaic licenses were opened, whereby companies and individuals became free to apply photovoltaic technology on rooftops and land. Turkey's total capacity for 2013 was at 9 MW PV. It seems to me that an additional 700 MW a year has to be installed per annum to reach this target by 2023. This represents considerable potential, and we now need to educate the public on photovoltaic and rooftop facility applications, as electricity consumption is high and prices are rising. The country's economic situation is unstable, as is the currency, while the cost of imported energy is volatile and on a rising trajectory. Clearly the solution lies in renewables. The country has to produce its own energy, which includes industry and households.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In our business, logistics are important, because we are delivering a lot of volume. One container is 1 cubic meter, and we can fit 65 pieces in one container. Another key issue is the cost of manpower. In Europe, Turkey has about the same manpower costs as Poland, but with better worker quality. Today in Poland, we have five factories, with manpower costs increasing rapidly, whereas in Turkey the rate is stable. In Turkey, there is also a stronger brand loyalty. This loyalty affects productivity and efficiency. The market is another important consideration for us, as we are producing and also selling in Turkey. We have had a plant here for 20 years. The reason we have a cooling factory is that refrigerators take more time in production. If we produce one refrigerator in Turkey today, we have to pay between ‚¬6 and ‚¬12 in manpower costs. If you manufacture the same product in France, one hour will cost ‚¬20. The weighted average for the economy is 2% now, with training.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Henkel has three different business areas that it concentrates on. These are adhesive technologies, laundry and home care, and beauty care. Henkel was one of the first multinationals to realize Turkey's potential. We were quite fast coming into Turkey. It was important for us because of the size of the market and the growth potential we found here. Each move we make into a new market is based on the respective size and growth potential there. Currently, we have three factories in Turkey. Two are located close to Istanbul in Gebze and Tuzla, and both deal with adhesive technologies. Our third factory is in Ankara, and it is Henkel's second largest factory in the world for laundry and homecare after our factory in Düsseldorf.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Turkish market is probably going to remain stable. We are the world's leading manufacturer of pressure vessel storage for all types of gasses. We are not only dependent on the Turkish economy. If we were a 100% Turkish-owned business, I'd be a little bit less optimistic, because there are a lot of headwinds; inflation is moving up and the Turkish lira has devalued a little, which is causing a lot of pressure on local companies. It is especially hitting those that sell in Turkey, but source their raw materials from abroad. We will attempt to grow this business as efficiently and as quickly as we can. We have a unique opportunity here for a cost-effective manufacturing base. From Bandırma, where we will build a 50,000-sqm facility, we will have easy port access to Izmir or Bursa. Phase I will be about 33,000 sqm, which will be about double the space that we have from a manufacturing perspective.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In terms of education, we have great integration with Europe, where many students join the Erasmus program and spend six months or a year in Western Europe. I would say that more European companies should look to Turkey, instead of looking at distant countries such as India, China, or Southeast Asia. From a cultural and educational perspective, and considering prospects for EU accession, Turkey is a good place for investment. Many companies have profited from such previous investments, including Ericsson, Microsoft, and Oracle, and they have major regional offices based out of Istanbul. It is a win-win situation for these companies to invest in Turkey. We have a huge market in Turkey, and the B2C area is already consolidated. We have E-Bay, Amazon, and private equity companies already invested in large players in the country. The next waves of investment and growth are going to come from the B2B side.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In terms of technology, Turkey has to cover quite a bit of ground in internet penetration, improving services, and transitioning into an innovation society. ICT spending is still relatively low at around 3.5% of GDP. The FATİH education project is a good example—smart boards and wireless tablets coupled with content for collaborative learning will transform the way we learn and support innovation. Established in 1997, Cisco in Turkey has been doing well and growing steadily, well in excess of Turkey's GDP. We address the needs of enterprises, SMBs, the public sector, and service providers through a network of over 600 business partners. They are certified in Cisco technologies, create solutions to address customer challenges, and our top partners undertake the largest ICT projects in the country. Over the years, we have also established 140 plus Cisco Networking Academies in Turkey with close to 10,000 students in attendance today. Cisco expects to invest over $1 billion to build its expanded cloud business over the next two years.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have been active in Turkey since 1985. The company changed its name to Motorola Solutions, and we are focusing on two areas that depend on our product portfolio: government and enterprise. We did well in both areas in 2013 and achieved all of our goals and targets. For our enterprise portfolio, we have tablets and handheld terminals, and over 185 dealers working with two distributors. The government portfolio primarily involves the radio business, and we have over a 50% market share on both sides, so we are a market leader in Turkey and around the world. Moreover, we are pursuing public safety communication projects for the Ministry of Transport, which is working on a nationwide digital radio system. From a sales and technology perspective, we have 50% more staff than our competitors. As Turkey is one of the largest countries in the region, depending on consumer and government expectations, we may have a local assembly unit in Turkey to serve the region.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Turkey has a significant proposition; it is the second or third economy following China in growth terms, and by 2023 aims to rank among the top-10 economies in the world. Xerox has realized this opportunity and decided to increase its focus on the country because these countries, while not necessarily offering a large population or GDP, are nonetheless high-potential markets. When you talk about services in a country like Turkey, which has a large population with an average age of 28 years, and which is highly educated, the services side offers huge potential for the future. Transportation, HR, and IT services are the main areas where we are poised to experience commercial growth. Essentially, when compared to developed markets, the services business remains at the very early stage of development. Xerox's acquisition of ACS in 2010 with its 75,000 employees at a cost of $6.4 billion was a major step.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I still believe there might be commercial gas potential in the Black Sea offshore sector of Turkey. Therefore, new exploration activities and investment by international major oil companies should continue together with the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO). There is currently limited offshore gas production in the Western Black Sea. However, Shell and TPAO recently signed an agreement and could shortly commence drilling in a concession located in the Western Black Sea offshore sector. The Gulf of Antalya might be also interesting with respect to oil and gas exploration, regarding which TPAO and Shell have signed a joint venture exploration agreement. Following commercial gas discoveries in the offshore sector of Israel, the Eastern Mediterranean seems another potential region for oil and gas exploration activities. In the Turkish sector, TPAO has opted to farm-out for partners, preferably majors, to carry out exploration activities.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We first started importing natural gas in 2009, and have been experiencing growth over the past year. Our first contract, from a BOTAÅž release program, was for a very small annual volume of just 750 million cubic meters (mcm). In 2013, we increased that volume by adding a further two contracts, and today import 2.5 billion cubic meters (bcm) of Russian gas. We have another ongoing application for the import of Kazakhstani gas. That will bring our annual total to about 3.25 bcm. Our main aim is to find the best solutions to supply Turkey with natural gas from diverse sources and via all routes, while being involved in the entire natural gas value chain. Unfortunately, there are not too many options in terms of importing natural gas into Turkey. However, we are pursuing all available avenues in order to increase the amount of natural gas entering Turkey to supply the Turkish market and serve our customers.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Turkey has been trying to liberalize its energy market since 2001. It all started with the enactment of the Electricity Market Law No. 4628, Natural Gas Market Law No. 4646 and the establishment of the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA). Then, it continued with the opening up of the market to independent, emerging new power plants and the privatization of gas distribution regions. These are all very positive developments. But on the other hand, the privatization of the generation assets remains to be completed. Additionally, the government has yet to complete the unbundling of all transmission activities and the release of BOTAÅž's existing gas import contracts to private companies, as well as establishing the energy exchange in Turkey. It is not possible to have a liberalized electricity market without a fully liberalized natural gas market. As long as the government has the ability to control prices and maintains cross-subsidization, the market's behavior cannot improve.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are conducting thorough market research to understand ICT investment opportunities in new sectors, such as oil and gas, transportation, finance, telecoms, and the media. In the future, we see Malomatia expanding its services into different sectors, and the priority is to begin in 2014, starting with the oil and gas and transportation sectors. Those sectors have been confirmed, but we may have others besides. One area where we see Malomatia growing is in the field of cyber security. We foresee huge demand in Qatar for this service, and are investing in building local cyber-security practices and capabilities. Malomatia is positioned as an IT services and consulting company; we do not sell hardware infrastructure or software, and we are not a software development company. The Qatari IT services market is currently worth an estimated $1 billion. Even capturing one percentage point of the market would be a great achievement for the company. We also envisage this market growing to $1.6 billion by 2017. Malomatia will continue to work closely with its clients to understand the priorities in order to capture the majority market share of IT services and to become the partner of choice when it comes IT integration and consulting services. One of the greatest offerings that we see being required over the next five years in Qatar is managed operations outsourcing, which will become a huge challenge across all industries; it is not sector specific.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Qatar’s vision for 2030 has four pillars. One of those is economic development and developing a knowledge-based economy. The goal is now to diversify away from the oil and gas sector to other industries. This is driven by the vision of His Highness the Emir. Today, Qatar is investing heavily to diversify its economic matrix. The ICT sector is led by ictQATAR as the regulator, and it has established different operators to enable the ICT sector and to promote its agenda, which in the end will meet the Qatar National Vision 2030. The country’s ICT sector is mainly comprised of Es’hailSat, Qatar National Broadband, as well as the telecoms operators. Five years ago, there was only one operator, but today there are several, which is a testament to Qatar’s desire to open up the market and promote economic diversification. Diversification needs to be considered seriously because oil and gas are finite raw materials, and every country needs an economic backup plan. In Qatar, we have the ICT sector and the sports sectors, which today is not only about the World Cup but also investments. We also have the tourism sector, which has projects and investment diversification opportunities.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Qnbn aims at having the maximum nationwide coverage to enable connectivity in the country. By doing so, service providers will be able to connect end users to the infrastructure, enabling them to communicate efficiently and effectively. Fiber optics allow the seamless transfer of data and offers both operators and enterprises the fastest possible internet access. The Qnbn network will allow communication speeds of multiple Gbps; hence, the opportunities are endless and the effect is truly transformative. New residents and businesses coming from technologically advanced countries have high expectations when it comes to high—speed broadband connections, and Qatar is ready to meet this demand, especially in light of the massive growth fuelled by construction, the 2022 FIFA World Cup, rail and infrastructure projects, e-health, e-government, and the focus on sustainable mega projects. In order to have a facilitated communications platform, Qnbn is building an advanced ICT infrastructure, while meeting the regulatory requirements of the construction, telecom, and government sectors. As per the ictQATAR report, there is an opportunity to improve and further integrate ICT skills between the workforce and the e-education system and to improve digital literacy. The fiber-optic network will be a driving force in accelerating ICT adoption in education, healthcare, and businesses, as well as in implementing programs to enhance e-skills.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Qatari construction sector has vast potential. Here in Qatar, very few projects were halted for financial reasons as a result of the crisis; the market has been left relatively untouched. There is demand for villas, residential tower blocks, and commercial office space. Qatar is a highly domesticated market in the sense that the entire structure of business here is geared toward people that are set-up or established in this country, rather than people who fly in and fly out. The primary challenges are based around the body of work required to be executed over the next five to 10 years, and whether that can be achieved given the finite amount of resources and level of constraint in the market. Over the next 12 months, we will see significant bidding for a limited volume of projects.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I believe that the bulk part of the major construction projects here in Doha city will be completed. However, Qatar is going to face an increasing infrastructure need in order to develop other areas such as Al Khor, Al Waqra, Medinat Shimal, and Al Dukhan. the construction industry is set to remain on a growth trend for the next 10 years, at the very minimum. Since Qatar became a major business destination, we have decided to look for investment opportunities and expand our business. New companies are coming to Doha daily, attracted by its rapid development and stable market. We would like to feature in the development of Qatar, not only in construction, but also in areas such as transportation and the services sector.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In general, setting up a business in Qatar is quite difficult for foreign companies because, even though the potential of winning business is there, one has to overcome many bureaucratic hurdles, and the rules change all the time. If you want to win a project in Qatar, you have to invest in not only the office, but also in people and costs, and be ready for the fact that you will not be able to win anything for at least one year. This requires a huge investment, often upwards of $1 million. We formally entered the Qatari market in 1999, and many years before this we had conducted a feasibility study here to see whether we could produce cement. We have been successful, having completed $1.2 billion worth of projects in Qatar—nine projects in total. We expect 2014 to be a great year for the Qatari construction sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Entering the Qatari market is difficult; if you are a brand name, it is easier. However, for less established firms, it can be challenging. Employers here value security highly, and prefer to pay more for a contractor with a record in the market, rather than opt for a cheaper alternative with no experience in Qatar. We have the capacity, and use it effectively, efficiently, and profitably. We do not want to exceed our capacity, because I don’t believe that signing onto 20 jobs from every country is effective. Nonetheless, we are expecting a boom in Qatar, and feel that our possibilities here and in the UAE and Oman will prove sufficient.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Currently, the market is promising more than it is delivering. We are still waiting to see many upcoming infrastructure, property, and building commitments. The most important milestone coming up will be the awarding of the Doha Metro contracts. The first pressure point will be the supply chain, and keeping goods, labor, and materials flowing through to work phases. It is possible that the capital supply chain will find it difficult to cope; even now most players in the infrastructure or property market here are finding the cash flow slow. GHD has been involved in some of the major building developments in Qatar, such as the old and new airports, Khalifa Stadium, and various hotels and highrises.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Qatar seeks to educate its nationals with targeted education programs that have been handpicked from similar programs abroad. There is a great deal of interest from the University of Calgary to partner with us and thereby access research funding from the Qatar Foundation (QF). In the summer of 2012, we appointed an associate dean of research and with a full research office. We have just recently opened a Master of Nursing program, and we are going to be expanding it to include a research-based program, as the school has access to $2.8 million in research funding from QF. If we are going to grow in any direction, it is going to be in the area of research. There has been talk of a new building for UCQ that could be built in Medical City, which is close to Hamad Medical Center, and which would be ideal for us. We now have 338 students, but our goal is to reach the 1,000 student mark.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Cultivating a research culture is a very important foundation for developing Qatar’s knowledge-based society. Carnegie Mellon has been conducting cutting-edge research that has real-world applications for more than 100 years. Both student and faculty researchers at Carnegie Mellon Qatar are actively engaged in developing the technology of tomorrow, and the research that is undertaken in Qatar is very much tied to the needs of this region. Some of our research areas include cloud computing, education, robotics, Arabic language technologies, business process design, innovation-driven entrepreneurship, next-generation wireless networks, and information security. Carnegie Mellon offers five of its top undergraduate programs in Qatar: Biological Sciences, Business Administration, Computational Biology, Computer Science, and Information Systems. Since joining Education City in 2004, we have graduated 300 young men and women, more than 90% of who have been recruited by top companies, including Google, HSBC, Microsoft, Qatar Petroleum, and Sidra Medical Research Center.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The partnership between Qatar Foundation (QFv) and HEC Paris has created synergies between Qatar and France’s foremost institutions that are focused on education and scientific research. For example, based on local and regional demand, we decided in 2012 to launch the Specialized Master’s degree in Strategic Business Unit Management that is aimed at junior managers and high potential professionals. On the other hand, our Executive MBA program is exactly the same as the one offered in other HEC locations around the world. One of the majors offered within the framework of the EMBA is the Energy major. It consists of two sessions, one taking place in Paris and one in Doha, that is the perfect location for the energy specialization of our degree. Qatar has huge potential and a promising future ahead, with opportunities for business and career growth abundant.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are currently the only institution in Qatar that has been awarded the contract to train and educate tour guides: if they do not follow our program and pass our exam, they do not become licensed guides and cannot work as such. We are professionally focused on our undergraduate programs, and our library resources are not what they would be in a research-focused university. With the Qatar Nation Library, access to the latest information is not a problem for our students. We practice an interweaving of practical learning with theory, whereby our first-year students have to carry out hotel operational tasks, irrespective of their course of studies. We are targeting companies that see the value in having bright young minds augment their existing staff in developing innovative solutions to real world problems. Qatari students form the largest group at Stenden University Qatar. Yet high diversity creates an environment within which our students out of necessity are working with colleagues from different cultures.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our alumni will be leading the future of Qatar’s cultural and creative professions, as well as participating in the global challenges identified as key to the region’s future. We have alumni working with the Qatar Museums Authority, Mathaf, Museum of Islamic Art, Al Jazeera, Fitch, Qatari Diar, Qatar Foundation Capital Projects, and various ministries. We opened in 1998 as the Shaqab College of Design Arts offering degree programs in graphic, fashion, and interior design. The first program we added to the initial three was a BFA in painting and printmaking. We have also started a Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) program in design studies. In 2012, we welcomed the first group of students into the new BA in Art History program, and we look forward to preparing the first art historians from within the country to step into significant positions in the new galleries, museums, and cultural institutions in Qatar and the region.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">At the moment, there is a shortage of places in schools, which is a stumbling block for the National Vision. The vision will be achieved, but this is one of the things currently slowing it down. There are private investment models in which companies try to establish a school and then generate a profit from it. In contrast, we are a non-profit organization, and what we generate from school fees is invested back into the school; we focus on the quality of the education. We have around 10%-12% Qatari students, and 50% British, while 55 other nationalities make up the remainder. Within the next three years, the school will be converted to complete-tablet technology.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The knowledge economy has today been recognized as a business opportunity. Many professionals from all over the world are moving to Qatar, and need school places for their children. There is massive investment on the part of the Qatari authorities, both for their own nationals and also for expatriates who are helping to expand the country’s infrastructure. Currently, 70 schools are being built for Qatar’s nationals. International schools can be guaranteed student numbers as there is a huge undersupply of good schools. We have just built a new extension to the school, which has enabled us to take in about 150 more students, but that is already full. ISL Qatar is one of the first private international schools in Qatar that was not sponsored by an embassy, and 80% of our 870 students are international.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Qatari education sector has really changed and evolved. The leadership within the education sector is different today, as it comprises well-educated professionals. The Ministry of Education has become the Supreme Education Council. The government covers tuition for all Qataris, and is keen to promote learning for all its citizens, while meeting the educational needs and aspirations of all Qataris and expatriates. We have branches of the world’s best schools and universities in the country. Today, we have students from 60 different nations studying together. We aim to be one of the top schools in Qatar, and we also hope to open a new branch in Lusail, with construction scheduled to begin in 2014.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government handles about 60% of the pharmaceutical market, with the remaining 40% handled by the private sector. The Qatari pharmaceutical sector is worth $390 million as of 2012, with an annual growth forecast of 15%-16% in the next five years. The main driving force for growth in this sector, and indeed all sectors, is the 2022 FIFA World Cup, for which there are huge government infrastructure investments in all sectors, particularly in education and healthcare. Outside of Qatar, Saudi Arabian contractors dominate the healthcare sector in the Gulf region, with about 45%-48% of the market, whereas Qatar only has a 4.5% share of the total pharmaceutical market. However, this should grow significantly. A huge budget has already been approved by their excellencies Sheikh Hamad and Sheikh Tamim, at about QAR300 billion, which also includes a special fund for health and education.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are one of the only two medical devices manufacturers in Qatar, and there are just three or four in the GCC. Similar to many other segments in Qatar, the industry has a lot of room to grow. As part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, investments were directed toward building the capacity of the Hamad Medical Corporation and also establishing state-of-the-art hospitals in locations such as Sidra. In the Qatari healthcare market, Hamad Medical Corporation is the primary buyer of healthcare goods, purchasing around 80% to 90% of the supply. Since there is very little manufacturing in Qatar, it buys most of its products from abroad. Noting this demand gap, I expect to see more healthcare players establish operations in Qatar to cater to the market’s need. We will see more local players in the market because Qatar is in an ever-expanding economic phase, along with its population. As the population increases and purchasing power rises, spending on healthcare will also continue to grow.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In Qatar, the pharmaceutical industry and medical devices industry is a new area. We mainly supply Hamad Medical Corporation. We expect the new compulsory insurance law to affect us by creating demand for medicine and boosting both the market in general and our sales in particular. Currently, Qatar is producing about 10% of the GCC’s medicine needs. We will try to gain a greater share of the medicine market, which is worth $6 billion in total. In the GCC, there is a tender process, as all GCC members buy from the Central Health Ministry in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. In 2013, we won around 65 tenders. New legislation regarding foreign companies operating in the medical sector here will bring about a positive change for the market. Having already invested approximately QAR400 million, we also have a number of new products that are currently in the registration process. Also, we are trying to patent some products.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">More than 34 nationalities can enter Qatar without a visa, which encourages tourism further still. Qatar is focused on developing tourism, and we want people to enjoy the development of the city, downtown, and the new Corniche. Our emphasis is more on heritage and values. What makes us unique is the combination of authentic collections in a modern mix; it is Qatari interior design. We are the first hotel operator in Qatar to own and manage such facilities at a very high standard. The whole philosophy is to be part of Souq Waqif, which in turn is a part of us. In our case, the individual hotel names, such as at Jasra or Najada, have historical significance. That, in itself, promotes international heritage. I think people really need to experience the journey from a totally different angle to what they are used to in the region. When you visit the city of Doha, you see the signature of the city. It stays faithful to its origins, which no longer easy to find in the region.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The tourism sector here in Doha has experienced steady growth. When you consider the economic climate of Qatar, you note double-digit growth, which is expected to continue over the coming years. What we have seen is that more and more businesses or companies that had been present in the region—going mostly to Dubai and Abu Dhabi—are now being attracted to Qatar. The MICE sector will be a focus for Doha and Qatar, as well as our focus for the future. I always say there is no such thing as an over-saturated market if you have the right business model. Looking at our hotel, and especially the Ritz Carlton, we are not selling beds; we are not selling rooms and food in the restaurant. What the Ritz Carlton stands for is the experience. In combination with Qatar Airways and the Qatar Tourism Association, we have a strong presence here with our two hotels.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">If you take 2012 as a benchmark, it is fair to say that over the past 10 years Qatar has been a business-driven city. It was never perceived as a leisure or weekend destination. The Qatar Tourism Authority (QTA) has done a fantastic job. We see a lot of activities in Doha now, and an increasing proportion of the guests in our hotel come for the weekend or as tourists. The Ritz-Carlton, Doha, in particular, has always been a MICE hotel. The new Qatar National Convention Centre (QNCC), opened in 2012, and the ballroom are unbelievable. Now we can hold citywide conferences. Our owners are investing in a massive three-year renovation project for the hotel, starting in late 2013. We are adding four additional food and beverage outlets as well as a convention center. There will be an extension of the spa and renovated rooms. The potential for growth in the country is so tremendous that this investment is necessary in the lead up to the World Cup.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The exhibitions and conferences the government is bringing to Doha are supporting us tremendously. This hotel was based on the MICE business and the needs of corporate travelers. In 2012, the environmental conference was a major success with more than 20,000 delegates. More and more worldwide and regional conferences are coming to the country. In Doha, there was already the Sheraton and W, but we came in to add to the flavor of the hotel portfolio. We cater to all, but we are appreciated the most by the people who know our brand from elsewhere. We have 336 rooms, 70 suites, a ballroom, and a 4,000 sqm conference facility that can cater for 1,200 people. Our goal is to penetrate new feeder markets, and for this reason we employ Chinese, French, and English butlers.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our idea is to build something different in terms of a design and a landmark for the community, and we felt that classic architectural beauty could last for years, in contrast to the gamble of pursuing the shock of the new. I like to add a soul and strong character to our malls, and we also like to focus attention on the provision of a fine-dining experience. This is something that is missing at the moment in Qatar. There are many casual, fast food, and American brands, but very few European and finer food offerings. We have an excellent location here, being close to major road infrastructure and The Pearl, and are at the heart of the future development of the city.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There is considerable retail activity emerging across Qatar. Some retailers are catering to low-income customers, and others to the high-end. We target middle- and high-income individuals. We started from an 8,000-sqm department store, to which we attached a shopping center, The Gate, as part of the Salam Group. We are attracting customers by introducing modern, younger, and teenager-focused products. Many new malls are opening, but I honestly do not feel they have the right identity. Our brand name, and dedicated staff, some of who scour the world for new appealing products, help us create something unique here. In perfume and cosmetics, we represent 60% of the total distribution in the market and 40% of the retail. Qatar accounts for 60% of our group’s business at a regional level.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Doha, at the time of the Festival City’s inception, was lacking a truly international standard retail mall; that is to say, a large super regional retail mall of this proposed standard. We have conducted considerable research into the demographics of Qatar, which is changing. It is no longer feasible to build luxury-only type retail offerings. In terms of price points and so forth, we are targeting across the range from luxury to just below mid-range. The quality of our offering is unrivalled in the region, and our sheer size is another unique selling point. It is by far the largest retail offering in Qatar with 250,000 sqm of leasable space. DHFC will offer a vast amount of entertainment, with internal and external entertainment spaces fully integrated with the mall, and this is going to be the real differentiator—something not seen before in the rest of the Gulf.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">ABB in Qatar was formed locally in 2005 in partnership with the Hawar Group. Since then, local staff numbers have multiplied by more than 40 times and continue to grow with 260 ABB employees today. ABB has a long-term commitment to Qatar and is proud to contribute to the country’s present and future development. With our technology leadership, global presence, and local expertise, we offer products, systems, solutions, and services that meet customer needs related to energy consumption for cooling, desalinization, and sustainability. A positive thing here is that Qatar targets high-quality products. This is a good fit for ABB. There is a lot of investment in several projects here, which also means that everyone is interested in this market, so the competition is fierce. It is a very interesting market, and it is a pleasure to be here because of the pace of development. ABB always tries to be a local company. Our target is to grow together with the market, and also look at projects and investments that make sense where we can really support Qatar’s vision for 2030. We really want to be the company that is giving the best customer support in Qatar, and our business and people programs in place today will ensure we deliver on those promises.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Qatar’s LNG business has helped globalize the industry. This is in part due to our ability to scale-up the LNG trains, but also is a result of revolutions in the LNG shipping business. Our LNG trains in Qatar have tripled in size since the initial days, and the amount of gas that we can ship has also increased substantially with the introduction of the Q-Flex and Q-Max carriers. The Q-Max, for example, is approximately 80% larger than the conventional LNG ships of the past. These advancements, pioneered as part of Qatar’s LNG business, impact the industry as a whole with the introduction of additional LNG consumers into the market that were previously difficult to reach. These new customers add another layer to our global business, as ExxonMobil has operations—and hence solid relationships—across the global energy sector in many of the countries that now receive gas from Qatar. It goes without saying that our asset base in this country is very important to us, as are the relationships that come with it.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The ICT market today is growing in double digits, and Qatar is one of the few countries with growth at this pace. The government wants to bring the ICT contribution to GDP from close to 1% to 3% or 4% over the next few years. From that perspective alone, it is a growth market, and Microsoft, being one of the largest ICT players, is also investing in this area. We are primarily focusing on people, and have tripled our staff over the past three years. We have also tripled our capacity-building investment in the market. This is important because Microsoft works in a particular partner ecosystem wherein we sell our products to partners who take out product-built solutions and deliver them to the market. We have fewer than 100 people in the office, but we have almost 3,000 people working in the Microsoft environment. Part of what we are doing is investing in the capacity and capability of our partners so they can better serve our clients, be that for government systems, other IT solutions for companies, or Xboxes for your average individual customer. Additionally, we are investing in what we call “business innovation.“ We try to encourage young people to use technology to be creative, but also to help the SME ecosystem grow beyond the borders of Qatar.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Total is one of the top five companies in the world, with cutting-edge technology and a worldwide outreach in more than 130 countries. We are a very international company in the sense that most of our staff members are not French. What we have in common with our partners and competitors is probably more important than our differences. Still, there are some interesting differences in the way we view the world. In terms of marketing, this certainly brings us a good understanding of the European market, and this is important for Qatargas. Also, the way we do business is perhaps somewhat different. Then, obviously, there is a special relationship between France and Qatar, and, in particular, between Total itself and the country, given that we have been here continuously for 77 years, having together forged a remarkable history. We were the first international oil company to help Qatar develop the North Field, the first to join Qatargas, and the first to enter the petrochemical industry—a driving force behind Dolphin—while our discovery of Al Khalij was the first major find in 30 years.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Dolphin Gas Project has impacted Qatar, the UAE, and Oman, and supported industrial growth and development, although the biggest impact has been on the UAE, where it meets 30% of the country’s energy requirements. However, with a strong track record in community outreach, Dolphin Energy has also played a key role in societal growth and development. Nowhere can this be seen more strongly than in Qatar. The company is a keen supporter of the Qatar National Vision 2030, and the opportunities it offers to drive economic development, environmental stewardship, and societal wellbeing. There is an agreement with Qatar that covers natural gas supply for a period of 25 years. This agreement obliges us to deliver 2 billion standard cubic feet per day to the UAE and Oman, not including liquids. The strategy is to maintain supply reliably and safely because this is essential to both countries and to our customers. We are, in a sense, responsible for energy generation, so you can imagine how important it is to provide uninterrupted supply. We have a good relationship with all the institutions, particularly Qatar University and Texas A&amp;M University. It is critical we support these institutions—Dolphin Energy requires highly skilled engineers and these universities provide the caliber that we need. We are currently focusing on recruiting Qatari graduates in order to increase the Qatarization level, currently at 32%.</span></p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Chiyoda has detailed engineering experience and a capability to grasp the technical requirements of existing plants, and applies this knowledge to ensure they continue to run at optimum capacity, as well as continually upgrade and improve to meet our clients’ needs. We also carry out the full procurement of all required piping, equipment, and construction. Our clients come to us with concerns and requirements when a particular part of the plant is not working at full capacity or requires technical improvement, and we review the project and deliver the full engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM) solution. RasGas and Qatargas are the key companies for LNG production in Qatar, although we also maintain close relationships through long-term engineering or EPCM contracts with many other companies.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Gulf Drilling International (GDI) started with one rig, Al-Doha, in 2004. Since then, we have expanded our share in onshore and offshore drilling markets in Qatar. We have also expanded into the accommodation and liftboat business. We have gone from one offshore jack-up rig, at start-up, to six jack-up rigs, six onshore rigs, one accommodation barge, and one liftboat. The number of rigs will shortly increase, and we will have two more jack-ups over the next 12 months. I would argue that we have done well in our first decade. We originally had a small office with about 100 staff, but today employ more than 1,200 staff. Globally, drilling is in an upward cycle. We have been fortunate to have our new rigs launching from at a time when demand is good.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">What we do here is energy and petrochemicals service contracting. We provide industrial services to the petrochemical industry, which involves plant turnaround and complete shutdowns, as well as engineering, fabrication, and construction. We can build tanks, processing units, equipment for processing units, supply maintenance, and service contracts to existing clients. We provide services for maintenance, repair, and rebuilding, plus valve overhauling. This basically encompasses all we do in the oil and gas sector. Voith enjoys a very good name in Europe. I think that when compared with many local companies that have been around for a while, a new entrant with a reputation like ours attracts positive attention. Qatar is basically a springboard to the rest of the Gulf for us.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Brunel Energy launched its Qatar operations in 2001 with a small contract. We later landed a couple of maintenance contracts for the secondment of technicians and supervisors with Qatargas and RasGas employing about 25-40 people on a three-year contract. Since then, Brunel Energy has expanded considerably. Our revenues were close to QAR7 million initially; however, in 2012, we closed at about QAR85 million. Our expertise lies in finding the right people and providing them to the energy industry. We work with global companies like ExxonMobil, Shell, Total, and GDF SUEZ.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Besides the obvious language and cultural difference that is uniquely Mocambican—Hollard Moçambique has had to provide solutions across a broad spectrum of general insurance and life assurance offerings. We do this through two licences, namely Hollard Seguros (short term) and Hollard Vida (life). These offerings range from engineering and multi-faceted assets and commercial policies to individual motor and homeowner cover to personal accident, group life, funeral, and health. The facts are that from a low base at this stage the insurance sector in Mozambique is, by any standards, defined as small. Total gross premium income figures, including life and short term, are reported to be around the $150 million to $200 million mark. The market is under insured and predominantly commercial and corporate in its nature, riding on the back of new investments in the country. We have had to adapt to the situation, which does make us in some ways different from our sister companies elsewhere. We have developed a successful composite insurance and life assurance model, and we see ourselves in the short and medium term following the same model.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Group life and life insurance for companies have been positive. These account for 90% of our business. On the other hand, the individual life segment has been a challenge. We have pursued a robust program of promotion and sales; however, the uptake has been lower than anticipated. Still, we are not too surprised by this, as it is just our first year and we believe we have to educate people more on the issue—not just the clients, but also those who sell the products, because we sell through agencies on a commission basis. To help facilitate this, we try to simplify our product offering. If you approach people with a complicated product and a complex calculation of interest over what you’re going to get over the next 10 years, clients tend not to buy into it. Instead, we came up with a product that is sold with coupons. You just go in, fill in the details, and buy it. We are trying to simplify our individual life sales. By its very nature, group insurance will always be a larger activity. A group life policy can give you $500,000 in net cash, whereas individual life would only give you $500. Therefore, the balance will ideally be 85% group life and 15% individual life, in income terms. But in terms of clients, we would like to have more in the individual life than the group life component.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Indico Seguros entered the insurance sector in July 2011, launching operations in September of that year. The following year, 2012, was a difficult and ultimately formative one for Indico Seguros, as we had to establish the company culture, mission, and vision, and then follow it through. Nevertheless, we posted a profit in our first full financial year, which is rather unique. We now have a budget of $6 million, and have registered 142% growth in 2013. We are passionate about what we are doing, and always make sure this reflects to our clients. We started off by providing an excellent service, rather than focusing on low prices. In fact, we received an award in France in 2012 for our commitment to quality; we were further awarded for excellence in New York, and again in London by the European Society for Quality Research. In 2013, we were named in the Super Brands Mozambique 2014 awards. We also received the “Made in Mozambique“ seal in confirmation of the fact that we comply with set standards of quality and professional conduct.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I realized there was huge potential in this market; however, we lacked the capacity, and still have a shortfall in our existing production lines. I persuaded the board to approve a total capital expenditure of $170 million on the upgrade of our facilities. This is a substantial amount for a company of our scale. Yet it all comes down to Mozambique’s perceived huge potential. Mozambique has a GDP growth rate of 7%, the largest gas reserves after Qatar, as well as oil and coal, and many other natural resources. The government has stabilized the currency and Mozambique is a relatively stable country for the continent. The potential and stability of the economy, the proximity to South Africa, and the similarities between South Africa and Mozambique have all made it quite a comfortable fit. Our business is all about distribution and Mozambique is a vast country. There is a 2,500 kilometer coastline, and there are distances between major urban areas of thousands of kilometers. Therefore, we selected strategic locations and then developed greenfield sites for three well-positioned factories.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The local market has evolved and consumers are changing. We therefore need the right products at the right price, and try to follow trends in Mozambique as the customer becomes increasingly sophisticated. We are focused on introducing the right product to the market in line with affordability and market dynamics in terms of position, consumer demand, and consumption. This is where we are now focused. We must leverage the strength of our brand and present the right portfolio in the three main sectors. There is a clear rise of the middle class, and as a result the sales of certain are starting to take off. Considerable investment is coming in, and arrivals mean that product consumer habits continue to change as the population becomes increasingly informed and sophisticated about what is available. Agriculture also plays a role in creating stability and sustainability for the future of this country because, one day, natural resources will be exhausted. This is broadening the range of FMCGs available.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Here in Mozambique, we run  a cost-effective operation that over the years has been driven by a highly robust investment strategy. This has enabled us to produce reasonably affordable cigarettes of high quality. The investment climate here has been favorable, too, in contrast to neighboring Angola, although Mozambique it is much more rigid in terms of fiscal and legal structuring. Meanwhile, we have become a dominant player, with a market share nexus of 90%. Today in Mozambique we operate one plant with a capacity of 3.5 billion cigarettes. We estimate the Mozambican cigarette market to be at just slightly over 3 billion, and the existing plant is geared exclusively to domestic supply. Approximately 95% of my portfolio is produced right here, while the remaining 5%, comprising premium brands, is purchased from South Africa. We are largely self-sufficient in terms of production for the domestic market. Given our proximity to South Africa, and South Africa’s position within the southern market, a part of our role is to safeguard South Africa where illicit products are a major problem, as with several countries surrounding South Africa.</span></p>]]></sections21>

Mozambique was on a development path, and Visabeira identified an opportunity to combine the market with the country’s capacities. When Visabeira decided to operate in what was a virgin market, we used our competencies to meet the market’s demands of that time, where few other companies were able to do so. Today, many companies are coming here to take advantage of existing opportunities, but at that time we considered ourselves to be pioneers. Importantly, we believed in the true potential of the market, and identified its opportunities. Our group understood this 22 years ago, and today this is a market that relies on our know-how.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our strategic expansion into Mozambique was based on the unique nature of the country, blessed as it is with very rich mineral resources, a growing economy, and a highly stable and well-run government. Since investment will only go to where it feels welcome, we intend to carry out many long-term investments in the country because of the business opportunities available and the solid governance enjoyed by the country. We celebrated our third anniversary in the country at the end of 2013, and currently have two branches in Maputo, while a third one will open shortly in Nampula. We have recruited and trained staff for this new branch. Our primary focus is corporate and commercial banking, while also reaching out to retail banking, mainly through our e-banking channel. Our business philosophy entrenches value-chain banking.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Siemens has been present in Mozambique for around 60 years. We built the railway to South Africa, the pylons for the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Project, and the HVDC solution that delivers power to South Africa. Siemens was present in the country before anyone even began to talk about gas and coal. We have been supporting Mozambique in terms of energy, education, and healthcare for decades. Mozambique is a very important country for Siemens, and a key market in our growth strategy. Indeed, in 2013 we received a visit from the executive management in Germany underlining the importance given to this market. As a company, Siemens sees many growth opportunities in Mozambique. With the opening of our new branch office in 2013, we are gearing up for continued expansion.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are in a window of opportunity in Mozambique right now in the telecommunications sector, and cannot miss this opportunity. We have been here for a decade and having faced both opportunities and challenges, still have some advantages. For example, Huawei has a very close relationship with all local operators. In Mozambique, Huawei provides products and services alike for all communication operators—Vodacom, Movitel, TDM, and Mcel. The second aspect is that we have a majority of local staff at over 70%. Over the past decade, we have built on that relationship and trust with our local resources; hence, when an opportunity arises, we have a good chance of succeeding. Our core value is customer-centric innovation, which means we do not always give deliver state of the art technology to our customers; rather, we work to meet their specific needs and requirements with the best solution for the task at hand.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We have operations in the downstream segment in all African Lusophone countries and some others under the brand Galp. In Mozambique, we have had a presence for more than 50 years. The downstream operations in Mozambique are some of Petrogal’s most important operations beyond the Iberian Peninsula. Petrogal also has operations in Angola, Cape Verde, Guinea, Gambia, and Swaziland. Obviously, Swaziland and Gambia are not Portuguese-speaking countries, but we operate there nonetheless. African operations are very important for the future because we see high growth on the continent. In 2012, Petrogal’s business in Mozambique grew by around 12%, and in the future, the country will become one of our most significant markets. Indeed, as we move into natural gas, Mozambique is rapidly gaining importance. One of our advantages here is that we already have the contacts and know the right people, the rules, and the culture, as well as speaking the same language. Therefore, it is easier for us than for others unfamiliar with the country.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">“The economy is quite small, making the affordability of insurance the biggest challenge. Luckily, the cost of healthcare is pretty low in Tanzania, because the level of care is not yet uniformly sophisticated. This makes it still affordable and at a low level, relative to many other countries. As more specialists move into the country or return from abroad, the quality of care will increase and, with that, the cost base will increase over the next few years, as it did very rapidly in Kenya. Graduates who move abroad become specialists, and upon returning bring back technology and expertise. The premiums we charge are much lower than those observed in the developed world. I am sure that this market would not sustain the premiums that would have to be charged for a higher level of care."</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">“As an economy develops, the standard of living improves and there is a need to protect the wealth that is being created in the country. Without an effective insurance market, any progress achieved could be wasted, since a sustainable wealth creation model requires a strong insurance market. Individuals, too, require the security of insurance coverage, as do businesses. Where an economy is increasingly building up its middle class, this should in turn be reflected in the volume of insurance purchased. The low consumption of life insurance can negatively impact the nascent middle class in the years ahead. You would expect your children to enjoy the fruits of your efforts, and a lack of financial security puts this in jeopardy. Even people at the lower end of the pyramid can benefit from life insurance, as without financial protection they could end up worse off."</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">“With the growth of the country, more and more multinationals are coming to Tanzania. These companies require in-depth solutions for their businesses. That is where the broker plays a part, and AON Tanzania can easily add value there. The complexity of the risk involved must be assessed. Until 1990, ours was a closed economy, where industry was under-developed. AON brought in products that were much better suited to the needs of multinationals. When there is a lack of capacity in the market, AON can find this capacity overseas through its global network of insurance companies to ensure that the local industry remains supported. This is where we play our part by arranging adequate cover overseas."</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Max Malipo was an outcome of Maxcom Africa, which was founded in 2008. Operations began in 2010, with a core focus on bridging the gap between service providers and consumers. We saw that many service providers were only able to serve people through very few outlets across the country. There was so much demand that people had to wait in line to be attended to. We undertook to resolve this. Max Malipo is working to make retail services more like consumer goods, and more widely available in places where people might be buying other convenience items. We create payment gateways for a variety of services, which can be used by customers and retail agents alike.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The incubator was set up as a public-private partnership (PPP) by the World Bank, InfoDelf, the government of Tanzania, and the private sector. Initially, we started with Vodafone and are now with the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA). The basic idea behind this was to help ICT companies, or people with ICT ideas, to grow, formalize, and impact the economy in terms of bringing about development and realizing the country's vision 2025. In order to do so, we provide business development services across the chain from the idea stage through to company foundation. This includes providing our partners with networking opportunities, mentoring, coaching, proposal writing, and setup. And, if a client comes in with an idea as a pre-incubatee, we try to make it bankable, and then assist in the development of a prototype, whereupon the company is opened, registered, and taken to market in order to make a difference. Another role we play is in making sure that graduates who emerge from the incubator do not become job seekers, but job creators.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Digital Brain officially started in 2008, at a time when I was employed by the government in the Department of Medicine. In 2009, I resigned from my position, and since then have been working as a full-time entrepreneur running Digital Brain. We offer a number of products, but chiefly focus on four products and services. The first is software development. We develop software for the customer based on easy-to-maintain technology, and are using open-source technology to do it. The second product we offer is IT security. We make an assessment of the clients' systems that involves risk investigation, information system auditing, and system penetration testing. The third product we offer is consultancy in terms of product management and general advice regarding IT. The fourth is what we call “Boot Camp Training." This is a product that has taken us to the level that we have reached today. When we started the company, the initial revenue we generated came from this product. This service teaches IT technology and software through a short course with hands-on training and provides practical knowledge.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">My parents owned a computer store, and their challenge was marketing their products to the right audience. They didn't have the correct medium and most of their customers were students or lived in rural areas. Newspapers didn't cater to such customer groups and there was nothing available that was cheap or cost-effective enough for them to use regularly. At that point, about three years ago, mobiles were starting to take off and become more mainstream as a business. That is how the key concept came about, while I was still working in the US. The basic idea behind Bongo Live is an opt-in SMS advertising service. Customers can opt-in to receive offers based on their interests, and businesses can send offers to their target demographic. It helps businesses reach new customers, while also allowing them to communicate with their existing customer base. Our platform has tools to help users regularly stay in touch with customers. It is focused primarily on SMS, but currently we are looking at email and other marketing media as well. We have evolved our technology based on what our customers demand.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Over the past two years, the primary growth product has been mobile phones. From 2010 to 2011, there was three fold growth and from 2011 to 2012 business tripled again. That is one of the major contributors. Also, the audio-visual segment has grown on average in excess of 30%-40%. IT has been growing steadily, and during 2013 we have seen huge growth.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our rental rates have gone up significantly. Despite the high volume of retail space that has flooded the market, quality retail space has maintained its value. Our vision keeps the desires and requirements of our core customer base at the forefront of this shopping mall’s design and retail offering.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The medium-term strategy is to build our service centers and to build the white goods segment. OTE is already number two in the white goods sector in the country. We also intend to add to our manufacturing capabilities. We will go into Sohar Free Trade Zone and are looking at some of these redistribution centers here through which we can enter the Middle East as a market.</span></p>]]></sections21>

There’s much more money being spent in the country as a whole. There is significant growth in new housing with the related expenditure on air conditioning, home appliances, and electronics.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The bulk of our business definitely comes from neighboring markets like the UAE, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain. The European markets contribute a lot in the leisure and corporate segment. Due to the global presence of the Ramada and its major brand recognition, the hotel has a share of business from markets like India, China, and the Americas. Another segment that contributes heavily to the hotel is the local government and embassies, due to our location in the diplomatic area of Muscat. The hotel is also the preferred partner for outdoor catering when it comes to the ministries and embassies located here in Oman. The tourism business in Oman is mainly divided into seasons; the summer season is usually where the business is slow, with momentum picking up by mid-September. Additionally, many travel agents and tour operators prefer dealing with the hotel due to its simplistic approach to doing business.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our guests are primarily business focused and a broad mix of Western and GCC passport holders. In the leisure segment, they are primarily from German-speaking countries and the UK. We have also seen a growth in visitors from Spain and Italy. Our offering is truly diverse; we are located in the heart of the city, with close proximity to the Royal Opera House on the one hand, and Shati Al-Qurm on the other, with its wonderful beach. Add to that our 35 acres of parkland and the openness of the Omani people, and you have the makings of a splendid stay. We also take full advantage of our facilities by staging open-air concerts, events, and grand balls. The current allocation ratio is approximately 60-40 business and leisure. Peak leisure periods are from October until March. Business is year round, though obviously August is the slowest month for the whole city. Typically, the business is Sunday through Wednesday, so we are focusing on interregional weekend visitors, who arrive from Dubai or Abu Dhabi, just a four hour drive away. Meanwhile, we have continued to cater to leisure and core business from among German-speaking countries and the UK. And even during the dip in 2008, we still observed the same nationalities visiting.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Occupancy is on the rise. While the competition grew by 14% in 2012, we grew by 27% for the period, and with business doing well there is a lot to be thankful for. The year of 2012 saw a very harsh winter in Europe, which prompted many to board direct flights and escape the weather. We attend all the key trade shows in the UK, Germany, Finland,  France, Austria, Scandinavia, Barcelona, Italy, and Saudi Arabia, and we’ve left no market untapped. If you are a global brand, you have to be globally exposed. I have to say that the Ministry of Tourism has done an incredible job of improving Oman’s visibility. I have not seen any ministry in the Middle East that has worked as hard. I also feel that His Majesty’s approach is the correct one: to preserve the unique culture and heritage of Oman. As a result, things are picking up and going well. We see an increasing number of major events coming here today. The new airport will come online in 2015 or 2016. Overall, the growth and dynamism of our industry is a good sign for the country and its economy.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">During the high season, the occupancy rate is at around 90% and drops to 60% or 65% in the summer low season. The majority of our Gulf region clients come from Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai. Our hotels in Doha and Dubai host many Saudi Arabian clients, but Muscat is not a big destination for them. Our main guests are corporate clients, both European and from the GCC. Many GCC clients stay for short periods due to the proximity of their home countries. We have some clients from Dubai arriving in the morning and leaving again in the evening. The other important clients are the Europeans and Americans who come and stay for three or four days. Most of these clients are well-travelled, independent people. We do not have many package tourists, and tend to attract older, or more experimental travellers, keen to experience the culture. The leisure client has a tendency to stay here for two or three days, then travel elsewhere in the country for a spell, and then perhaps go on to Dubai for another few days.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Ministry of Tourism has done a great job of promoting Oman and we have always participated in its fairs, exhibitions, and events, be it in London for the World Travel Market, the ITB Berlin, or Dubai’s Arabian Travel Market, the key important travel trader exhibition. We also maintain a good business mix. In the winter, we see many leisure groups coming to Oman for cultural tourism. They demand a decent hotel to use as a base for visiting important sites, where they can enjoy excellent dining and rest in comfort. A number of people also come purely for a beach vacation, which we also offer. However, our largest business component is our corporate and government customers. Over the summer we have inbound business coming from the GCC countries, largely because of the school holidays. Families from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait come to vacation and discover Oman, or specifically Muscat, Salalah, and the interior. On the other hand, we see many more European families in the winter, as well as Asian guests—especially Malaysian and Indonesian groups—coming through on their way to other Middle Eastern destinations. At the Muscat hotel, 60%-65% of our business is from corporate clients, while 30-35% are leisure customers, either GCC families or European groups. Meanwhile, in Nizwa, 95% of customers are leisure tourists.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The sector has been making up for lost time. However, it is likely to return to normal growth, which is about 6%-10% per annum. In the first few years after the collapse, we saw negligible growth, so the greater increases in more recent years have made up for the lack of growth over that period. It is now a more sustainable market. I have, however, one large caveat; there is a tendency for markets to become too optimistic about growth based on what happens in nearby countries. Memories are very short and people should not base their investment decisions on what is happening across the border in Dubai.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The population of the country is increasing, and the country itself is growing. We are automatically affected when disposable incomes rise, as people start buying land, or if they have been waiting to build their own home, begin building. That translates into business for people like us. I see a silver lining and there are many developers who are ready to build apartments for sale. This all contributes to growth of the economy and of the real estate sector. It will not happen fast, but it will certainly happen.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Investor confidence has returned. The mood in 2H2012 and 2013 was much more optimistic than in previous years. Prices are a witness to this; they have been steady and even rising in certain areas of Muscat. Looking around the city of Muscat, one notices many new construction projects underway. We are a growing nation with very young demographic, so, in the long term, there is a requirement for housing, services, entertainment, offices, and malls, which are all directly related to the real estate sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As far as engineering is concerned, we have four branches: EPC projects, operation and maintenance, oil and gas, and civil work. At this stage, we are catering for our own business in civil engineering. In operations and maintenance, we are involved in maintaining power plants, hospitals, prestigious Royal properties, and several other small projects. We currently have around 20 ongoing engineering projects. We are also maintaining and operating water distribution network systems in the Musandam, Muscat, and Sharqiya regions. ONEIC is implementing a very prestigious scale project for MEDC. In oil and gas, high levels of competition have led us to team up with foreign companies. We are planning to be more active in this area in 2013 and 2014. We are engaged with a few EPC contracts for the construction of power stations, overhead lines, substations, and water distribution networks. We are registered for infrastructure and, in the future, shall be engaged in the construction of roads and dams. EPC contracts are challenging because there is heavy competition and the margins are thin. Any miscalculation could lead to negative figures. However, we need these kinds of reference projects for future activities.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In the last six years, the level of competition has increased four or five fold. In 2006 and 2007, for example, we tendered with seven companies; however, now it would be with more like 40-50 companies. This level of competition is challenging, but with our local strength we are able to maintain a good backlog of work. Globally, contractors are coming to Oman because it has very stable and progressive development. The downturns in the UAE, Spain, and Italy mean that contractors from those countries are now looking to Oman. Competition is extremely high, meaning jobs are taken at a very low profit margin. You need to be very efficient with excellent engineering, equipment, and maintenance, as well as competitive working hours. We work double shifts to keep costs down and productivity up. As a local company, we have thousands of Omanis working with us, which contributes to in-country value. In-country value is an increasingly more important requirement in Oman.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government is promoting two excellent and necessary initiatives: support for SMEs and Omanization. One of our central targets as a national company is to help make Oman an attractive environment for investment. The minimum wage has been raised to OMR325 per month, which we, as the private sector, feel is very good for the individuals benefitting, but also for society as a whole. The government is obliging companies to support SMEs by tendering out certain jobs and contracts. This is very necessary and beneficial, because even if one company could do all the work, it is unlikely to be done to such a high standard. We will grow together. We also support the government initiative of Omanization, because we believe that Omanis have the right to good jobs and good salaries, and we should make an environment that attracts high-quality candidates. Omanis shall be given good support, salaries, and respect. However, for this to work, young Omanis must be trained sufficiently to add value to the company. We are not subsidizing society or patronizing the youth. The most important thing is that all companies in Oman shoulder their responsibility to create a level playing field, and that the government, when awarding contracts, takes into account the efforts made by domestic companies to promote Omanization against those of international firms.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">In Oman, we are the only company specializing in providing affordable integrated housing solutions; most of the competitors’ projects, residential or mixed-use developments, are targeting the high-end market. In addition to focusing on affordability, we provide stylish designs with high-quality finishing; this is a crucial factor for homeowners. Today, we know for a fact that there is a shortfall in the supply of houses and plots. In order to keep up with our mission, we work hard to identify land that is in a good location, and we do our best to negotiate the price down, as this will indirectly benefit the customers better. Most of our projects are complete mini-city developments with different offerings; homeowners have the choice to buy a villa that best matches their financial capabilities, whether it is a little under OMR40,000 or over OMR200,000. As we are developing projects in different regions of Oman, we are committed to understanding the individuality of each region and the needs of the middle and middle to lower income segments; the mentality, attitude, choices, and preferences of Omani families vary from Muscat to Barka to Sohar; each region and each area has its own characteristics, requirements, and demands that we take into consideration.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The Omani government has concentrated on promoting tourism in Oman for the past few years, in line with His Majesty’s Vision for the Omani economy. As part of this drive, the government identified certain locations for development in integrated tourism complexes (ITCs). These ITCs contain tourism as well as business components, but the government is interested primarily in value-added in the tourism sector that these can provide. The land that Saraya Bandar Jissah is developing is an area of outstanding natural beauty, framed by the Hajjar mountains, which roll down to the water’s edge at the stunning natural beach. Our intention is to create a luxury development on the site, to complement its beauty. The total development area covers about 2.2 million sqm; however, the actual built up area will only use 400,000 sqm (roughly 20%) of the total area. The completed development will have two beachfront five-star hotels that will sit alongside residential areas. We will have around 400 residential units and the two hotels will have 312 rooms in total.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our success is a combination of trust, pricing strategy, and our unique vision. This unique product is based on design, quality, and size, which remains crucial in every property. We ensure that every fitting comes from a reputable brand, and all the building materials, while not the most expensive, will be of high quality. By keeping our margins lower, we are able to provide correspondingly higher quality properties. We try to do everything ourselves, avoiding outsourcing construction and development processes where possible. This is how you keep control of costs and maintain flexibility in your pricing. We currently employ 35 members of full-time staff in the office and 120 construction staff. It is only architectural design, interior design, and structural design that we outsource to professionals.</span></p>]]></sections21>

The idea of Nova short-stay surgical centers was born out of this discussion. Until recently, short-stay surgery has not been given much attention except in the UK, where all services are provided free, and where the potential cost benefits of short-stay hospital facilities are particularly attractive to the Exchequer.</span></p>]]></sections11>

In fact, our students are usually employed in their final year, before they graduate. The remainder continue on with their higher education or establish businesses. Higher education in Oman is re-orientating itself toward entrepreneurship. About five years ago we began offering specific entrepreneurial, management, HR, and soft-skill modules built into the engineering course; this is unique to CCE programs.</span></p>]]></sections01>

It is also a chance for us to obtain feedback on our graduates’ performance. We have involved industrial leaders in the design and review of programs. All skills that are needed for employment are embedded in the curriculum, rather than having separate programs to prepare students for job interviews.</span></p>]]></sections11>

The college is driven by the development objectives of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), and facilitates the corporate social responsibility of the commercial banks to place trained, professional Omanis in commanding positions in banking and finance.

We worked closely with the government, the Ministry of Manpower, the local population, and private sector companies to identify the needs of industry and train and recruit the right staff. Although the growth of higher education and colleges meant that companies were starting directly to employ college graduates, the need for competence development remained.</span></p>]]></sections41>

The country offered us the opportunity to expand into a market with relatively low penetration and to connect many of our international clients to it. Initially, we focused on corporate banking, which was starting to open up, but we also began our retail bank offering on a more limited scale. Our approach has been to examine the corporate value chain in its entirety and expand our banking services through tapping into existing customers' extensive networks, allowing a more seamless connection between all aspects of business. We have seen progress in opening up the markets over the past 20 years or so and I believe this is commendable, particularly given the country's history of nationalization. We are also encouraged by the constructive dialogue taking place between the banking sector and government, and are committed to working together to bring in reform aimed at boosting investment.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Stanbic is now among the leading banks in Tanzania. Our strategy is clear: to be dominant in corporate and investment banking, our leading business unit. We are also looking at key corporate business, and over five years have gained a broad market share. In the personal market, we have tended to look broadly at some HNW individuals and key strategic decision makers, either in corporate entities, governments, or embassies. Ultimately, we want to be the leading bank in the commercial banking sector—among those of $20 million annual turnover—so we are focusing on a very succinct target: the major corporations, IGOs, the commercial banking sector, and HNW individuals. The key challenge in Tanzania is inclusion. Tanzania has about 44 million people, and our estimate is that only 4 million are banked. Half of those 44 million are under 15 years old. If you don't include that half, you still have a comfortable 10-15 million people to bank.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We acted as the central bank in Liberia in the early 20th century, and opened our first African branch in Egypt in the 1950s. We now have 15 points of presence, including Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Zambia, as well as other large markets like South Africa and Nigeria. Tanzania rapidly became the location for one of the most important franchises in Africa. Few countries boast the kind of consistent economic growth that Tanzania has—an average of 7% annually. Citibank offers the full palette of services to corporate clients. Market-related products include foreign exchange transactions, swaps, and investment products. Where the client sees the difference is that Citibank has always leveraged its institutional banking arm and global platforms. The advantage of not being limited to local offerings is that we enjoy a much bigger budget for developing these products. Our success is a mix of our product offerings and our being able to put together a syndicate of banks and multilateral and bilateral agencies like export credit agencies, along with clients and sponsors.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Although Africa is our strategy, we prioritize the countries we enter based upon perceived opportunities, business outlook, strategic synergies with the Group's existing network, and the ease of doing business. Tanzania is a perfect choice thanks to its sustained political stability, 48 million plus population, low banking penetration, fertile agriculture, natural resources (gas, gold, etc.) and deep-water port, affording strategic access to eight land-locked countries in the EAC and southern parts of Africa. Today, the Tanzanian government is keen to expand credit access to SMEs. The central bank has licensed Credit Reference Bureaus to deter willful defaulters, while reducing the aversion of banks to lend. Meanwhile, Tanzania has about 52 banks, yet only 15% of the population is banked. Ecobank Tanzania is a champion of “Financial Inclusion", and consequently, mobile money is critical to our strategy as a more cost effective way of serving Tanzanians in remote locations without brick and mortar branches. This plays well to our strengths as we leverage our experience of doing this successfully in other African countries.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Tanzania, like many Asian countries, strives to fast track its economic development through its economic zones schemes. Countries like China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Korea, and others have been able to develop export-led economies, which enabled them to have solid industrial bases through economic zones. Tanzania is endowed with many natural resources; however, most of these are still exported in raw form. We believe that, through the development and promotion of special economic zones (SEZs), Tanzania will attract many new investors in the manufacturing sector, thereby promoting value-added, creating employment, generating revenue, and attracting foreign currency. In order to make SEZ development a reality, Export Processing Zones Authority (EPZA) has so far identified land parcels of around 2,000 hectares in 20 regions for SEZ development. The areas will be developed in phases depending on demand and availability of funds. With such a plan at hand, Tanzania's goal of becoming a semi-industrialized, middle-income country by 2025 will be achieved well in advance.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">What we do is provide interventions that guide company effort toward competitiveness. As far as the TCCIA is concerned, apart from facilitating dialogue for a better business environment, we are also teaming up with other institutions to create microenvironments conducive to competitiveness. We are working closely with the Commission for Science and Technology to establish what we call cluster initiatives. These are aimed at identifying enterprises that are in a specific geographic location and that provide an opportunity. Then, we get stakeholders in that environment to work together, which has not been happening. The government is concerned with security, regulations, and policies, but the private sector wants as little to do with the government as possible. On the other side, the academics have the knowledge assets, but their research agenda may not address the issues of the private sector. Therefore, what we are doing is creating a link by establishing a platform where people get together and share information. The private sector must realize that they are not individual entities, but occasionally require collaboration, which also includes the relevant institutions. The key is to have this advantage of collective competitiveness, because individually they will vanish. Today, the government is starting to recognize that if these enterprises perform, they will generate more tax revenue, greater employment, and more, which serves its main agenda.</span></p>]]></sections11>

The Board came into force on the October 1, 1997. The main functions as set out in the Tea Act No. 3 of 1997 are as follows: Advise the government on the policies and strategies for the development of the tea industry; regulate and control the quality of tea and tea by-products; collect, refine, maintain, use, or disseminate information or data relating to the tea industry; monitor the production and exportation of tea; regulate the processing, exportation, and storage of tea and tea by-products; represent the government in international and local forums in matters relating to the tea industry; regulate the import and export of tea; control pests and diseases; and promote and protect the interests of farmers against syndicates of buyers that may have been formed through associations.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Lebanon is a country that boasts a very diversified hospitality market, shifting constantly between business, leisure, spa tourism, MICE tourism, and so on. Right now it's not a steady market as we all know, considering the conflicts in the greater region. From my point of view it's actually a very strange and mixed market as people continue to spend large amounts of money on different types of hospitality products. Despite the economic situation, this country is alive and kicking. The hospitality sector is resisting the Arab Spring and the political instability that has crept close to our borders. In other words, this is a country where miracles can happen. Thanks to new online tools and a vigorous marketing team, we've opened new markets. This of course has to do with the fact that some destinations have large Lebanese communities, and our strong marketing efforts in this respect have paid off.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Crowne Plaza has been in the market for 11 years, a fact in which we take pride. The location of the hotel is also something that we put a lot of consideration into. It is situated on one of the busiest streets in Beirut, and is a historical street for the new Lebanon. There are two universities near our hotel, as well as large hospitals and centers of cultural heritage. When people visit and want an authentic experience, we tell them about Hamra Street. This is why our hotel is special in terms of its location. The facilities we provide are important as well. We have 190 rooms and suites in addition to nine meeting rooms. Any convention or meeting that takes place in the city can be accommodated here. It is the only five-star branded hotel on the street, and is part of an international chain. The rest of the nearby hotels are non-branded. We have 93 million InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) Rewards Club members, meaning these people have a place to stay in Beirut when they visit.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>One of the main strengths of the market is that we are in an area that, until recently, was very buoyant and active. Lebanon was the recreation center for all of the Arab countries that surround it until the latest developments began. It was ideal for Arabs as it is close and the language is, of course, the same. It offers things that Turkey cannot offer due to the language barrier. The same is true for Europe. This was really the playground of most of these economies. This has unfortunately changed in the past three years. It started with the travel ban, and customers started to explore new areas for recreation and began visiting Turkey, Morocco, and the Far East. We paid dearly for that. Our weakness is in our political instability. We have gone through a lot of ups and downs. This has affected us quite severely. The travel ban has been the most problematic and significant development.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In 2012, the Queen's Suites Hotel occupancy average was between 75% and 80%, which is good, taking into consideration the size of the hotel and the instability in the country. Because of the unstable situation in Lebanon, we couldn't target leisure tourism as much as business and especially medical tourism due to the fact that we are in the beating heart of Lebanon and nearby hospitals or clinics—we are very close to the American Hospital and other important medical centers. In Lebanon we don't have a lot of leisure tourism, because in order to have tourism, visitors need to feel safe and free; they need to feel that they can stay where they want and shop where they want without fear. If a tourist comes to Lebanon now, they will find no peace here or in the whole region, and it is very difficult for businesses and ambitious businessman like me. When I look to invest in a new building, I look for what it might be worth in a couple of years' time.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Oman has always been a good location. I think it is more competitive now, but the ability to manufacture is different from the ability to sell. Making a product is not that difficult; selling it is what is difficult. The market location of Salalah is a good one, and the location of Oman is a good one, but you have to be able to have internationally competitive cargo. The emerging competitiveness of the US through shale gas is going to have a massive impact on the industry; it is a game changer today. PVC made in the Southern US is now being exported to China. It comes down to cost; you need to be able to be cost competitive and have access. The FTA with the US gives you permanent relief without cargo limitations. While it does not give you any duty advantage, the FTA is an important element. It not only gives us access to the US market, but also it acts as an endorsement that we follow internationally recognized labor practices. It means that even a European company coming into Oman would have protection over its intellectual property rights. It creates a needed, very good, and healthy environment.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">BAE Systems has been in Oman for over 40 years; we have a very long association with the Sultanate’s defense forces, and we are proud that many of our products are in operational service. More than half of the defense equipment in Oman originates from BAE Systems or one of our predecessor companies. I believe that the strength of BAE Systems is that we are able to provide a comprehensive defense and security solution. We work in close partnership with the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and the Security Services, supporting them in protecting the Sultanate, while providing our expertise, products, and services. Over the years we have built a very privileged position with the country and have firmly established our roots here. Our work is about supporting the creation of skilled jobs in the Armed Forces and in industry; it is important that the right people are identified and trained, and that we share with them our vision so that they can ensure our ongoing stability and success. Our aim is for BAE Systems in Oman to be the partner of choice; ensuring we will maintain our position for the next generation.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The government is pushing hard on a number of fronts today and they are all interlinked. There is a lot of development in the public sector, from new and expanded airports and seaports, to increasing industry and attracting investors, competing regionally, and having an active defense program, which we are supporting. The location of Oman is critical to its success in terms of being able to offer the facility access from air, sea, and land. The rail project is critical also in terms of the economic boost it will bring to many areas and so stimulate further investment and growth. Our experience in Oman has been very good. Our reputation in the market has consistently been very good, and this year we picked up the Consultant of the Year Award from Construction Week, plus very recently the same award with Dossier Construction, which is a great credit to the team. We have been very focused over the past few years on demanding projects with the clients we have been targeting, and when you combine a very efficient lean team with the fact of the high quality of our offering, the result is successfully delivered projects and highly satisfied clients.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Let’s get to production first. There are a lot of opportunities for industry here in Oman. Until now, Oman is still very virgin. The good thing here is that the government provides support through soft loans, land grants, and modifying the rules and regulations, and this is further helped by the taxation framework. The government has created a very good atmosphere for investors to come here. LNG is getting big, exports are growing, the refineries are coming up, and Duqm is under development. Oman is constantly developing and progressing. We haven’t faced stagnation or decline in recent years. Everything is very strong and stable. I feel the oil and gas industry has a good future. It is huge, and this will be confirmed when we drill. The vision we have seen here in Oman is going to make us one of the leaders in the oil and gas industry locally. Circle Oil has a very good future ahead of it here in Oman, and we will keep on investing in the country. We are almost at the last stage of our current development plans.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">When we first came here, two years before the global financial crisis, the economy was booming, and it was lucrative to open a business in the GCC countries. We moved to Oman and were licensed by the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), opening in December 2006. We are the only Lebanese bank operating in Oman and our relationship with Lebanon is extremely close. Our banking activity is mainly concentrated on the corporate side, oriented toward trade finance and project finance. In the first three years, we financed a total of around OMR450 million worth of projects. We mainly service corporate clients, but we do offer retail banking for our corporate clients and our VIPs. We cater to their personal banking needs, housing finance, and credit cards. We now average about 15% of our business in retail and 85% in corporate. In 2012, we established a new department for SMEs and plan on focusing more and more attention on them. This requires more employees and human resources. For retail, we can compete in the market since the CBO has put forth new rules and conditions for retail banking. However, it is not our priority; we are not a local bank. You need a huge operational backbone to do retail banking.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">It is a very liquid market at the moment, with a substantial increase in the number of players in a short space of time. We have seen Bank Nizwa and alizz Islamic Bank open in the Islamic banking space, and so a larger number of banks are competing in what is undoubtedly a growing economy. There are big-ticket infrastructure projects being launched by the government, for example at Duqm Port, the railway, and investment in the airports. We are operating in an environment of significant investment, in a market that is already highly liquid, so there is margin compression. At the same time, there has been regulatory tightening on the personal assets side, where margins were reduced by 100 basis points, and we are continuing to feel the effects of this. However, HSBC Bank Middle East Limited, Oman is very well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities in the market. The Oman banking sector is very competitive and well capitalized. All the domestic banks remained profitable throughout the financial crisis as a result of the strong and prudent regulatory framework of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO). Statistics from the CBO indicate that the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) was maintained at a reasonably high level of over 12% through 2004 to 2010, with an average CAR of 14.3% at the end of 3Q2011.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Personal loans have grown very fast in the market to the extent that it began to create worry at the policy level that perhaps people had gotten too heavily indebted and were therefore beginning to face challenges in repaying their loans. The Central Bank of Oman (CBO) came up with guidelines. One is to cap the debt-burden ratio to 50%, so you cannot have reductions of more than 50% of your income. Also, there was a cap on the number of times you can top up your loan. Then, of course, the capping of interest rates to make sure that they are affordable to the clientele at 7%. Because of those initiatives, we have seen a slowdown in the rate of growth. It is still growing, but the pace has slowed down since 2012. The consumer base is also becoming more sophisticated. Islamic banks are a new phenomenon in the Omani banking scene. For now, I think their impact is moderate, but they are growing. Just like in other countries, the sector will have its own niche in the market. There have been studies with different speculations suggesting Islamic banking could take up to 20% of the market share. However, it is still too early to tell.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The capital markets are the barometers of economic activity in any growing economy. As far as the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) is concerned, it is more representative of the financial sector in Oman. Businesses here are owned either by the government or by large family groups that prefer holding them in private. The primary objective of capital markets in our opinion is to bridge the funding gap between businesses and capital providers. Currently, the economy has a high amount of financial liquidity. Banks are flooded with deposits and are looking for ways to lend the excess liquidity. Lower interest rates are also supportive for the lending growth of Omani banks. The underleveraged nature of companies in Oman provides them with more room for borrowing at cheaper costs rather than going down the equity-financing route. This prompts private family houses to retain their control and helps them to avoid the equity markets. However, providing enough tangible incentives for companies to list should attract a few promoters to take the equity route of financing. These incentives should not be just for the sake of listing, but should help in the overall development of the market as well. One way to do so is by giving listed companies a certain weight in transactions related to the government. But currently, we are not seeing any kind of incentives in this direction.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our objectives remain the same, except that we are more aggressively looking at investment opportunities. We often make our investments through certain structured vehicles. Our objective now is to grow in a much more aggressive manner. For that, we will be building special-purpose vehicles (SPVs) that invest in specific industries and businesses. Each of these SPVs makes a financial contribution of say 25% to each investment, while the remaining 75% may come from external investors, Omani or international. These SPVs would then be leveraged if appropriate to enable participation in larger and much bigger projects. The SPVs managed by this company would hold significant minority rights in each investee company with a board seat. In every company that we invest in, we contribute to the growth of the business. When A’Sharqiya invests in a company, it needs to know what the business will look like in five years. We invest in businesses where there is a good correlation between the investee company’s growth and sectoral growth. We also help the investee company strategize as to the best way to grow, either organically or inorganically. Oman is a relatively small country, and it would be difficult to build economies of scale by only catering to the local markets. Our investee companies, therefore, need to explore outward growth within the region.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our support is a mix of financial and management support. For Gulf Energy, we offered both financial and management support to open and run a business. We provided finance via shareholder loans, as lenders would not typically take start-up and contract risks. Our second part of the model is working with international partners and bringing them to Oman. We have a few success stories bringing in a Portuguese company (Silva Group) during the real estate boom to establish cement making and cement product-manufacturing companies. One was called Oman Portuguese Cement Products (OPCP) in Sohar, which became very successful. We also partnered with Sembcorp Industries from Singapore to build the largest power plant in the Dhofar region; it is a 450-MW facility supplying 13 million gallons of desalinated water per day. Through this, we became the leader in Oman, as the first Omani company to take a 40% stake in an independent water and power plant (IWPP). Also, with the Sembcorp project, we managed to achieve close to $750 million worth of deals during the financial crisis, and we also brought financing from Chinese banks into Oman, leveraging the government-to-government (G2G) relationship between Oman and China. Our other investment is Octal, the largest polyethylene terephthalate (PET) resin plant of its type in the Middle East, and the largest clear rigid PET sheet plant in the world.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Insurance is an integral part of economic development, but it all depends on the business model that is deployed and how it is built over a period of time. For local insurance companies, the profit drivers have been investment income and reinsurance commissions. Underwriting profitability has not been high on the priority list, and this restricts the growth of insurance talent; if you are insuring complicated risks and retaining them to your own account then you ensure that your employees understand these risks and you don’t lose your capital. Oman lacks well-trained insurance professionals and the sector has not been able to build its equity over time. Global corporations will put pressure on local companies with their size and expertise as markets open up to international players and insurance regulations.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Awareness is a must; people need to be made aware of the benefits of insurance, which will also make them feel more secure, particularly in the workplace. Workers coming from outside the country should know that they will be protected; however, employers must make the system work for their employees, be it in the government or private sector. We have prepared a marketing and advertising campaign to promote the types of cover we offer. People are aware of what is available, and individuals are able to take out their own insurance policies, but I think it is a must for organizations and employers to provide coverage to their employees.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Our core business lines are motor, medical, life, and cargo, but in reality we offer all types of insurance to our customers. In 2012, we grew by 40% and have been growing by an average of 22% a year for the past six years. Motor represents 35% and the rest is spread over medical, property, engineering, and life.  However, we have a strategy to select mainly profitable business lines and achieve robust financial results. Motor insurance is a good example as we have implemented a solid segmented tariff to attract good drivers and well price all the risks we are undertaking. Life and medical are also preferred lines, with the latter representing around 15% of our portfolio and becoming an increasingly important line of our total business. It is the fastest growing product.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I advocate mandatory basic medical insurance. You can opt for additional coverage by paying an additional premium. For example, you can add dental, maternity, optical, or critical illness. But there should be basic medical protection for each and every individual; when the customer goes to any hospital in Oman they should be aware of what is covered in that product and can deliver better customer service to the patients. If every company is offering different products, the healthcare providers will not be aware of what the insurance covers. In case different medical insurance products are issued, healthcare providers need to study each and every medical policy offered by various insurers in detail to provide prompt customer service to patients.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We believe the government continues to chart a judicious and well-considered strategy in building long-term, stable, and sustainable economic growth. Obviously, one of the pillars of that growth is an infrastructure budget that has doubled in the most recent five-year plan. As an insurance company, we see an opportunity to play a role in underwriting the progress of the country, which provides opportunities for growth and creates a trickledown effect as stronger employment and wages stimulate growth in the consumer sector. This will be in both the personal motor and our other lines including travel and household insurance, for example. If you look at Oman and indeed across the Middle East generally, penetration of insurance per capita is relatively low. This, combined with the infrastructure investment, growth in SMEs, employment generation, and economic stability, means that the fundamentals for long-term growth are very encouraging.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">My father started this company in 1960. It rapidly became one of the top companies because we have a diversified business model. We are involved in construction, automotive sales, the hospitality sector, and real estate. We are part of the economy as one of the companies that has developed Oman, having constructed 3,600 kilometers of Oman’s road network. We change with the times, and have the ability and the know-how to shift very quickly with the economy. Our success is dependent on running and managing a good business, but it is also fundamentally related to the success of the country. Our development shows how stable the country is, politically and economically. Our primary focus is on construction and manufacturing. We have a wood factory, which we pride ourselves on. We are one of very few operators in Oman and in the world that can produce at such a high quality. Our aluminum plant also occupies a significant share of the industry market. We don’t always have the expertise for specialist projects, but we do have the workforce and the ability to build. Business is booming in Oman, but the constantly shifting rules and regulations make doing business a little difficult.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Qurum Business Group (QBG) was founded in 1997, but before that we had other businesses operating under different names since the 1970s. In 1997, we registered the company, and in 2000 we started to group the businesses together under the name QBG. We are involved in various lines of business including construction, real estate development, facilities management, project support services, and financial services. The Omani market is rapidly growing and infrastructure requirements are increasing. The demand is there, and more construction companies are coming in. We have been approached by multi-million and multi-billion dollar companies aiming to enter the Omani market. Despite the economic downturn, Oman has experienced a steady growth rate, and government spending on infrastructure development is supporting this growth. Currently, we have an operational setup in three countries: Oman, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia. We are setting up an office in Mumbai, India, which will initially overlook the logistics activities of the group, and later begin planning for operational activities there. QBG is an Omani group with a clear vision to become international.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Al Anwar is just not about the current investments that it holds, but also the track record it has built up over the years. Al Anwar has evolved from an industrial investment company, and now it is an investment holding that follows the private equity model. Al Anwar has been an active and nimble company all along, and one of many investment holding companies, but with an important distinction—it has unique strategy and is one of the most successful investment holding companies in Oman. We strive to make and align our strategy along the contours of the changing market place. We have been associated with some of the more common names of publicly listed companies, such as Voltamp Energy, National Aluminum (better known as NAPCO), Computer Stationery, Majan Glass, and Al Anwar Ceramics, which was started by us more than 15 years ago. We want to make Al Anwar Holdings as one of the largest investment companies that is following the private equity model in Oman, and one of the most prominent in the region. Although we follow the private equity philosophy in our investment approach, we thankfully can hold on to a company as long as we like, and our entry/exit points are not constrained by any maturity dates.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Based in a land of great opportunities envisioned and shaped under the wise leadership of HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said, there has always been a continuous scope for our group to grow and prosper. However, our underlying investment interests have mainly originated from the needs of the country and the people of Oman. Our prime commitment is to contribute to the social and economic development of the Sultanate. In alignment with the country’s Vision 2020, we aim to develop out portfolio by strategically investing in areas of high potential and strengthening existing holdings. Efforts have been directed toward this through different activities, to name a few, such as the recent venture into logistics in the Sohar Free Zone. This is foreseen as a prime area that will support the undergoing development of Oman’s infrastructure and attract foreign investments. With Oman being promoted as a tourism hub, we are also working hand in hand with the government to expand our existing tourism activities in our travel consortium.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I used to work for Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) as a petroleum engineer, and I saw that there was an opportunity to leave and start oil field services. In 1986, when I left PDO, I saw the opportunity to provide services to PDO. Initially, we started representing international companies in Oman, and eventually we started our own services, mainly providing work-over services, then moving into production services and drilling. In 1999, we moved into acquiring marginal oil fields that did not fit the profile of the major oil companies. In our case, we bought two oil fields. At the same time, it also made sense to go into exploration for minerals. In Oman, we went into copper exploration, and we currently produce copper ore out of a mine near Sohar. From there, we started going international with oil field services. We are currently in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Australia, and New Zealand. We also expanded into engineering and now have an engineering company in Scotland, Germany, and Oman called United Engineering Services.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Islamic banking is very interesting, but it is very much in the initial stages. There is a belief that huge reserves will return to Oman from other countries, meaning the Islamic banks will become very strong. It is also suggested that large numbers of consumers will open new accounts. I do not believe either of those things is likely. Our independent studies predict that anything from 1% to 15% growth in the market could come from Islamic banking sources, achieved primarily through housing loans to the public and other lending. Some of the larger corporates have already indicated that they want to show commitment to their faith through sharia compliance.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There are many tools and instruments available in Islamic finance, ranging from the extreme pure trade to long-term equity. The fundamentals are that deals are based on sharia structures, although some looking at it from the outside feel that it looks similar to conventional finance, which is not altogether true. Nevertheless, a number of the same goals are achieved. Customers regularly ask about the difference between profit margin and interest rate. Essentially, the contract that guides the relationship makes the difference. The contract specifically contains the obligations of both parties. It also defines the rights of both parties very clearly. The crucial difference is that Islamic finance is based on assets, and we cannot advance cash.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Islamic banking will gain a share of 10% to 15%. The competition in Islamic banking will be based more on pricing than liquidity. I believe it is more about the relationship than the interest or profit earned when it comes to small depositors. Large depositors do not really care about whether it is an Islamic bank or not, and they tend to focus on the returns. I think there is growth, but I do not think it will impact heavily on traditional banking. If you look at other countries you can see growth in Islamic finance, but it is not a significant portion of the banking sector. Having said this, as one of the leading financial institutions in the country we want to be a leader in the Islamic finance sector.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Whenever there are high temperatures, the materials become more expensive and the costs go up. There was a project where we had to cool the oil temperature from when it came out of the well to a temperature that the facility could handle. That was a critical project. Our client was having an issue with well-case buckling. We came up with an expansion collar that can handle expansion in the event of high temperatures. The casing is the equipment that structures the whole well. We came up with an expansion collar that oil companies manufacture, and this is patented. It can handle expansion due to high temperatures. We started trying to see if we can expand this worldwide. We are talking to Oxy, PDO, and Shell.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We envision the continuation and growth of our EPC business and look to further build our reputation in delivering quality EPC project solutions. In early 2013, in line with its local initiative, PDO conducted, in cooperation with its nominated consultant, an evaluation and feedback on our current and developing EPC capability. It was a very constructive session, with the PDO/Consultant team being with us for four days during which it evaluated what we do and how we work. Al Hassan strives for collaboration and constructive feedback from its clients, because they are the people that we have to satisfy. Despite our current good reputation, we want to ensure that we continue to enhance and build on it so that we ensure that we are always heading in the right direction.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The focus is on engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) work, or any one of the three different areas. We see that there are a number of distinct advantages for our company because Oman’s EPC industry is relatively immature at this stage, with only a few local contractors and a number of international ones. There is a robust framework for operating in this country and that makes doing business here positive; if not necessarily the most lucrative in the region. Now that more large projects are coming, we have to push ourselves to be recognized for delivery assurance, capacity and capability. Our company must grow to compete for projects in the range of $200 million, many of which not suitable for tier-one contractors, as they simply don’t meet thresholds for their interest to bid. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) is actively encouraging Omani companies like ours to grow and bid in these areas with some excellent initiatives and we are trying to respond to that support positively.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Gas-fired steam production requires an initial capital expense in the form of steam generators, pipes, and water tanks, followed by 30 years or more of operating expense mostly in the form of natural gas purchase, so the total cost of ownership is the sum of the initial capital expense and ongoing operating expense. With solar, there is a much larger capital expense up front to build the system, and then zero fuel use for 30 years, so it is difficult to directly compare the two approaches. The technique that most companies use is called gas breakeven (GBE), which compares the total cost of ownership over a fixed time period. In typical, large-scale deployments, the GBE for solar is $5 per MMBtu, which compares favorably with current prices for LNG, which can be as high as $18 per MMBtu.</span></p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">We are one of the pioneers in the area of renewable energy in Oman. Renewable energy is very costly to construct, but is also very desirable. The company’s first initiative from the government was to produce renewable energy via six projects. We will soon commence the first pilot project in al-Mazyunah, in the Dhofar Governorate. This will start with about 3 MW in installed capacity. The first pilot will be about 380 kW of capacity to test the technology of the solar system here in the country. We launched this after the government gave us the green light to go ahead with renewable energy. We launched six projects and then public interest called for investment in more than 30 new projects. This gave us a very strong indication that the tendency toward investment in renewable energy in Oman is very strong.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">As Oman is a fast developing country, there is huge growth, so there’s going to be a need for the government to focus more on energy efficiency and conservation. The public authorities have already started some demand-side efficiency initiatives because it’s not sustainable to always be chasing demand; you have to try to manage it. Our key challenge will be fuel diversity. We have to look at renewables and sources other than gas. Almost all of our plants operate on gas. We also have challenges regarding desalination when it comes to water. There are technical challenges when it comes to the water security aspect of it as well. We will focus more on utilizing beach wells rather than open intakes to balance that. We will mostly be concentrating on assisting and advising the government to secure the buy-in for renewable energy, and looking at the key issue of fuel-mix policy in general. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, and water conservation are going to be the key debates because almost 90% of our water is from desalination, which is very expensive.</span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Electricity Holding Company was established as a result of the laws that restructured the electricity industry in Oman, which basically created three functions: the operation function, the regulatory function of the industry, and then the Public Authority for Electricity and Water, which is the policy maker in the electricity industry. The sector is divided between the companies that actually do the operations, companies that distribute and supply, companies that transmit electricity, and companies that generate electricity. The model for generation in Oman is that there is a single buyer for electricity and water from the market and from private entities, which in turn sell it to the distribution companies, which then sell it to consumers.</span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Mazoon is one of the government-owned companies that came into existence as a result of the restructuring of the electricity sector and its related water services. It has a license to distribute and supply electricity in four governorates, namely al-Dakhiliyah, ash-Sharqiyah North, ash-Sharqiyah South, and South Batinah. We have approximately 300,000 customers, and there is high growth in terms of new customers alongside high growth in demand for electricity. Mazoon is keen to adopt new technology and invest in infrastructure to meet the growing demand for electricity in the country, whether it is industrial, commercial, or domestic.</span></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Electricity demand has been increasing year on year. OPWP undertakes long-term generation planning and publishes a seven-year statement. This statement includes the identification of new IPP/IWPP projects to be competitively tendered and developed by private sector entities, in order to meet the future power generation and water desalination requirements of the Sultanate of Oman. OPWP have managed to increase the generation capacity massively in the last six to seven years, which has contributed to servicing this increased demand. Servicing the demand side from the other angle is another challenge that the Muscat Electricity Distribution Company (MEDC) is currently working on. The electricity sector is currently in the process of drafting an energy policy for the whole sector, which hopes to answer many of the questions that we currently have. We have several initiatives that have been performing during the summer time when the peak load is picking up to manage demand.</span></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Although the mobile market is too competitive and over penetrated, I still see a growth potential there. I don’t think the real growth will be down to growth in the number of subscribers but in average revenue per user (ARPU). Mobile broadband usage is heavily increasing, which substitutes and outweighs the decrease in international voice and SMS revenues. Fixed-line broadband will definitely be the market where we will see the highest growth in the coming years. We also have high expectations from the corporate market. Oman is a large country compared to other countries in the region, with a low population density. It is also a difficult terrain with desert and mountainous areas; in addition the non-urban population is lightly clustered. These are the factors that collectively mean very high infrastructure investments with no or very long-term returns to the incumbent telecom operators. In this respect I find the government’s intervention in the telecom market just and right. The regulatory body, the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), supports the government’s efforts in universal access by associated investment mandates requested from operators every time a strategic license is issued. There is a well-managed licensing framework and support from the government to private companies to add on to the country’s infrastructure, that is the practice that the world follows.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There is huge investment coming from petrochemical companies, which are rightly expecting to have sophisticated telecommunications systems to back them up. All of this activity is driving tremendous investment. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), in telecoms network readiness Oman is ranked 40th in the 200 countries of the world. As both operators have implemented 4G, we have a very sophisticated end-to-end service from the companies in operation today. The WEF measurement for mobile penetration ranks us seventh in the world. The fact is we are investing more than we have ever invested before to deliver the incredible service we have today. We are in the top 10% of networks in the world, having rolled out 4G in Oman. If we can attract people to begin using 4G as soon as possible, it will allow us to offer the service at an effective price. The government is involved in many different areas. The most important change it has made recently is to make extra frequencies available, which has allowed us to do a number of new things. The government has done a fantastic job and much of the activity has been led by the TRA. Using this new frequency means that we can do so much more to delight our customers.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">The international service is very important. We are always looking into new opportunities. If there is something that fits, we do not take licenses just to have them, but if there are licenses that fit with our strategic scope then of course we are interested. However, the biggest trend we have seen during the four years that we have been operating here is that data and the internet are becoming even more important. We launched our internet offering in February 2011, and we were the first to launch a monthly package on pre-paid. Until we launched this service, the only way you could access data on your pre-paid phone was signing up for 24-hour offers. Other providers have launched similar offers since then, and I think that everyone is seeing huge growth in the use of data and internet via mobile phones these days. The increase has been helped by the explosive use of smartphones. In Oman, this huge growth has been concentrated in the last two or three years. Despite the rise of voice over IP (VoIP) services, we have not seen any drop in conventional calling, so we have not seen any huge changes in market patterns. Data is used not only for calling; it is used for many things, and nowadays different segments use different data products.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">There is an increasing demand for our products in the domestic market as well as the GCC markets. Initially, our scope was to improve our service in this market. We wish to make use of the free trade agreement (FTA) between the US and Oman to enter into the US market and are looking into either establishing an office in the US or finding a distribution partner. The only drawback to this will be the competition we face from the Far Eastern and Indian products. As Oman is a petroleum driven economy, we have established ourselves as a leading supplier to all the petroleum companies with our products. The government’s plans to explore for more oil will be an added advantage to us since demand will increase for our products. More petroleum downstream industries are being formed and this too will help us as we can cater to their packaging requirement.</span></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">Oman is a primary market for our products, and we are the number one in the Oman market. Of late, competition in the local market increased due to excess capacity from global suppliers and a weak recovery in the global economy; however, these factors could not deter Oman Cables from securing a higher and more dominant market position in Oman. In regard to exports, OCI started focusing on export markets as early as 1988 with a view to broaden its horizons beyond the domestic market. The first export of coils is still fresh in my mind and was supplied to a customer in Bahrain. Today, OCI supplies its products to all the GCC markets, the Middle East, Far East Asia, Africa, and Europe. OCI expanded its customer base by supplying its products to various industry segments from traditional utility and infrastructure markets.</span></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'PT Serif', serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">I find the regulatory atmosphere very challenging, but also very positive because we supply to consumers. We should respect the highest standards when it comes to quality, health and safety, and environmental considerations. We have excellent coordination with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the water authorities, and, also, the municipality, which monitors us in several areas. I think this is to the benefit of consumers and, at the end of the day, to our company. We already carry out some exports, particularly to African countries, but that is less than 2%—4% of our total sales. We mostly focus on the Omani market, but we also look to the neighboring countries if there are some opportunities, particularly on the juice side.</span></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>For us as a company, the real estate aspect of business is very strong. We have been very successful, and we have sold around 90% of all our projects. As a country, other Lebanese developers have also been very successful. However, some have said that there has been a slowdown because of political unrest. We are doing very well, and we are looking to develop more projects when we find the right locations. As far as we are concerned, we are very confident about the future. We are going after it very aggressively and grabbing every opportunity where we can build a sellable and viable home for people. We have many offers for projects, but we like to pick and choose prime locations where we can build a quality product at a quality price. As for the future, we have tremendous confidence in Lebanon. Even with all the obstacles, the market has always overcome adversity. We are very confident, and that is why we have over 15 projects and we are looking for more. We are not going to stop now. Our designs are completely different from what is on the market—they are not just brick and stone.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Despite investors' wait-and-see attitude toward persisting regional uncertainties, the Lebanese real estate market stood its ground in 2012 due to strong fundamentals pertaining to demographics, land scarcity, a sophisticated banking sector, and support from the Banque du Liban. To put that in perspective, despite a year-on-year 9%-10% decrease in both 2012 construction permits and sales transactions, land prices have stabilized, but property prices have declined by 10%-20%, thus attracting hesitant expatriate buyers and reducing the gap created by the absence of GCC investors. Moreover, FDI from Lebanese expatriates has risen slightly, while the low-medium residential category was still performing in suburban areas. Besides the strength of its market fundamentals, the sustainability of Lebanese real estate is also attributed to high-quality products and services offered by the medical, educational, entertainment, tourism, and retail sectors. All mentioned factors have contributed to the flat state of Lebanon's famous “stair-case model,“ which means the real estate sector is expected to eventually pick-up after a period of stability. In other words, it is currently a “bear“ market; unless you have to buy, you are waiting.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The sector is not performing well these days because of what is happening around Lebanon in the Middle East. We started to feel this slowdown two years ago, when Syria's problems started. This is affecting our sales a lot. For the last five or six months, Lebanon was affected directly by Syria's affairs and there were heated debates on TV that really hit our business. For the last six months, it has been really very slow. There is no fear, though. The real estate sector is very slow moving now, but it is on solid ground. Lebanon is small and the main real estate is in the capital and its suburbs. There is a lot of natural demand. End-users want to use these apartments, and they don't want to buy apartments for making money. There are many Lebanese expatriates and they have children that want to come back to buy housing. There is no fear for the real estate market, and the proof behind this is that after two years of slowing down, prices are almost the same. Sometimes there are people who give a discount to sell quicker, but, generally, the market price is stable; there has been no crash in the market. The land is very expensive. If in another country, there were a few years of stagnation, the price would fall down directly, but here there has been only maybe a 10%-15% decrease. Generally, the price is the same. Another point about apartments is that the price now does not reflect the real cost; the real cost is higher than the actual cost now.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are among the alpha companies—number six or seven—which is why we need to be very competitive. There are over 50 insurance companies in Lebanon, which is a lot in a country like this. This requires some lobbying at the Ministry of Economy to create an incentive for a merger approach that will help companies increase their capitalization and reduce the number of players in this small market. Currently, we have companies that are small and need to merge with bigger ones. They have built a good amount of trust among the Lebanese public; people insure their cars because it is obligatory and they buy health insurance coverage because they are scared of the fat hospital bill that they could end up with. Life insurance is improving little by little; things will be more aggressive in the coming two to three years. Our general insurance business has also improved, as have our medical premiums. We are expecting at least 15% growth in all lines during 2013.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I think that, in the Middle East, Lebanon is one of the best environments. The problem we face today is economic due to negative events in the region, and not just in Syria. Today in particular, there is a crisis in tourism; some hotels even closed in June, and very few people are travelling to Lebanon. Those arriving ultimately return to their countries, and this naturally impacts the insurance sector. When you have money in a country, much more works. The restaurants are full, the hotels are occupied, and in turn the economy flourishes. Today's climate in Lebanon is somewhat of a vicious circle and is a key problem that we face. There are over 50 insurance companies in Lebanon, which makes it a saturated market in need of consolidation. A merger law was passed in 1999 as a result of which three companies combined to form Capital Insurance. Today, I am a shareholder. I had formerly owned the company pre-merger with BBAC bank, and today it is a much improved commercial entity. In my view, further legislation should be introduced to promulgate consolidation of the sector leaving just half of the current number of companies competing in it.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are part of the Mediterranean region for AXA, and the company is present in Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Turkey, Algeria, Morocco, Lebanon, and the Gulf. The Lebanese AXA entity is probably the smallest in the region, but I see it as an entry point to the area. The biggest challenge we face is to implement new legislation. The current laws are outdated and should be amended. Ideally, this could be done through a dialogue between the regulator and the boards of the companies so as  to modernize the system. The government worked on a draft in 2007, but it did not make it to parliament. The sector is now considering a new draft law. However, the minimum capital requirement is too low. In the insurance business, we follow the solvency margin, which is an important key performance indicator (KPI). There are over 50 companies operating in the sector, three or four of which are reinsurance companies. There are approximately five to eight companies that only deal with life insurance, and the top 10 companies control around 75% of the market. The market is too concentrated, and there seems to be a lack of mergers and ways of dealing with the saturation.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Before 1974, Lebanon had the only dealer for Ferrari in the Middle East. After 1974, there was no more Ferrari in Lebanon, so the company started to operate in other parts of the region. Ferrari came back to Beirut in 1995 or 1996 through the Fiat dealer. In 2003, they tried to merge Maserati and Ferrari and approached Bazerji, the dealer of Maserati. In 2006, they took the decision to split, and Sports Motor Group took over the dealership. At that moment, the allocation of cars was between nine and 12 cars for the whole year. In October 2009, I joined the company, and in 2010 we delivered 47 cars. At that time, this was the number two performance in the Middle East. It was 100 for the UAE and 47 for Beirut, with another 42 for Kuwait. Lebanon is a very strong market for Ferrari in the Middle East. If you compare it to the Gulf, we have higher customs rates. In the Gulf, it it's only 5%, but in Lebanon we have customs and VAT, which rises approximately to 60% plus 6% for registration, so the car in Lebanon is almost double the price compared to some countries.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The last few years have been difficult. We reached a peak between 2008 and 2010, which were very good years; however, for the past two years we have been suffering. The luxury car sector in Lebanon has been declining; even though car sales have risen slightly, this is mainly in the small and cheap car market. For our company, the recent period has been satisfactory, but it was not like the good years we experienced previously. One milestone is probably the continued success of the Fiat 500, and this has been one of my greatest achievements since I started working in this company. We have very high customer satisfaction with this model. Fiat had  faced difficulties if you look back 10 years, but now that has been completely reversed. Lebanon has one of the highest market shares in the luxury segment for Jaguar in the world. We are one of the oldest partners of the company. My father started the partnership 60 years ago, and he was considered one of the ambassadors for the brand. Jaguar has always given great recognition to our company. Jaguar is a small manufacturer and today sells approximately 55,000 cars. If you compare that to our German competitors that sell over a million cars, it is a very small niche maker. Despite that, we are still able to record very decent sales figures in Lebanon.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the late 1960s, our family was the pioneer in the business of sports cars in the Levant and the Middle East, and the first and only Maserati dealer. At that time, sales were counted in units and I still remember the name of the customers. While Lebanon was modernized and developed, the Gulf countries were emerging. Regrettably, the business of luxury sports cars was interrupted during the Civil War of 1975 to 1990. Over the past decade, we were able to secure for Maserati regular yearly growth that brought sales from seven units in 1994 to 27 units per year since 2010, with a target to exceed 180 units in 2016. The majority of Maserati customers are successful Lebanese businessmen, doctors, bankers, and lawyers, with an interesting growing number of female customers. The buyer of a Maserati, BMW, or Jaguar is an enthusiast of cars with a heritage of luxury, comfort, and power as a tribute to his social or professional position; a kind of personal affirmation, as these are luxury sports cars that can be used and enjoyed every day.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FUTURE PROJECTS</h4><p>Our latest project, which we will be launching soon, is Deck 32. It is a luxury residential tower offering small-sized apartments. All apartments get a sea view starting from the 10th floor.</p><h4>GOING GREEN</h4><p>Green buildings are a priority for A&amp;H. Most of our developments are specified and designed to very high standards that meet LEED certifications; however, we haven't yet gone through the process of getting them officially certified.</p><h4>TRENDS</h4><p>There are some developers that have started shifting to smaller sized units recently to lower the unit cost. On the other hand, real estate outside Beirut has seen better performance as it is offering small-sized apartments.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PROSPECTS</h4><p>We are focusing more on the commercial part of the business. Our prospects are in property management development and project consultancy.</p><h4>DIFFERENCES</h4><p>If we compare 1H2013 to 1H2012, there is definitely a lag in the number of real estate transactions in the residential sector.</p><h4>PIPELINES</h4><p>We have two projects in the pipeline. One is a commercial center, which I really believe in. The other is furnished apartments catering to the elite LAU students.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>VARIATION</h4><p>We came up with the idea of creating a village. We wanted everything nice in a community, but we didn't want repetitious architecture. We assembled 11 architects and gave each a part of the project.</p><h4>CITY PLACES</h4><p>The Metn region is the best area in Lebanon, because it is undervalued and it is geographically beautiful. The Bkheir project is fantastic, and is currently under construction. The first 16 buildings are in the completion phase.</p><h4>AWARDS</h4><p>Aura just won the “best architecture“ award from the International Property Awards. It is one of the smallest projects in Erbil, but take it and put it in Lebanon, and you will feel that it is huge.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OUTLINES<br></h4><p>Prime Consult develops projects and sells them to investors. We conduct research, put together a business plan, and seek out investors for the project.</p><h4>FDI</h4><p>Overall, 2013 has not been as good as past ones, given so many circumstances with the war in Syria. Investments go hand-in-hand with faith, and if there are doubts, then there are few investments.</p><h4>GOALS</h4><p>My expectation is that we are all following the same trend; we are all moving toward smaller apartments, especially outside Beirut.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>CHALLENGES</h4><p>Lebanon is not an easy country to work in. Along with the unstable political environment, we face tough competition. Lebanon has everything; it is a small country but with low purchasing power compared to the other GCC countries.</p><h4>POTENTIAL</h4><p>As we all know, Lebanon is today facing a severe socio-economic and political crisis. Despite the situation, we are seeking  good opportunities for sites in different regions of the country.</p><h4>SUCCESSES</h4><p>LeMall Dbayeh was launched in August 2012, and its success surpassed our expectations. Today, we welcome around 4 million visitors per year.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are now producing semi-finished products. We are selling to chocolate factories and dealers. Our next step is to produce industrial chocolate in large volumes. We also want to have the capability to bring people to the world's small chocolate dealers that are making the finished products. We are renting a huge installation of 2,200 sqm, and we will distribute semi-finished products and chocolate, as well as industrial chocolate, to Europe and CIS countries. We are planning to invest around $2 million or $3 million, and our plan is to establish a chain; we will produce the products in Ecuador and make the finished orders there. Then, we will fine-tune the chocolate that we are selling to the end customer. Right now, Europe accounts for 25%-30% of our market. We are also very strong in Latin America, which accounts for about 40% of our sales. We live in Latin America, we are proud to be Latin American, and we are working to be increasingly involved in the region. We sell considerably to Chile, Colombia, Bolivia, and even Peru, which is a producer of cocoa. I also hope that Venezuela will become a little calmer so that we can return to that market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Currently, Azucarera Valdez represents 30% of the country's overall sugar production, whereas the remaining 70% is controlled by five different sugar holdings, two of which are as large as we are. Therefore, we can say that 90% of the sugar production in Ecuador is controlled by three big holdings. We have a production plant with a grinding capacity of 11,000 tons of sugar per day. Azucarera Valdez is the most reputable and innovative brand in the industry; we are a company with a presence across Ecuador, and our strength is based on individual consumers and their preference for our sugar. Innovation, for us, means diversification of products; currently, we have brown and white sugar, light brown and light white sugar, and we are conducting market research to launch other types of sugar, like flavored sugar and sugar fortified with vitamins. We have also been launching new packaging modules in order to reach different consumer ends in the market. However, we have to keep in mind that this is an industry based on production costs, and the main aim of producers is efficiency and productivity. Azucarera Valdez has always been a pioneer when innovating in these fields. In terms of employees, some 3,000 people work here during the peak time of the year.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the US, we are opening our own office, Hoja Verde US, as many clients there consider importing from Ecuador to be too difficult. Hoja Verde US will import from us. We now also have an agreement with Amazon, which will help us hugely with distribution. We have a Benelux distributor; however, it is difficult to get a foothold in the European markets as there is already so much chocolate there. With coffee, we are attempting to make specialized products depending exactly on what the end user wants. We want to find the right grower for the right client and to eventually have tailored coffee from a specific farmer being sold in each individual coffee shop or restaurant that buys from us. We cannot produce particular coffee blends in bulk here in Ecuador. This is why we have to keep it specialized. To enter the chocolate and coffee markets, we have to jump straight into the high-end markets and offer the best quality. There is no scope for intermediate-quality products, and we cannot afford to take the smaller steps as we are so far away. Therefore, we must invest in technology, recipes, and advice to bring ourselves to the highest level. As an example of this, we are spending $15,000 to bring a German expert here for one week, which shows how serious we are about developing our products.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>R&amp;D activities require large amounts of investment, and in the particular case of Pfizer, the company has several international centers that constantly work on developing more innovative and advanced products for the market. In Ecuador, we distribute such products, and we conduct extensive market research to establish the best products that can successfully impact patients' lives and, therefore, become a commercial opportunity in the country. In this particular market, products such as antibiotics, cardiovascular medicines, and pain relievers are the most important. We focus on providing high-quality products for these segments in general. Therefore, we do not plan to establish research centers in Ecuador. The Ecuadorean market and the government of the country are strongly pushing toward having more high-quality products on the market. Pfizer's strategy and mission perfectly fits with this aim for the industry, and it coincides with what is happening in the surrounding region as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>It was a dream come true when we first came to Ecuador in 2008. Siegfried represented a particular bet for the company, as we had tried to enter this market long ago with little success. The success of the first years encouraged us to keep up the high level of investment, and we are pleased with the results. Today, Ecuador enjoys stable and clear policies, and the pharmaceutical market is very competitive. At the same time, Laboratorios Siegfried has been operating in the industry for over 90 years, and we are experts in the field. In terms of regional percentages, Ecuador represents around 8% of the company's activities, and we believe we can grow this figure a little more. We have to keep in mind that we cannot compare a market such as the Ecuadorean one, where the overall production of the industry reached $1.1 billion, to other larger markets like Argentina, Brazil, or Mexico.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In pharmaceutical manufacturing, if you are not continually investing you will fall behind. The regulatory side is becoming more stringent all over the world; therefore, you have to be aware of that and know which trends will be reflected in regulations. You have to be in front of that to be competitive. It means that you need to invest in technology, facilities, and equipment, as well as in people. Pharmaceutical manufacturing is very specialized, each and every unit has to comply with the highest standards, there is no room for mistakes, and you must have complete control of your processes. In 2013, we are going to make a large investment in a new line of large-volume parenterals and a complete line of lyophilized products. Those two are the most important facilities investments for 2013; the new lines will be started up at the beginning of 2014. In addition to that, we are investing in ERP-CRM administrative software. In total, we will be investing around $9 million.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Ecuadorean market has had for a long time a control over prices, which limits selling prices. The 2008 Constitution brought a very important change to the pharmaceutical sector, because health is now considered as a strategic sector, meaning that government investment increases every year; for example, health coverage among society has expanded, which means that more people have access to services and medicines than ever before. This also means that the market for the private sector has become smaller, which has led to companies trying to diversify their activities and portfolios, or else trying to become more efficient to grab opportunities within the government's scope of responsibilities. Additionally, we have to say that in the Ecuadorean pharmaceutical industry the percentage of exports is very small, meaning that imports are high, especially when it comes to multinational companies operating here. Domestic pharmaceutical production only reaches 15% to 20% of the current overall market production. For example, we import from the UAE, Brazil, and Mexico.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>It took us around five years to be accepted into the main international academic circles. Yet, today we are among an elite class of higher education institutions in terms of quality, infrastructure, and surroundings. We are now a member of the International Sustainable Campus Network (ISCN), of which other member institutions include Oxford, Cambridge, the London School of Economics, Polytechnic of Milan, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, MIT, and the University of Cape Town. UIDE has a campus in Quito, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and we also have an extension on the Galápagos Islands. With 1,000 parking spaces near the entrance, our campus is free of congestion. As an institution we are highly committed to environmental sustainability. Our auditorium boasting unique architecture was built with recycled materials. We also have several ongoing initiatives to preserve the environment such as a fertilizer plant to generate electricity, and electric and solar cars.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The University was born as a technical institute to provide more freedom in terms of programs, courses, and activities. However, the institution evolved over the years into a technical university due, among other things, to student pressure. Our main goal has long been to be a leading technical institution in the higher education sector. Therefore, Universidad Tecnológica Equinoccial (UTE) was born in 1986 once the national authorities give us the green light; previously, it had been operating as a technical institute. Despite facing tough economic conditions over the years, we secured stable support and resources, especially through an Italian institution, allowing us to become a leading national institution. Over the years, we have expanded our activities and infrastructure, and one of the key moments was arrival in Santo Domingo, which presented many opportunities in the agribusiness, educational, and professional segments, contributing also to the development of the city and region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>When the doors first opened 55 years ago, the institution was a polytechnic institute that depended on the Ministry of Education, subsequently becoming a university. We started with an initial investment of $30 million in total—80% derived from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and 30% from the government—to build, equip, and train professors to launch Master's programs. In 1991, ESPOL as it is known today was inaugurated. We started with an Earth science program and launched the electrical engineering program one year later; neither program existed elsewhere in Ecuador. The professionals in these areas were people working in Guayaquil who had graduated from the US or Europe. They were working as part-time professors in this program and boasted a diversity of backgrounds and experience gained from universities abroad.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our institution was established in 1993 and we started with a high-profile business management course for CEOs, which attracted the leaders of the main companies in Ecuador. Over the years, we have specialized in training professionals and people, as our education offers value, too. Since 2006, we rank among as the top-20 Latin American business schools, and the top business school in Ecuador; we prepare the future business leaders of Ecuador and the entire region. We put huge emphasis on social responsibility, ethics, and making Ecuador and its leaders a more attractive investment proposition for foreign investors. Over the years, we have expanded our course portfolio and extracurricular activities in order to broaden the scope of activity of the institution. Today, IDE Business School's brand and its academic staff are highly recognized in the entire region. Therefore, we have positively contributed to the development of Ecuador and its business sector for two decades now.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BEGINNINGS</h4><p>We came to Ecuador in 2002 and secured our first contract with PacificTel in 2006. In the beginning, we were very competitive, with good construction and engineering services, and the company delivered quality products that fostered communication.</p><h4>INTRODUCING…</h4><p>Aside from the mobile product, we are introducing PTN products, which include a package transmission network based on IP technology. The PTN is a new concept that we presented to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the organization responsible for issues in telecommunications worldwide.</p><h4>MAIN CLIENTS</h4><p>Previously, we focused on CNT, Claro, and Movistar. Recently, we have kept an eye on enterprise yields, which means government institutions and large companies, such as the military or banks.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>REASONS WHY</h4><p>We started out in 1995, and at that time we were the biggest computer equipment reseller, and we observed that a very high number of our customers had inadequate internet connections; therefore, we decided to enter into that business.</p><h4>HOT SPOTS</h4><p>We are planning to offer 10,000 access points outdoors, meaning that you would have access to hotspots over most of the main cities that could be used. We are starting to deploy these over 2013, and are hoping to have 70% to 80% of the cities covered by the end of 2014.</p><h4>MATURATION PERIOD</h4><p>In the telecommunications sector overall, we are small players because the mobile phone operators are huge. However, our market is growing, as is the whole sector, faster than GDP, and I think we are approaching a period where it will start to mature.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>VITAL PROCESS</h4><p>Huawei arrived in Ecuador at a crucial technological moment, when the country underwent the process of shifting from TDM to VoIP technology. In this context, we installed a high technology plant in Ecuador, contributing to the vital process.</p><h4>4G UPGRADE</h4><p>The introduction of 4G will be a very important step in the industry. Usually, when introducing new technologies, we also introduce new equipment and systems; however, in this case we won't need to do so, because we will keep the 3G equipment, and upgrade it to 4G.</p><h4>WORLDWIDE</h4><p>In 2011, we were the second IT company worldwide, and one year later we were already leading the ICT market. In terms of Ecuador, we expect to close this year with an above 10% sales increase compared to last year.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>A LONG TIME</h4><p>Alcatel-Lucent Ecuador has developed a business relationship of more than 50 years with local operators of telecommunications, services, universities, and strategic industries.</p><h4>GOOD LABEL</h4><p>The government has labeled the IT industry a key sector for the development of the country and its people, and that is driving competitiveness in the market. In this regard, Alcatel-Lucent has played a key role in the IT industry up until today, and we have developed extensive research to provide the competitive market with the right solutions and services.</p><h4>FIRST IN LINE</h4><p>We were the first company to apply the latest generation of 3G network technologies at the regional level alongside Uruguay. The technology was subsequently exported to Brazil and Central America. We are one of the leading providers of 3G/LTE and mobile technologies in Ecuador.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Constitutional reforms gave new functions and obligations to the institution, and to the citizens of Ecuador. SUPERTEL supervises the entire telecommunications sector in both the public and private domains. We aim to give citizens control over public activities, while enhancing transparency by tackling the black economy. More players in the sector are an inevitability. Future services in Ecuador require operators, mainly established public ones, or those private operators already active here. This sector promises excellent investment opportunities, given the exponential demand growth for services.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Regarding the telecommunications field, we are expanding our internet services with fiber-optic technology and similar services to this, such as television through fiber optic, for example. Cuenca is already partly covered by a fiber-optic network. We are going to invest $9 million in 2013 and we will shortly offer fiber-optic television services. We would like to see our experience exported to the main cities and municipalities across the country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador is a market of operations that officially became part of Grupo Telefónica in 2005, when we launched Movistar in the country. Currently, Ecuador represents a very small market for the company. However, we have developed a very clear model for operations, and our results are an impressive benchmark for other regional markets. Therefore, the work done by the Ecuadorean team is highly recognized within the company.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Claro has always had, regardless of the social and political context of the country, one main strategy, which is constant investment in technology and human capital development. These have been the two pillars of América Móvil since it came to Ecuador in 2000. Ecuador is a very important market for América Móvil; the company's footprint in the country goes far beyond the telecommunications industry.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In Ecuador, the dynamics of the industry are very different to those of Colombia, Chile, and Peru, where the main industry players sign medium-term service contracts with freight forwarders and logistics providers of up to 12 months. Here, we call it a “spot market,“ where, in effect, clients tender each order, and basically whoever arrives at the best price wins the business. It is hard to project commercial relationships with a client in Ecuador for medium- to long-term periods. That is why, our focus over the next five years, will be on consolidating our client relationships. Our vision is to avoid constant participation in this bidding process, and to establish long-term commercial relationships. Another area where we are investing heavily as a group is IT, on internal systems and applications for our clients. We are currently developing software —a purchase order management system—for our clients. This tool will facilitate and streamline the entire process from purchase order through to shelf delivery, if necessary. It will also enable further long-term consolidation of our commercial relationships.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>If we compare the three countries in which Ransa operates, I would say that Ecuador is a much more formal market than Bolivia, although, in logistics terms, Peru is one step ahead of Ecuador. We have been operating in Ecuador for nine years now, having swiftly become a leading company in the sector. Many people still do not understand the concept of “logistics operator“, indicating a market yet to be explored, and offering business opportunities for a company to grow. In Peru, Ransa Logistics is well known as an operator that offers integrated solutions to key sectors of the national economy, such as mining and energy. Regarding the Ecuadorean market, we have focused on the mass consumer market, and not pursued the energy sector. We will continue strengthening our position in mass consumer market segments through investments in both perishable and non-perishable sub-segments: fleet, storage facilities, employees, and so on. We also plan to diversify our business activity in Ecuador and enter the mining, oil, and industrial segments—in which we already operate in Peru.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Under our group umbrella is CTK Logistics, a non-vessel operating common carrier and comprehensive logistics service provider. CTK handles every aspect of the logistics chain with a multimodal transport service.  It takes care of the entire supply chain for our clients. We look for the best rates for all of the trucking, both local and international, and negotiate the best freight rates with all major carriers. We move a lot of cargo from all over the US, Europe, and the Far East. CTK became involved in vessel chartering about three years ago. There is ever-growing local and international demand for specialized chartering services. Ecuador has very few companies doing this. Nowadays, it is increasingly common for an entire ship to be chartered to move one specific type of commodity. In 2012, we chartered 15 ships and brought in about 35,000 cubic meters of machinery. We also have road feeder services (RFS). This is a container yard for equipment maintenance and storage, serving the container fleets of some of the major shipping lines. We have a large capacity and facilities for reefers and dry containers.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Certain newly available services have either replaced others or offer an alternative to existing ones. We have the capacity to offer worldwide services. There are limitations, of course, and for example shipping lines like Maersk or MSC—the biggest in the world container wise—have substantial reefer equipment and space, and, therefore, a certain advantage when demand peaks. The past three or four years have been good, and for 2013 we expect similar results as in 2012 due to our business segment diversification. Our annual shipping revenues are at around $200 million. That means gross revenues of around $100 million from air traffic, rise to about $300 million including our other companies. Total gross revenues amount to roughly $350 million. We have new containers for reefer carriers that significantly preserve the shelf life of bananas, for example. Additionally, our advanced computer software facilitates the activities of importers and exporters, and we comply entirely with the new customs system. We also have a new electronic letter of delivery for cargo, whereby one click releases the container.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>IBM celebrated its 75th anniversary in Ecuador in 2012, and we have become the longest running IT company in the country, with no interruptions in our business activity whatsoever. The key to our overall success story in Ecuador is our human capital. Over the years, we have always been very strict in the recruiting process, and today we have a leading, qualified, and high-standard workforce that fills us with pride and honor. We know that every employee perfectly represents the values and missions of our company. When we first started operations, we were selling scales and typewriters, whereas today we provide integrated business solutions specifically designed to address the needs of our clients. Overall, IBM has achieved very important goals not only in Ecuador, but at the international level too. For example, we were part of the first human expedition to the moon; we created the barcode in 1973; and developed the first personal computer in 1981. Therefore, we are part of technological history and its greatest achievements. Back in the 1990s, we also underwent a transformation process, and adopted a new business model emphasizing the customer's needs and better understanding of the market. The transformation continues, as we are part of a very demanding and globalized world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>LG has its regional headquarters in Panama and Brazil; the former deals with the entire structural and organizational duties in the region, except in Brazil, which, for LG, has its own market and main headquarters within the country. This is due, mainly, to the size of the country and the market. It has already been 11 years since we started operations in Ecuador, and I am the fourth president of the company in the country. I have held this position since January 2012. In terms of sales, when we first started, we had a sales volume of $160,000, and we expect to close 2013 with $200 million worth of sales. As per market share, the average we hold, counting all segments and products of the industry, is around 38%; 40% in video and TV, and 23% in mobile telephony, a segment that we recently restructured in order to grab a higher market share and consolidate our presence in. In this context, image and sound, along with complementary technology, represent our most important business segment in Ecuador. Our main aim for the near future is to boost sales in the mobile telephone segment. Today, 90% of our sales in this particular segment are smartphones, and we want to further diversify our product portfolio to reach our goals.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are two main sectors that our partners and marketers have followed for many years. One is the private sector that focuses on banks, retail, telecommunications, commerce, and services, and the other is the state sector. Both are defined very clearly by us, and our approach is through several different strategies and tactics. We know how to operate these two main sectors, and all different kinds of commercial segments. In the early years, we were absolutely focused in terms of the photocopier business, which involved renting equipment. In the beginning, we actually just rented the machines without selling them. Nowadays, 90% of our business is no longer related to photocopiers. One might think our business would have lost significant revenue because, now, most of our communications are performed via the internet and e-mail. The question is what is Xerox's business today all about? Without question, it is digital.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TOWERING PERFORMANCE</h4><p>We have considerable experience in the hotel and the hospitality sectors. Our apartment buildings, too, prioritize customer comfort regardless of the scale. We are completing our largest project in Quito; San Martí­n, comprising 18 towers with 500 apartments, and housing our headquarters.<br></p><h4>ON THE DRAWING BOARD</h4><p>Our most important prospective project is the expansion of the Swissí´tel in Guayaquil; a $100 million investment with two towers of 40 stories each, including offices, apartments, and a hotel. We expect to commence work before the end of 2013.</p><h4>BUILDING JOBS</h4><p>Ecuador's real estate sector is growing rapidly on huge demand, much of it unsatisfied. Meanwhile, annual growth of 4%-6% brings greater employment, and with it, clients. The office segment is now entering the renting business, as foreign companies rarely buy space.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FULL CREDIT</h4><p>Recent years have seen a massive rise in credit. Today, around 80% of our clients' mortgages are granted by the IESS bank (BIESS). BIESS has therefore positively contributed to the social and economic development of Ecuadoreans by facilitating home ownership through credit lines.</p><h4>ALL MOD CONS</h4><p>The economic stability that followed dollarization in the early 2000s made loans more accessible. Today, most homebuyers expect projects to offer comprehensive facilities, such as landscapes, pools, sports, and security. The sector is also steadily growing thanks to infrastructural advances in Ecuadorean cities and provinces.</p><h4>IN DEVELOPMENT</h4><p>Currently, we are partnering in large residential projects, such as the Villa España 2, with 1,200 units. Among our own projects is the mid-to-high-end bracket Parque Magno, a residential scheme with approximately 40% landscaping and 130 homes. Our Jardines de Parque Magno will be very similar.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WHAT'S IN DEMAND?</h4><p>With over 30 years of experience we have specialized in the management of diverse real estate projects. These range from shopping malls, offices, apartments, and residential complexes, plus several niche markets. Today, the most demanded rank of properties ranges between $80,000 and $120,000, which we aim to meet.</p><h4>KEY HANDOVER</h4><p>We are developing three or four new residential complexes of between 12 and 15 hectares each. Construction of the Olivos del Rí­o residential complex will shortly commence, with delivery starting in late 2013. We are selling strongly across several projects, with construction planned for 2014.</p><h4>REAL ADVANTAGE</h4><p>The Real Estate Developers Association evaluates our challenges and seeks solutions, providing a unified image to the consumer. The government appreciates the importance of the construction sector in terms of economic activity and job opportunities. The Association liaises with it in advancing the business.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador's shrimp industry began in 1970, and after 40 years of production and exporting, the latest figures point exports of around $1.3 billion to more than 45 countries. Around half of these exports go to almost all of the 27 EU countries, while about 40% goes to the US. One of the main markets developing rapidly for us is Asia. This may be due in large part to the so-called early mortality syndrome (EMS), which is a major problem impacting that region's aquaculture industry. By the end of 2012, Asia represented 15% of our total exports, and from January to April 2013 the figure had reached 21%. We have very low-density production; we put about six to eight shrimp larvae in a cubic meter of water, whereas in Asia the number rises to 150 in the same amount of water. We are very environmentally aware, having reduced the number of larvae following widespread disease that damaged production in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In general, Asia and certain Latin-American countries experience serious hygiene problems that we do not. We have foreign investors in the shrimp feed sector. But it is not just a matter of bringing capital, but also knowledge to strengthen our industry. In the case of animal nutrition, it is crucial that we find better forms of nutrition to help the shrimp resist disease. In this regard, animal nutrition is focusing on replacing animal sourced protein to vegetable source protein.  We have many opportunities in this area.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Agripac started 40 years ago as a distributor of chemicals for the agricultural sector. The key is quality products, which we first imported from England and were specialized products not present in the country. Over the years, Agripac has tried to sell a complete package to the producers, which includes quality seeds, fertilizers, as well as all the different products to complete a package for bananas, cocoa, or any of the key products that Ecuador produces. In the beginning, Agripac focused more on maize, rice, and bananas; however, the company has grown and moved into different sectors and specialized local and international people in different areas. The main areas we are in are what we call ciclo corto, which is maize and rice, then bananas. The other area is shrimp. Agripac bought a feed manufacturing plant to produce shrimp and chicken feed. We bought that factory seven years ago. Seven years ago, it produced 30,000 bags of feed per month and in 2012 the average was 220,000 bags. In regards to money, six or seven years ago we sold approximately $3 million, and in 2012 we sold approximately $50 million in chicken and shrimp feed. Also, we started making dog and cat food.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We work in three main segments. One of them is fertilizers; we are importers, processors, and distributors for NPK fertilizers and for agricultural fertilizers and hold about 25% of the market. We move around 150,000 tons of fertilizer every year. This is our core business, and, through our trading network, we started to do the same for other commodities, such as wheat. We service the wheat market in terms of flour mills and feed mill plants for cattle, poultry, and other types of livestock. We have a 35% market share in that business. We also have two ports in order to receive all of the commodities that we handle, with proper storage. One of the ports, Ecuagran, handles our food division and the other port, Storeecean, handles incoming and outgoing goods to and from the Galápagos Islands. In fertilizers, we have developed a line for domestic use for gardens and lawns. It is sold in supermarkets, a segment of the market that needed attention. In terms of technology and R&amp;D, we speak with farmers, end-users, and our entire clientéle. Our team of technicians utilizes updated equipment, including GPS, to conduct soil analysis on site, and they can even map out a farmer's land through satellite technology and identify which soils are NPK deficient in order to assess what fertilizers should be used.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>My initial plan was to provide better healthcare to the inhabitants of Guayaquil, while contributing to improving the private and public healthcare system in our country. Over the years, we have improved our services and the application of new technology. We have also strengthened our ties with universities in order to contribute to the educational process of future doctors and specialists. We welcome final-year students from two of the leading higher education institutions in our country, and, several years ago, we established our own Master's degree in Medical Pathology and Anesthesiology. We have become a very reputable brand that works for the community, where patients can find the most advanced medical practices, highly qualified professionals, and a very efficient and effective hospital. The Ecuadorean health system has come a long way already and has improved its overall standards. Today, there are fewer Ecuadorean citizens who travel abroad for treatment. We need to strengthen the healthcare system in the rural areas of our country, because the people living there often lack access to healthcare resources. We need to strengthen educational programs to offer future doctors and specialists all the tools needed to become excellent professionals in Ecuador without leaving the country—those who left for other countries in order to pursue higher educational goals often stay there after they finish their studies.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We started our operations in June 2006. The idea behind the project was to provide the valley areas around Quito and its citizens with a high-quality hospital, as before the creation of our institution patients had to go into Quito itself. We saw a gap in the healthcare market in the area, and combined with the future prospects the new airport would bring, it was an attractive opportunity. We are a private institution within the healthcare sector with the largest open capital in Ecuador—there are 1,700 stakeholders invested in the hospital. This has afforded us the availability of funds to build up the hospital without interruption. Overall, I think the sector lacks experienced professionals, and, due to the complexity of our industry, that is a huge challenge. Regardless of how much you spend on technology and advanced equipment, if you don't have the right professionals and a well-planned strategy, investment is useless. That happens especially in the public sector, as the private sector, I believe, is one or two steps ahead. Our hospital has 570 employees, including 40 doctors and 250 attending doctors, who bring their own patients along with them to the hospital and use our infrastructure. We also employ some foreign professionals from countries such as Colombia, Spain, Peru, and Chile.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 1977, a group of optimistic leading physicians had the vision to build a hospital meeting international standards in Quito. Two years later, in a strategic and historic alliance between American Medical International (AMI) and CONCLINA CA, they initiated a project that would transform hospital medical care in the country. In 1982, construction on the hospital began and, three years later, Hospital Metropolitano opened its doors to the community. The Hospital has tried to grow beyond Quito, with special emphasis on rural areas of the country; however, inadequate administrative and economic resources hinder such expansion plans. Therefore, we are working on training programs outside Quito, and, given sufficient economic resources, we plan to open another hospital. Our focus today is on introducing state-of-the-art technology, withan estimated investment of $3 million a year. Being accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI) has confirmed our focus on the highest patient care standards and results, earning us the respect of healthcare leaders. JCI has also encouraged us to always pursue quality, safety, and efficiency in healthcare provision to global standards. It is also very important for the hospital to be able to offer highly specialized staff. We will therefore continue expanding our facilitates as the country continues to develop socially and economically, thus boosting the purchasing power of the middle class, our main patient group.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We had to go through a restructuring period, due to the growth of Ecuador. This growth is mainly due to the successful efforts of the Ministry of Tourism &amp; Culture. We did all the remodeling work in three months. Following this change, we grew by between 18% and 20%. Our growth was helped both by the growth of the industry, and by the remodeling work that we did. The rooms were the biggest change, with renovation of the 40 sqm plus bathrooms and the premium rooms receiving an anteroom and desks. Beyond that, the main change was in food and beverages, events, and conventions, with a growth in these areas of around 40%. Today, a corridor connects all six salons: Álamos has the capacity to host 120 people, and Robles 90 people, while we also have the Cedros, Arupos, Laureles, and the Cipreses and Pinos salons. We adapt our services to client demands, from coffee breaks to special champagne, petals on the floor, or the color of the chairs. We cater to all sorts of extravagant requests.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Hotel Dann Carlton Quito was essentially created to tend to the increasing business market in the city due to its location, which is key for the business today. The hotel is close to the most important Financial Center, main corporate offices and malls, as well as the main avenue, which is a fast link to the airport road. However, the hotel also attracts local and international companies, both medium and large, to host events, conferences, business meetings, product launches, and social occasions, among other events. The hotel also offers great local dishes and delicious international cuisine at Opera Restaurant and the new Luxemburgo Café. At the top of one of the towers, the hotel has a state-of-the-art gym and exercise area with a complete wet zone; sauna, Turkish bath, jacuzzi, massage rooms, and a fantastic indoor swimming pool. We also offer a professional squash court, lockers, and relaxation areas, among other services.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Grand Hotel Guayaquil crystallizes the best qualities of the other three hotels within our group, with both the tourist and business traveler in mind. The rich fabric of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, reflected in the traditional ambience of our hotel, is complemented by its location. We are a pleasant stroll away from several must-see attractions, among which are the Metropolitan Cathedral of Guayaquil and the Iguana Park. And of course, any visitor to our city must enjoy the Malecón 2000. This splendid urban renewal project has invigorated the former Simón Bolí­var boardwalk and stretches for an impressive 2.5 kilometers along the western shore of the River Guayas. A walk along it takes you past several of the key sites of Guayaquil's history. You can also stop off at museums and sculpted public spaces, or else indulge in shopping and local cuisine. For trips further afield, we are conveniently located for a visit to the geographical wonder of the Galápagos. You can also visit the historic center of Cuenca, Ecuador's third largest city, which is a World Heritage Site. Other areas of cultural interest include: Quito, the Amazon, and Vilcabamba.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Grupasa entered the Ecuadorean market in 1991. It was a time when Ecuador had a shortage of cardboard boxes and packages, and our company came to address that situation. Ever since then, Grupasa has been at the forefront of innovation in Ecuador and we have been the first in introducing many industrial practices and pioneering equipment in the country. For example, we have been pioneers in terms of printing and diversification of products, thanks to innovation—a key element in our business strategy. This is a very solid and competitive sector that requires all the players to keep up large production figures to generate interesting profits, as the margins are rather small. In this context, innovation is a key item in the industry, and every single company invests large amounts of money to push innovation and latest technology to the limit. Because of this, I think we will see companies doing what we currently do; trying to differentiate their activities from those of their competitors by building a brand. For example, we have long established our own R&amp;D development that pushes innovation forward in all the areas possible: production, diversification, exports, and the rest.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The República de Cacao initiative began when we realized that in Europe the consumption of dark chocolate had been growing for at least 15 years. In the beginning, it is often hard to tell if consumption growth is a trend and the question is always, “how long it will last?“ However, we determined that sugarless chewing gum and dark chocolate were here to stay and that the segments would continue to grow. Up until 1930, Ecuador was one of the top exporters of cocoa, and I have a great-grandfather who was also an exporter. The success of the country was nearly ruined in the 1920s due to plant illnesses that destroyed the crops. Since then, cocoa has always been on our minds. My family recognized the potential when Ecuador's cocoa was identified and appreciated among chocolate lovers and experts. The same happened in the segment of cheese and a variety of other products, which could be produced and exported at a good price. In the past, we exported cocoa beans and then bought them back as chocolate at a high price. In that respect, luxury chocolate was never a product for the Ecuadorean market. By 2008, we had taken our product to Germany, where the largest candy show in the world happens every year in Cologne. As a brand, República de Cacao made an unbelievable impact at the show.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>For Cervecerí­a Nacional (CN), R&amp;D does not only mean new products and bottle designs. Innovation begins with the selection of new and higher quality raw materials, improvements in the production chain, and market research. Over the last few years, we have expanded our product portfolio importantly and since 2005, we have invested over $400 million to achieve a world class manufacturing process, with new bottling lines, distribution centers, our carrier fleet and new product development. This investment has also enabled us to increase production and at the moment we are producing over 6 million units per year. We currently work at 90% capacity. It is important to stress the point that CN has identified the main trends and preferences of the market and carried out investments toward supplying the market and consumers with their desired products. In addition, our activities have had great impact on the national economy; for example, in 2012, we contributed over $247 million in taxes, both directly and indirectly, when in 2006 the figures stood at $125 million. In terms of employment, we have a direct staff body of 1,917 people, and provide a work for well over 22,330 people throughout the distribution chain.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Starting a major project like this is always difficult in any part of the country. In the case of Coca Codo, the most difficult part was reaching the critical areas of the project on an insufficient road system, such as the power plant, and the site of the tunnel boring work.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company works in different areas of finance and economics, where we have an AAA+ rating qualification of international standard. We also work with organizational plans within the Great Place to Work scheme, and currently rank as the second best company to work for. For us, it is very important to make our employees feel comfortable and appreciated in their workplace, which increases productivity rates and, at the end of the day, we believe that the employees are the ones that take care of the company, and not the other way around. Finally, we are very committed to corporate social responsibility (CSR). We received the highest qualification from the Dutch Global Reportable Initiative (GRI). Therefore, we can proudly say today that we are a comprehensive and integrated company. That's our business strategy, as we establish close links with society. Our products are transparent and understandable, because we want to knock down old stereotypes regarding the insurance business, such as the proverbial small print. That has helped us to build a distinctive and trustworthy brand in the market. Our business model is very distinctive and we do not view any other insurance company as a competitor, as we believe that we can build a strong community.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, we are celebrating our 40th anniversary. In early 1970, Quito experienced a trend toward the development of new business activities little known in the country. In this context, Seguros Generales Equinoccial was established in 1973. Over the years, the company expanded its operations into numerous insurance segments. It became crucial to enter new fields of the insurance industry, without neglecting traditional segments. Duly, the company has been a pioneer in the fields of bonds, risk insurance products for oil companies, and special hazards, among others, becoming a notable industry player in terms of production, financial soundness, and volume of business assets. Seguros Equinoccial has set the benchmark in terms of quality services and a high sense of professionalism in Ecuador's major cities: Quito, Guayaquil, Cuenca, Manta, Ambato, Ibarra, Riobamba, and Loja. In 1997, the company entered a new era based on an ambitious strategic plan to improve services and create value-added. Having initially worked with Ecuador's public sector, the focus shifted to the private sector. In terms of individual business growth our main goal was market leadership. We currently have a market share of close to 10%.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ours is a very singular market. Being as small as it is with $1.5 billion in underwriting premiums (three times smaller than Peru and five times smaller than Colombia), 45 insurance companies, and more than 600 retail brokers compete for a piece of the pie.  Over the years our clients have grown both knowledgeable and demanding in their request for service and specific solutions for complex risk. We offer a complete range of options that emphasize the financial strength of the insurance issuer and the versatility of the services and coverage offered. Our size and expertise make us attractive for both client and underwriter alike. It's necessary to underline that our model of claim handling has made a big difference in the market: we follow the whole process of claim adjusting giving the client and the adjustors full advice in the documentation of the claim, and our interpretation of the scope of risks covered by the policy. Once the claim reaches the insurance company there are rarely any misunderstandings remaining. It's just a matter of fulfilling the promise and paying the claim. We are a corporate broker, and 60% of our income stems from this segment alone. We are focused on engineering, airport infrastructure (brokers to Jose Joqaquin de Olmedo airport in Guayaquil), construction risk, fire lines, cargo, and large sureties and performance bonds.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We were established 27 years ago after seven insurance companies united efforts, along with other key players in the national insurance market foresaw the opportunity of setting up a common company focused on bond insurance. I arrived at Confianza in 1999, at a time when Ecuador was suffering from a severe economic crisis where 15 banks closed down. Seguros Confianza has expanded its activity and presence in the market over the years. Today, we hold a 24% market share in the bond insurance segment, which is highly competitive in Ecuador. Over the past decade, we have also expanded our geographical presence; our headquarters are in Quito, and we have offices in Guayaquil and Cuenca. Our professional business structure and specialization in bond insurance are two of our greatest competitive advantages. We are able to better advise our clients, offering them products and services with added value. We always say that we grow along with our clients, and specialization is key. Diversification, for us, is applied within the segment we operate in.  We are focusing our growth on market share in the private companies sub-segment. Today, our main clients are private companies, whereas the main beneficiary of our policies is the state.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>In the case of Ecuador and similar markets, AIG targets individuals with more innovative and competitive products. In Ecuador, we have two main business segments; the commercial line, including the corporate market, multinationals and consumers, or individuals. The company is implementing an aggressive growth strategy for the next five years to increase its corporate and individual client base. Our major project is the implementation of an accelerated growth plan with a core strategy of geographic expansion. Rapidity and efficiency are two of our primary strengths; our main goal is to provide rapid solutions to our clients whenever they are needed. Our future strategy, therefore, aims to bolster our broker network to reach more clients. There is a clear benefit in being part of a leading international insurance organization with the largest network of any insurance company, a presence in 130 countries, and more than 70 million clients. This is especially true in a market where the presence of multinationals in the insurance business has grown considerably in recent years. The company has always been a leading insurance institution in the Ecuadorean market, and my main goal is to double our profits and business volume, and achieve a $130 million turnover in five years' time. We are on the right path to achieve this.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Ecuadorean market is very traditional for the large part. Most people like quality. Chinese products are not that popular as they are in Peru and other countries. People like quality, reliability, and they want to know who is behind the product. My clients like to have products with good support and after-sales service. They know we have a tradition of quality. Our main business strategy is based on quality and distribution, and here there is no stationery store that does not carry BIC. We are like Coca-Cola in the traditional stores. We have 120 people working in Ecuador, 60 in Peru, and 30 in Chile. We have to develop people, and bring the best out of each one. If you want to develop the company and its market share, you have to train people to match the company's goals. We have to understand the personal, family, and professional goals of each person. We have to develop people to their highest potential. The second goal is to keep the factory here in Ecuador. We have won prizes as the best production company with the keenest costs, lowest rate of incidents, and lowest absenteeism; we have a lot of things to be proud of, and we have to keep it that way.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We need to have products that are dedicated to the Ecuadorean market and the greater Andean region. For example, in the truck tire market we developed products based on the terrain, streets, and geography of the region. For tires that are produced for Cuenca, which is at 2,600 meters altitude, or even Quito, trucks are carrying imports and exports that are delivered through Guayaquil. This means that transportation companies need to be able to handle travel at 3,000 meters to sea level in about 300 kilometers. Comparing that to the flat terrain of the Midwest US, where trucks travel for 1,000 kilometers without even a curve in the road, it is completely different from what we need to do in Ecuador. Even in the Colombian market, the surroundings are so different from other parts of the world that we need to produce specialized compounds for our tires. Our main advantage is that we have a centralized team that knows our geography very well. We are working to improve our financial performance. Over the last year, we have grown significantly compared to our 2008 sales figures—we saw a sales increase of more than 300% in the Andean region. In addition, the company has witnessed a significant volume increase based on a $50 million investment made in the last four to five years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We entered the Ecuadorean market 18 years ago, and have been operating in two main segments: diapers and bathroom tissues. Today, we are a leading company in the market with our consumer brands known worldwide, such as Huggies®, Kleenex®, Scott®, Kotex®, Poise®, Kimberly-Clark Professional®, Flor®, Jackson Safety®, Kleenguard®, and Wypall®. For example, in Ecuador we own 71% of the market in the diapers segment, 49% in bathroom tissues, and 27% of the market in the sanitary products for women segment. Over the years, we have also invested significantly in a production facility in Ecuador. At the moment, we produce mainline diapers (we only import premium products in this range) and certain sanitary products. Quality standards are one of our main concerns and focuses, and we invest every year in making sure that we present our clients with products meeting the highest quality standards. Our mission is to lead the world in essentials for a better life.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Mabe was founded in Mexico in the 1960s by two family members, Mabardi and Berrondo. They started by manufacturing cooking stoves, and at the end of the 1980s they entered into a joint venture with a US company, General Electric, to manufacture appliances and home goods in Mexico for the US market. The company grew exponentially and started entering different markets in Latin America, firstly Venezuela in around 1993, then Colombia in 1995, and Ecuador and Peru soon after. In Ecuador, it bought an established company, Electrodomesticos Durex, which was the country's leading home appliance manufacturer. A joint venture with the owners of the company was agreed and they started to manufacture, import, and sell their products in the local market as well as exporting them to different markets. We have been in Ecuador for 18 years now. In Ecuador, the construction industry is increasing and there is a lot of demand; however, there is no culture of selling the units with the appliances, unlike in Mexico and Colombia. This is changing though, and as a manufacturer we are doing our best to convince people that this is a very good way to differentiate ourselves from our competitors.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>McDonald's is the largest chain of quick-service hamburger restaurants in the world, serving around 68 million customers a day in 119 countries. Richard and Maurice McDonald started the company in the 1940s in the US as a small barbeque restaurant. In 1948, the McDonald's brothers restructured their business, focusing on hamburger sandwiches prepared under assembly line principles. In 1955, businessman Ray Kroc joined the company as a franchisee, and eventually bought out the chain from the McDonald's brothers. Thanks to his business vision, he oversaw McDonald's development and worldwide expansion. Today, the company has an annual turnover of around $80 billion, China being the fastest growing market. McDonald's arrived in Ecuador in 1997, many years after entering South America. The company was looking for a local partner and I became personally interested and decided to lead this attractive venture, leaving behind more than 20 years of banking experience. In February 1997, I flew to Caracas, Venezuela, to train at a restaurant for six months. Later, I went to Chicago for further training at the McDonalds Hamburger University. With that experience, we set up our local headquarters in Guayaquil in 1997, our first restaurant opened in Quito in October, and 30 days later we opened in Guayaquil.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have introduced several innovative products, one of which is called Cuenta Óptima. The tool functions as a second checkbook that has an automatic overdraft facility, but does not use any credit account. Instead, it draws from a parallel account. In the market it is recognized as the same check, so you are not doing business with an overdraft, but instead with your own current account. It is very convenient for small businesspeople whose cash flow varies. If their cash flow is low, they can use their overdraft facility, which is pre-approved, by issuing a check. This is a very successful product that we offer small companies. We also have introduced Flexiahorro, a product that creates a savings discipline, becoming the solution for families who recognize the importance of saving. Another new product is Cashback, a credit card reward program that returns 1% of the value of the customer's consumption.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The banking system in Ecuador can be seen as strong and solvent, able to adapt quickly to the demands of both the market and regulatory bodies. That's mainly thanks to responsible and prudent management; in Banco Capital's case this has allowed us to stay in the financial sector for 20 years, with financial indices that are even above the system average. However, 2013 will be a year in which generating higher returns will be a major challenge. Also, credit placement slowed down in 2012, especially in the consumer segment, and that will have to be analyzed very carefully to avoid affecting the quality of the portfolio. However, we are aware that the financial margins of institutions must be addressed strategically; having maximum rates regulated by regulatory bodies, these must be properly managed versus borrowing rates on deposits.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our success is based on prioritizing our clients' best interests. As the second largest bank in the country, we remain at the forefront of the financial sector with high levels of liquidity, and good efficiency and credibility rates. We are the first and only Ecuadorean bank with a stable AAA risk grade. As the most innovative financial institution in Ecuador we are also developing a pioneering paycheck system aimed primarily at helping SME's and distributors to streamline transactions with their employees and suppliers. Additionally, our mobile banking project, a key element of our business strategy, makes our payment and transfer services accessible 24/7, both in Ecuador, and abroad. Our recently launched Smartphone app provides the user with information on their current balances, the nearest ATMs, and branch working hours and services.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, Banco del Pacifico has played a key role in modernizing Ecuador's banking industry through the application of modern technologies. Recently we have supported strategic economic sectors defined by the government as Ecuador's productive matrix changes. Throughout 2012 and 1H2013, we have expanded our network of banking correspondents to up to 1,700 to enhance banking penetration, giving special attention to middle to lower classes of the population, particularly  in remote locations. We currently rank second amongst Ecuador's largest banks—we have a (AAA-) risk rating, the evolution of our financials has been consistently positive, and our wide range of financial resources provides funds for short-, medium-, and long-term needs. We serve all sectors of the economy and our diverse product range meets the needs of our multi-target customer base. As a universal bank, we provide services to all clients: SMEs, corporate, consumer and retail loans, mortgages, credit cards, and micro credits.</p>]]></sections31>

Now, we're discussing how we can enhance our bilateral cooperation. Ecuador has a lot of business with Spain, and I believe that it can be a good Latin American partner for other EU member states.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I want to emphasize the unity of two peoples who are born of the same origin; Ecuador and Peru. we are now concerned about doing everything necessary to build the path to union. Today, we tell Ecuadorean and Peruvian entrepreneurs to invest, in Peru and in Ecuador, because the two are going to ensure fair, honest treatment with respect to labor rights and guarantee that their investment will be fruitful.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We enjoy a friendly relationship that has been established for many years, and each country attained independence in solidarity with the other. I would especially like to emphasize our cooperation in the environmental arena, which continues to command our partnership. Ecuador and Costa Rica have initiated very effective programs in terms of reforestation. These efforts are dedicated to the protection of our forests and jungles, as well as the tropical Pacific region, which we consider to be of particular importance.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are in the Middle East and Africa, which are really the only remaining growth opportunities in the world. We have double-digit growth here in Dubai and the UAE, and this is really sustainable growth, too. Due to bothpast and projected growth, we have taken on a lot of importance, so CEOs here report directly to the global CEO. We have been allocated substantial investments, and we have just started breaking ground on a $100 million ground-operations facility. We have also just expanded to Egypt. However, we are not just investing in infrastructure; we also have to invest in our fleet, both in terms of aircraft and ground vehicles, and start new routes, such as between the US and Bahrain. We run a two-tier hub model in the Middle East. Dubai is our commercial hub, and we utilize its wonderful flight connections to the region and serve about 200 flights a day. Bahrain works as our intercontinental hub. It is a mix of both, though, as we have large aircraft coming in from Europe en route to Asia, and we have 757s shuttling between Dubai and Bahrain. We run on both hubs. Dubai is a transit hub for shipments from Asia into the Middle East, and we use it as our own hub for distribution in the region, and then Bahrain is the entry point, especially for Saudi Arabia.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are pioneers of e-commerce in terms of connectivity in the Middle East. We started our work serving this sector about 10 years ago, connecting shoppers from the East who wanted to purchase goods from the US, and the model continues to expand. We have witnessed many entrepreneurs entering the market and this continues to be the case, in addition to the increasing confidence of consumers in online purchasing. We have been developing Aramex as a brand over the last 30 years, and we are proud to be serving most of the e-commerce players that operate in the region. When it comes to the future of the sector in the region, the outlook is extremely promising. E-commerce has been growing by between 30% and 40% a year, and we are witnessing what could be described as an explosion of e-commerce across the region. The same can be said about the growth of e-commerce in Russia, Africa, East Asia, and in every region we go to. The population in these regions is quite young, and consumer habits are changing. Young people buy things online, and if they buy once, they will buy again. We continue to invest in this sector because we see significant growth, and we want to make sure that every time our customers order online we are there. We are offering solutions that include warehousing, stock management, replenishment, and the full integration of services.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our operations mainly focus on air transportation; however, we cannot solely focus on just air, and we have to take land and sea transportation into consideration as well. Our operations from Al Maktoum International Airport in Dubai World Central (DWC), Jebel Ali have been instrumental in contributing toward the expansion of our growth to become the largest freight operator at the airport. We wanted to be close enough to perform all forms of trade logistics. We evaluated the other emirates within the UAE, but found that Jebel Ali in Dubai was the most conducive for our multi-modal air, land, and sea operations. We consulted our largest client and offered to bring the freight by sea into Jebel Ali, and then fly it to Afghanistan, and vice versa. The concept was agreed on by the client, and that was the start. Given the excellent multi-modal infrastructure of DWC, we decided to consolidate all our efforts around Al Maktoum International Airport. Since the opening of the airport in May 2011, National Air has become the lead operator with over 2,500 flights operated to date. In order to further fully facilitate an expanded service in Dubai, we have announced the construction of our own $50 million, 40,000 sqm warehousing facility.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Cellempower has been in Dubai for eight years, and it was one of the first companies to launch value-added services and educate clients and consumers that mobile devices are great for content, applications, information, and entertainment. While doing this, we had to partner with many companies of different sizes, either on the content and application, or the technology and platform side, transferring knowledge and know-how. A few set up their regional operations thanks to the positive business environment in Dubai. This is an indirect contribution to IT and the development of the sector. We also try to evangelize and promote IT and telecommunications, while our turnover and sales realized in Dubai and the UAE make a tangible contribution. Being a small company, our average sales for the past two years were around $2.5 million. In short, I hope Dubai recognizes the valuable strategy of embracing ICT, and of becoming the future hub for ICT across the region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Cyber Gear started in February of 1996, meaning that having been in business for 17 years; we are as old as the internet itself. Our business is designing websites, intranets, and knowledge portals. We work extensively with the government, as well as with several multinationals and best-of-breed organizations in the region. We conduct internet marketing campaigns that help our clients' brand building activities online, and essentially all aspects of that medium are within our portfolio. Cyber Gear has worked with Duty Free, British Airways, FedEx, Hyatt Hotels and Resorts, as well as Total, and many other multinationals. We are currently developing a knowledge portal for the healthcare industry and are working with leading hospitals in the region. The unique thing about Cyber Gear as an SME is that we have never canvassed for business, but grown purely through referrals. One happy camper brings another, and that is how we have grown into of the largest internet services companies in the region.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are referred to as a “gold partner." For the past five years, we have been nominated for the Partner of the Year Award. Achieving that kind of performance level in itself is a great thing. The way we differentiate ourselves is in the partnerships that we develop with our vendors. It is not a case of the vendor providing opportunities to the partner, but actually the other way around. We are so taken with the market that we have account management and service delivery layers. Partners do not invest much in these account management profiles, which are getting closer to the customer. Therefore, we identify more opportunities for our vendors as opposed to vendors providing opportunities for us. Our alignment with industry trends is also significant. Considering the industry trends today regarding cloud computing, people have concerns about security, mobility, and unified communication. Having identified these areas, if a company does not provide a solution for my customer, then there is a need for me to create an alliance with another company that does provide a more complete alternative. We take these propositions and value-added to Microsoft vendors, which value our service.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The Dubai SME100 sought to identify Dubai's top SMEs that are role models the Emirate could be proud of. Beginning with only one retail store in 1994, today we are proud to say that we have grown into a multi-million-dirham company. Out of the 75,000 participants, not only were we ranked 51st, but we were also awarded the Best Retailer of the Year 2010 by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Subsequently, we were the only telecoms organization to be ranked in the top 100. Within a year, we were also recognized at the SME Arabia 500, which took place in Turkey. The following year, HiPHONE Telecom was ranked 4th in the SME Arabia 500 (UAE). These rankings were based on 2009-2011 turnovers. Today, we are located at every distinguished mall in the country. Through hard work, we have created a brand image and identity that differentiates us from our competition. We eventually decided to create our own brand, iSafe. The iSafe brand launched mobile products such as covers, chargeable handy battery cover devices, and other accessories.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We are targeting to promote and establish an electronic products manufacturing industry in the region using the A-Z philosophy. Despite the challenges that this industry faces, we are confident that, with the support of the government, we will be successful in establishing a cluster for this industry capable of exporting the technology developed in Dubai, and providing technical know-how to countries to set up production facilities. We are also targeting to overcome the limited volume of high tech equipment in this region, such as the SMT machines we have in Belgium. There is currently no support for such high tech equipment here in Dubai, which is one of the main difficulties that other talented people face when trying to establish this type of industry in the region. Throughout 2013, we are targeting to receive greater support from financial institutions in support of our plan to increase production and hire more senior staff for the business operation. There is demand, but at the same time limited production space. It is very expensive to operate in Jebel Ali, although being based in Dubai is certainly better and cheaper in terms of being a trading hub. Here we have people, neighbors, and technical staff, and are close to many markets, although we lack a solid infrastructure for this industry. We expect to grow by at least 100% over 2013, as long as everything goes to plan.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ABSOLUTE STRENGTH</h4><p>Competition forces every company to develop additional ideas, better services, and a higher-quality service. Businesses seek alternative means for value-added solutions for their clients. This is one of the absolute strengths of the SSI Schaefer team and its organization.</p><h4>GLOBAL PLAYERS</h4><p>Dubai has all of the global players, with many of our global key accounts operating right next door. We work very closely with these global players to determine the solution that we can deliver and to develop new strategies.</p><h4>ALWAYS THERE</h4><p>Local transportation is definitely a significant challenge that has to be addressed. Dubai has always come up with ideas and solutions, and if there is a demand, the local government has always provided the infrastructure to solve that problem.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SELF-DETERMINED</h4><p>We have seen growth of between 20% and 30% in our revenue streams, whether in volumes or in business. We've increased our market share within the self-storage industry, and we are one of the leaders thanks to our expandable capacity and growing self-storage facility.</p><h4>PRODUCT MIX</h4><p>The product mix is the differentiating factor in our business model versus other logistics players. We tend to cover most of the spectrum, but not all of it, as we don't yet have cold storage. However, we do have climate-controlled storage.</p><h4>FILLING THE GAP</h4><p>We cater to a certain type of client that requires storage within the UAE—we are talking about cargo that has already been cleared. That is the niche we chose from the start, because we found that there was a gap in the sector.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE FIGURES</h4><p>With Dubai positioned as a major global logistics hub, competition on the ground in terms of logistics service providers is high. In Dubai alone, there are approximately 3,845 freight-forwarders in a city with a population of 1.3 million.</p><h4>SPECIALIST SKILLS</h4><p>As this region diversifies its products and services, the need is growing for more specialized supply chain skills. We are ideally positioned to leverage this growth and we see many exciting opportunities ahead for our clients and our own business in this region.</p><h4>FLOW GROWTH</h4><p>Even though the European economic situation is still negatively impacting trade volumes through Dubai, it is encouraging to see pre-recession volumes returning to the region, which shows that growth in other emerging market regions is flowing through Dubai.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>PHILOSOPHY</h4><p>The core idea was to support executives. We looked for synonyms for “support," but they were all too cheesy. However, a lynchpin is an important thing; it keeps things focused toward the center, and so we used that.</p><h4>CLIENTS</h4><p>Students sometimes join us after a break of maybe 10 or 15 years working within their field. Over the past four years, we have had more than 2,000 students enrol. We expect that 2013 will be just as successful, if not more, than previous years.</p><h4>PARTNERS</h4><p>We have just signed an agreement with Docebo, an Italian company, and shall represent its Learning Management platform in the UAE and other GCC countries. The focus is on compliance, anti-money laundering (AML), and due diligence; things that are very popular with banks that cannot send all of their staff on training at once.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LEADERS</h4><p>One thing that we cannot deny is that the leadership here has created an environment safe for investors. In doing so, the administration has effectively created a headquarters for the Middle East and Africa.</p><h4>MIXING POT</h4><p>There are well over 100 different nationalities in Dubai. This means that one of the challenges is trying to maintain a balance of nationalities within an organization.</p><h4>VISION</h4><p>In 2013, we are focusing on making a stronger impact in sectors we have a limited presence in, such as oil and gas. We will also grow the teams in some of our offices.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>FOCUS</h4><p>There are many business sectors still dominated by monopolies in the region, and this has created a lack of space for new entrepreneurs. There needs to be a transfer of opportunity from the older generations to the younger ones if more business and employment opportunities are to be created in the private sector.</p><h4>DEMOGRAPHY</h4><p>There are fantastic opportunities regards reaping a potential demographic dividend over the next decade in terms of an emerging very young, dynamic, and highly educated workforce.</p><h4>DOERS</h4><p>The region's labor market is quite unique compared to anywhere else in the world, and as a “think" and “do" tank we aim to focus not merely on best practice, but also the most relevant practice.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>ENABLERS</h4><p>A major part of our business now is helping companies that have customer relationship management (CRM) systems in place. We have found time and time again that sales people often don't use CRM systems, and gain no value from them.</p><h4>WISDOM</h4><p>If sales people feel like they are part of it, they will run with it. People hate being told what to do. They will shy away from it unless they feel like they are a part of it.</p><h4>OPPORTUNITIES</h4><p>There are many SMEs in Dubai, and the large majority of them need help to grow their businesses, which presents us with a fantastic opportunity.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>Why is the GCC market looking so promising for Roche?</h4><p>If we look at it from a global perspective, we see that growth is shifting toward emerging markets such as the Middle East, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and particularly Asia, and we have a very good footprint in these markets. We established this early, and we want to continue to invest and build our franchise in these markets. I think that strategy is very similar for the mature and developing markets, and for us, the strategy is built on two pillars. One is building efficiency, making sure that our solutions and systems provide efficiency to customers, and the other is to build on the medical value that is providing increasing answers for physicians to treat patients. Both of these pillars then work to increase our ability to provide the best possible diagnosis and, ultimately, to help patients.</p><h4>What do you see is the biggest opportunity in the GCC region?</h4><p>I see many opportunities, which is typical for growth regions. I think one very important opportunity is the fact that the governments around the region continue to invest in healthcare, which is a great opportunity for us. In terms of diagnostics, we are always early in the investment cycle, especially for healthcare systems. We also see the opportunity to take one or two steps at once. Total lab automation, which is a major trend in the region at this stage, is something that we could provide tremendous expertise in to our clients. At the same time, we also believe that there are more people in the region who have access to healthcare. Our responsibility is to provide them with high-quality diagnostics and healthcare solutions.<br></p><h4>What are the key strengths of Roche's offering to the healthcare industry?</h4><p>Allow me to mention two elements. One is structure and infrastructure; we are an established organization here, we have been here for many years, and we remain close to our customers and have our own employees in this market. Being close to the customer and knowing what the customer needs is paramount. The other element is the fact that our solutions can be modelled around what our customers really need. Through our modular offerings we can cover basically all the needs that customers have. From a technology perspective, it's really important because we understand that customers are different and we want to provide them with different solutions that really fit their requirements.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>How long has Roche been involved with markets in the Middle East?</h4><p>Our history in the Middle East actually dates back to 1978. In that year, we established our first regional office presence here in the Middle East, which back in those days opened in Amman. I remember vividly because I had the honor to be part of the team to also visit Riyadh in 1980, where we then opened our first office in Saudi Arabia. For us, as an agency, it is paramount to be present in markets that have come a long way and where we have been a part of this development.</p><h4>How is this relationship going to evolve?</h4><p>What you see today is that Roche Diagnostics is present basically all over the Middle East, in 20 countries with our own people and organization. This shows the dedication and development that we saw, and that then resulted in us increasing our presence in the Middle East. We have to be where our patients and customers are, and this is a commitment that we have always been striving to achieve.</p><h4>What sort of potential do you see in the Middle East region?</h4><p>We are shifting the company from being a centralized organization to a decentralized one, as is the case in the Middle East, because our business units in the region are now standing alone. Of course, these processes can be a little bit painful for the people directly affected by them. However, when you want to achieve a business goal and you have been building up a presence like we have over the last few decades, I think it's a logical step to take. This exercise in the Middle East would not have been possible without the full dedication of the team here. When I mean the full team, I mean all of Roche's Middle East team. What has been accomplished over the last few years, especially over the last year or two, is really outstanding.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4>Since you have the hands-on experience in this region being the general manager and leading the management center, what is the importance of this market to you?</h4><p>Market demand has evolved over time, and many of the governments in the GCC region are upgrading their healthcare systems to meet the level of local demand. This means that our offerings and services in these markets need to meet the standards expected from the people here. It's actually sometimes more challenging to bring a healthcare system up to a higher level than to maintain a higher level in the first place. We have to be there, we have to be very close to the demand in the market, and we have to take our decisions accordingly. The management center provides us with the structure to build and to maintain in the region all the support functions that we need. As well, our logistics management center owns and maintains a stock of agents that allows us to very quickly react to any kind of situation or demand that may occur in the region. It also allows us to maintain our quality standards for all our customers in the Middle East. Although we are doing very well in 2013, we should not forget that we are well known in the market and that we have customers who invest a lot of trust in us. We have to fulfill these expectations, so we always have to work to higher standards and keep in mind that at the end of what we do there is the patient. We are not dealing with something that is exchangeable; we are selling something that someone—often in a very bad situation—needs to improve their quality of life, and that is our drive every day.</p><h4>How have Roche's operations in Dubai evolved?</h4><p>We received our trade license in January 2012, and our first milestone was to go commercially live in July. This is basically an internal process that allows us to buy and sell our products in the region through this office. That means Roche Diagnostics Middle East Regional Company is now the commercial partner of all our distributors in the region. This first milestone was met and from there we have launched some initiatives that are part of the overall concept. Among other things, in September 2012, we kicked off our Middle East marketing team, to transfer all market support activity to Dubai for the 20 countries in the Middle East. Before this, the marketing experts in the export department in Germany were covering the region as part of a portfolio of 70 markets, including Eastern Europe, most parts of Africa, and the Middle East. Now, we have specialized marketing and product management, focusing on the specific needs of the Middle East. In November 2012, we launched our regional warehouse in Jebel Ali, where we now centrally store the products designated to the region, allowing us to act faster and more reliably. We are also controlling a longer part of the distribution chain. Previously, we were sending the goods out of our central warehouse in Europe, so the moment the goods left the warehouse, they were in the hands of our distributers. Now, we carry the whole responsibility until it arrives here, which improves quality control over the supply chain. This is not only about costs, but it is primarily about better serving customers.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our experience at the Arab Health Exhibition confirmed the extent to which the region is growing in importance as a leader in the provision of solutions to the unique challenges facing infrastructure and resources.  At Philips, our goal is to make the world healthier and more sustainable through innovation, and we want to start right here in the Middle East. Arab Health provides a great platform on which to meet customers and governments to better understand the challenges they are facing, and to ascertain how Philips, as an innovations company, can assist with this. In 2013, the event was very significant in terms of attendees, and illustrated the great importance that all stakeholders are giving to improving healthcare services across the Middle East. During Arab Health 2013, Philips chose to focus on oncology across the care spectrum, from prevention services all the way through to treatment and after care. We are also interested in understanding how diseases manifest themselves differently in the region. One of the unfortunate traits being recognized by researchers is that, relatively speaking, breast cancer starts very early in the Gulf when compared with other regions of the world. We know that the chances of surviving breast cancer improve significantly the earlier the disease is diagnosed, and so, together with governments, Philips is committed to actively getting women to be screened.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>If we fast-forward a few years in the lifetime of a hospital that has begun using electronic systems, we conclude that we can do far more with the data, as it works in an accumulative-build environment. Once the data is categorized into large blocks, you can use it to perform research that will benefit the population. The main thing any government is concerned about in regard to healthcare is quality and cost control. The US is particularly vocal about this aspect, as it spends 17.5% of its GDP on healthcare, but it is still concerned about quality, and wants to maintain a good level of control. With these large data stores, you can see things you can't see at individual hospitals; this allows for predictive analysis. Therefore, in a healthy environment, you can identify people who are likely to become sick. We can then start treating people actively instead of reactively. A hospital is a reactive model, because it doesn't assist patients until they show up unwell; it would be great if the hospitals could be more active.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The leadership in Dubai is actively driving the development of the healthcare sector. The country and the Emirate have developed in a relatively short period of time, and we have seen many investments and substantial infrastructural improvements. Many of those investments have since matured, and the Emirate now has solid infrastructure to support further growth across a wide range of sectors, including healthcare. However, while there are new hospitals being constructed, Rome wasn't built in a day. Building a hospital takes on average a couple of years, but then comes the difficult part: hiring qualified human resources to run it. Hospitals need doctors, and it takes five or six years just to complete medical school. The challenge is to get people up to speed, and up to a world-class standard. After university, it can take a further five or 10 years to specialize. This is a challenge; however, we see a lot more attention being given to this issue by the Emirate's leadership. For example, at Arab Health, Her Royal Highness Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein spoke about the importance of the healthcare sector in driving Dubai's development.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The initial concept was conceived in around 2007. Many cranes stopped working in Dubai for a long period of time; however, they then started up again, and faster than before. We have really stepped up the pace recently in terms of development and technology. I joined a year and a half ago and began on the construction site. We had, at any given time, about 3,000 people working, and they were making really good progress. You see quite a few projects in Dubai that start well but then get delayed. Here, we have an owner who really wanted to benefit from a quick turnaround and make a statement. There is no better place than Dubai to make that statement. We are targeting the luxury business traveler. This does not mean, however, that we are not in the leisure or tourist market. Today's business traveler is tomorrow's leisure traveler and vice versa. Primarily, we are targeting the lucrative and increasingly important international MICE market. This sector is picking up, and the landscape is changing. Now, we have meetings coming in from South America and Russia. This is due to Dubai's infrastructure and location, and the fact that people recognize that there is more to Dubai than just beaches. Many still think of Dubai as a place for a sunny vacation and shopping, but there are business meetings being held here as well. We can even host meetings in July and August, as we are fully air-conditioned.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We see very high demand in the five-star market. In the near future, the authorities are planning to classify five-star hotels in sub-segments and specializations. All of the five-star hotels will be specialized, so if a company operates a hotel on the beach it will be considered a resort. Hotels located in the city, such as the Millennium Plaza, will be classified as business hotels. Were we to open a conference facility, we would be considered a business and conference hotel. This is one part of the new classification system, but it will also extend to the service level of five-star hotels. We recently renewed our license for the second year. As we are a five-star brand, it takes a great effort from the team and the government to maintain our quality. Huge efforts have been made to change the way that we drive the business. Unlike a four-star hotel, which expects a return on investment within 12 to 14 years, the appreciation in value of a five-star facility grows at a much faster rate. This is very important from a real estate point of view.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It has been an interesting and challenging project, and also very unique. I have been working for the company for the past 20 years, and I have been involved with many openings and property renovation projects. However, the unique thing about this situation was that both happened at the same time. When I joined the hotel in October 2012, the original building was in operation, but plans were being finalized to make the move into the new building of the resort. We needed to wrap-up and transfer hotel operations to the new property during the high season with an approximately 97% occupancy rate. This was the challenge. We could have waited until the summer, or a slower period, but we were so excited about the new facilities, restaurants, and rooms that we wanted our valued guests to experience them at the earliest. The logistics involved in shifting the operations to the new building were complex; however, the ladies and gentlemen were well prepared for this, and we managed a smooth transition thanks to their expertise and finesse. It was indeed a very exciting time for us since this situation is unlikely to ever come about again.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There is no doubt that the market is generally in recovery in Dubai, and we have seen that for the better part of a year now. But, the rate of recovery has varied significantly between and within sectors. In the residential sector in particular, there has been a selective recovery. The prices rent for the better-quality locations and schemes are definitely in recovery, but that is not the case over the whole residential sector, and I think this is a key point that applies across the market. The best are in recovery, but the weaker schemes are not, and it will take much longer for the recovery to hit these properties. We see this divergence of performance in every sector. In retail, for example, if you take the top malls, such as Dubai Mall or Mall of the Emirates, they are doing really well. They have a waiting list of tenants wanting space, high-occupancy rates, and their rents are rising. However, if you look at some of the smaller, older shopping centers, vacancy rates are rising, and they are finding things quite difficult. This is not only seen in Dubai; it happens all over the world.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The proposition is that there will be a fixed loan-to-value ratio of between 40% and 70%, determined by nationality and whether the purchaser is likely to be an end-user. The Central Bank's rationale is to ensure that bank lending doesn't fuel a highly speculatively new cycle in the residential market. There are, however, two problems with the proposal. Firstly, the lending institutions are concerned that the recovery in the residential market will be stifled, and suggest that they have not been consulted on the newly proposed legislation. Secondly, mortgage borrowing for residential sales amounts to less than 30% of the total market, suggesting that the speculative component of the market place is actually fueled by cash buyers who remain unaffected by the legislation. My general view, therefore, is that this proposal is likely to have a limited effect on activity or pricing within the Dubai markets. CBRE has continued to grow over the past three years by offering the business lines that are important components of any property market, regardless of whether values and activity are increasing or declining.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>As real estate professionals, we do not like bubbles. We prefer consistency, and we like to advise clients on what is happening and why it is happening. By its very nature, a bubble isn't particularly easy to read. It is not good for continuous, sustainable growth. What we were hoping for following the 2008-2011 crash was for Dubai to be very much back on the international map, and we want to see some continued, sustainable, steady growth over a period of years, rather than a double-digit increase over a period of 12 months, which naturally leads to a bubble. Every market is cyclical, and an emerging market like the UAE is going to be more cyclical than a more mature market like London or New York. Things can be done to assist. Cyclicality is fine, but you don't want high highs and low lows; that is when you get into problems with the boom-and-bust syndrome. What we need in the UAE is a slightly more sophisticated approach in terms of the investors and the general market, and how they understand real estate, because we are getting back into the zone of people buying with a short-term view.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Silver Heights has been in existence for the past six years. Our core business has been brokerage; however, we have been very successful since diversifying into other areas of business like development, core development, and acquisitions. A year back, we entered a partnership with a high-net-worth individual and formed an investment company called Orion Holdings, which has been investing heavily in the Dubai real estate market. We focus on three core areas, the first being projects that are incomplete. We perform due diligence and buy in bulk, giving developers the liquidity to continue their projects. The second area is where individuals or companies are stuck with banks and unable to pay them. We negotiate with these people and the bank; these are capital-intensive projects. We settle with the banks and then we sell the properties off. Finally, we do all kinds of bulk buying that individuals want to offload onto banks.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are now present in five countries including, the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and India. We are focused on the organic growth of our operations and service offerings. We are building new facilities with a long-term vision set until 2025. For example, we are looking at establishing new hospitals in Qatar and Oman, and we are already constructing three new hospitals in the UAE.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>This is a region with a gap in high-end diagnostic tests… we focused on the genetic area and… we found our niche. Eastern Biotech &amp; Life Sciences introduced a new type of screening in hospitals, which has been very beneficial. We also have advanced genetic tests for cancer, lifestyle diseases, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. It has been a good run so far.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>“Saudi German Hospital has 300 beds… and the second phase of expansion is for six extra specialty hospitals that will be located on the same plot… each with 50 beds. Our long-term plan is to build a mini healthcare city with 600 beds, and a medical tower with clinics. We are creating demand worldwide, and we now have to create supply."</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The role of any company is to generate a profit. However, at Tag Heuer, and more globally within our group, Louis Vuitton Moí«t Hennessy (LVMH), we try to go beyond this and give back to the community. We have been here for many years, having partnered with non-profit organizations including Save the Children. We now have Cameron Diaz and UN Women promoting equality for women around the world. In that respect, it is good for us to be there. Around 40% of our customers are women, meaning that they make up a huge part of our business. At LVMH and Tag Heuer, women hold 60% of our top positions. The executive committee of TAG Heuer is composed of four people; two men and two women. We are also promoting green issues. If you visit our factory in Switzerland, you will observe that the roof is covered in solar power cells, which generate a large part of the energy we use.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In general, consumers have become more brand conscious, and want to know that the stores where they are buying their products or services from are credible. Especially after 2009, this became very important. We actively launch a strong campaign before entering a country, and especially when we open a store, to give as much information as possible about ourselves to the general stakeholders of the country. We want people to understand who we are, why we are planning to enter the market, and what services and products we plan to offer. One thing is clear, and that's the fact that if a company cannot clearly identify or state why someone should buy from them, there will be trouble. If we are just trying to fill a gap and do something because other companies are doing it as well, then it will not work. You have to be very clear on why someone should come to your store.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Today, the region—and Dubai in particular—is no different to any other strategic market in the world. Dubai is a shopping window for the whole region, and as such the product lines, launch timing, availability, and marketing campaigns to back these products are no different to those you would find in New York, Milan, Tokyo, Singapore, or Hong Kong. Dubai is now on the luxury-shopping map as one of the favorite destinations. There is no longer any different perception between the Middle East and the rest of the world. This said, a strong partner in the market like Ahmed Seddiqi &amp; Sons, due to the long-established relationship with certain brands, would tend to create opportunities for specific products to be made available for the Dubai market. As such, the company has been particularly innovative, and the first retailer in the Middle East requesting special limited editions in certain key brands created for this market. But this is because of the relationship we hold with Swiss brands due to the power we represent in the market, the number of prime locations we hold, and the extensive database of clients that we have built for over 60 years.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>At this moment, we consider Dubai able to provide us with the infrastructure needed to host our regional headquarters. In very specialized fields, it is difficult for us to recruit the right talent, which is one of the main reasons why we are in Dubai. We are always evaluating our options, and maybe one day we will have a warehouse in Saudi Arabia to serve that market better. I foresee this happening in the near future. We evaluated the situation, together with our partners, and came to the conclusion that, for the time being, Dubai is the right place. We want to be understood as the partners of the Ministry of Health and the Dubai Health Authority, as when it comes to in-vitro diagnostics, we possess the greatest knowledge. We are happy to share this with people who request it, and actively want to bring our know-how to the market. This aligns very well with the vision of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Canon Middle East moved into its head office at Dubai Internet City (DIC) in 2002. We were the first Japanese imaging company to have set up a regional headquarters at DIC. As the region's largest dedicated ICT cluster in the MENA region, DIC was a natural fit for us, offering us the right platform to build on our closer-to-customers strategy. The headquarters at DIC allows us to build closer relationships with other renowned technology firms and explore alliances and partnerships that will allow our office and consumer products to be integrated with technologies from software, hardware, and networking companies to complement our philosophy of imaging across networks. Our business objective is to create sustained profitable growth by strengthening our core business, building future solutions and services, and improving our capabilities. Canon Middle East and Africa leads the pace of growth throughout the emerging markets, as we continue to report accelerated growth across all business segments, and transition into a new phase of continuous innovation within the imaging industry.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>For me, Dubai is the most dynamic place in the world. If you look at the majority of the international companies located here, you can see that they are managing the region with Dubai as a base. It is clear that there is a multicultural business world in Dubai, so we decided to establish ourselves here. If you consider the whole of the Middle East, our market share is currently at 4.5%. If we focus on the GCC, we have a 1% market share. This is the beginning. If you look at the major countries in the world today, Renault has a market share of more than 10%. We have good products and we know that we can reach at least the 10% level in the Middle East. There is a lot of potential for the brand in this area. Renault is the only worldwide manufacturer that offers a complete range of electric, zero-emission cars. We are waiting for the right timing to bring this offer to our customers here also, in accordance with customer preferences.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We always work very closely with the authorities, and within Dubai Healthcare City (DHCC) we do so with the DHCC team. We are faithful believers in the Dubai University Hospital. It is an ambitious plan, and I believe that now the management has revised its objectives, it is going to take a more staggered approach to the construction of the facility. There is no doubt that Dubai needs a medical school to develop specialists, and we are going to support it. Sometimes, the best place to be in a storm is at the eye, and that is the point where Dubai is considering the situation in the wider region. Dubai is a haven from the strife around it, and everyone wants to come here to work and live. That has been our advantage.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Upgrades to Terminal 3 and the development of Al Maktoum International Airport are being carried out pursuant to the Master Plan 2020, which is designed to meet projected demand of 115 million passengers and 570,000 aircraft movements per annum. The success of Dubai's airlines in providing global connectivity, and the demand set to be created by the World Expo 2020 have prompted the authorities to revise the strategic plans extending to 2045, and to further develop infrastructure to facilitate growth. Through this process, we also contribute to the development of the aviation infrastructure for the benefit of the global aviation industry.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai's Vision 2020 aims to build on the economic and social progress of the city. Winning the World Expo 2020 bid, an integral part of the Vision 2020, will have a tremendous impact on Dubai and the UAE's economy. Businesses of all sizes, from both public and private sectors, will be involved in one form or the other, fuelling growth across all major industries in the country, including logistics. We expect demand for international and domestic shipping to increase as the country prepares to host World Expo 2020. This will be an exciting time for FedEx and the logistics industry in Dubai. The economic impact after the Expo takes place will reinforce Dubai's position as a key economic and trade hub, attracting more SMEs and large corporations to set up their businesses in the city, which, in return, will sustain the need for express shipping and logistic solutions.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I think the World Expo 2020 bid will have an impact on the maritime industry, but more on local logistics in terms of supply. If we get 30 million visitors here in 2020, they will need food and drink and things to buy in the shops. If the Expo is held in Dubai, we'll need a supply chain to support that event in terms of having all the products available, since very little of what people buy and consume in Dubai is manufactured here. It will have an impact, in terms of driving more products toward the Emirate.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>First, I hope Dubai wins the bid to host World Expo 2020, because it will create a lot of interest in Dubai and hopefully reestablish it in the public imagination as a great place to do business. Infrastructure has also developed positively. The building of flyovers and more roads has drastically reduced traffic, and there is now relatively little except for during rush hour to and from Sharjah. This makes our life much easier as a courier company because everything is about speed for us. This means we might be able to deliver a package 10 minutes earlier, which would save a client 10 minutes of production time. Our job is to move things as fast as possible across the world, so small improvements like this make a tremendous difference. Minutes can be very valuable. Many investments have happened and many investments are going to happen, and Expo 2020 would represent a major influx of capital into the city. I hope Dubai wins it.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are working to develop the non-oil sector of both Russia and the UAE. For Russia, it is extremely important to attract investment, innovations, and new technology, which the government understands. Unfortunately, since the end of the Soviet Union, we have been quite far behind. During the Soviet era, technology and science were the best in the world in many areas, and the investment enormous. After the fall, many companies broke apart and chaos took over for a variety of reasons. Over the past few years, the situation has been improving, but it is not easy to catch up with other countries. We are trying to be successful in new high-tech areas, and are now looking for partners. The UAE is in a similar situation; it has the same challenges as Russia does. For example, each country has to rely on cooperation to develop its own nuclear energy, and that is why we want to put our foot in the door in this new energy sector in UAE, supply what we can, and move forward from there. We are considering nuclear projects that could happen 10 or 20 years from now, which will require heavy investment and cooperation.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai became a major trading partner with Germany very quickly, but it is not yet a two-way street. In the beginning, back in the 1990s, Egypt was our most important trading partner. However, very soon, as the Gulf states picked up, so too did Dubai. The UAE continues to be our biggest trading partner in the region. It is very close to Saudi Arabia, which is also picking up. I sometimes find that people do not know where other Gulf states are located, but they know where Dubai is. This is thanks to its resounding reputation. It is an easy place to start and a good location to serve from—and not only to the UAE, but also the whole region, and beyond. I think the reason for the increase, and this will continue, is that Germany's export industry remains strong. It has not lost much power during the general economic crisis. The whole GCC region is still the fifth largest market outside of Europe for German exports. The bulk of German exports go to France and other European countries. Beyond the EU, exports go to the US, Russia, China, and Turkey, then comes the GCC. Within the GCC, the UAE is the largest recipient, and within the UAE the largest is Dubai.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There was a need for an ABC, especially when I launched it at the peak of the financial crisis in 2008. There was actually a need for a private sector club, or a service like the ABC that would bring Arabs and the rest of the world together. Doing business with Arabs is very different from doing business with the Chinese, Japanese, or Latin Americans. There are many cultural differences, and people are often not aware of these differences. Many people misunderstand Arab behavior, and vice versa. For many years, I have seen deals fail because of cultural misunderstandings, so the club started as a way to bridge investments and businesses rotating around the world. We help people understand each other and understand the culture of the Arab world, as well as match-make investment opportunities with investors. The environment here in Dubai makes you think like an individual. Many people who arrive as employees become entrepreneurs and successful business people. We have many successful stories of people around Dubai who have become millionaires just because they came to Dubai and they saw opportunities.</p>]]></sections21>

If not actually the issuer, then at least some of their advisers and service providers are based in Dubai. Yes, Dubai will grow in Islamic finance, but let's not forget that it is already a large player. The knowledge rests here, and Dubai is already a global hub for Islamic, as well as for conventional finance. What we need is incentives for the development of the buy side, for both retail and institutional asset managers. I am certainly not an expert on sharia-related matters, but I don't necessarily believe that some sort of internationally unified sharia supervisory board will be possible, do-able, or even required. Practice already shows how, across jurisdictions, market participants are talking to each other. We see Gulf names present in Malaysia, and we also see Asia-Pacific investors buying products issued by Gulf companies. Again, the focus should be on the investor base and eligibility criteria with regard to what type of investment investors can and want to make, also from a sharia perspective.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Emirates Investment Bank is an independent private and investment-banking boutique. The typical banking model in our region historically relies on retail services for raising deposits and on lending to corporates. Most banks in the UAE hold a commercial banking license that includes retail coverage. We're licensed as an investment bank with limited retail coverage. In effect, we are the only bank in the UAE that is dedicated to servicing a very specific segment of the banking customer base—the high-net-worth (HNW) client segment—by providing them with a highly personalized offering focused on assisting them preserve and grow their wealth. What has happened over the last few years is that there has been a greater recognition of the need to service this segment of the banking customer base. Some of the large commercial banks in our region have opened private banking windows. However, the difference between our bank and these banks is that we are dedicated to the niche HNW sector only. Based in Dubai, Emirates Investment Bank is licensed and regulated as an investment bank by the UAE Central Bank and operates within the full regulatory framework imposed by that institution. The bank is also listed on the Dubai Financial Market (DFM), and is subject to Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority (ESCA) listing rules.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>No one is immune to what is happening in Europe and the world. The GCC, the UAE, and Dubai in particular, have been recovering progressively. They haven't fully recovered yet, but they are indeed recovering. The real estate market is coming back faster than expected, and the price of oil remains high, which helps the budget. The key position of the UAE and Dubai, close to the Indian Subcontinent and on the road to Africa, is definitely supporting the area. It is probably a more sustainable kind of situation. The growth that we will have now in the UAE is less speculative than we had in the 2000s, and more real, sustained growth based on solid economics and the fantastic infrastructure available here. This is a huge strength. It is also not just Dubai, but the whole Middle East that is important. Our office in Dubai allows us to cover the UAE and the GCC region. There is still a lot to be done, but we see improvements in long-term decision making, and not just related to the oil and gas or military sectors, but also in terms of social impact. And this encourages certain European businesses to relocate to Dubai. The infrastructure is here, as is stability, and the central bank is taking the right steps. Many companies have relocated here, and do so successfully.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>HOW IT BEGAN</h4><p>I was in one of the traditional family businesses when I realized that private equity, as an asset class, was something that most of the successful family businesses in this part of the world have been doing.</p><h4>MORE VISIBILITY</h4><p>The weakness of the banking sector has allowed for greater visibility for the space within which private equity operates. The importance and value of the capital provided by private equity firms has become much more significant. No economy benefits from a weak banking system, and therefore recovery in a mature manner is advantageous.</p><h4>WHAT WE LOOK FOR</h4><p>We have stringent criteria as to what kind of companies we'd like to partner with. This revolves around businesses with good leadership, even if there is a secession issue. We look for businesses that have a solid market position, market initiative in what they do, and that aspire to go to the next step.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>IN TOUCH</h4><p>The market right now is healthy. As long as professionals act professionally they should not have a problem. A large percentage of our clients are from Europe and North America. We have the debt management experience to help them out, and we put them in touch with the appropriate partners in the best locations.</p><h4>BIG DEMAND</h4><p>There is huge demand for all our companies and services; we have to be selective. If a portfolio is more than we can handle, then we won't accept it unless we are given enough time for due diligence, and enough time to select the right project. Unless we are certain of being able to help a company, and have the capacity and time to do it, we will not undertake the project. Ultimately, our clients' success is, literally, our success.</p><h4>KNOW-HOW</h4><p>The companies that don't go through us often try to save money, but in the long term this approach creates many more problems and costs. You have to have a local Emirati business partner by law, and so before you establish that partnership you need our help.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OUR PACE</h4><p>The equity and debt capital markets in Dubai have evolved at a very different pace since the global financial crisis. As investors have regained confidence in the credit risk and the growth potential of Dubai, investor appetite for Dubai credit has increased.</p><h4>DEMOGRAPHICS</h4><p>We have always been very keen on investments that are linked to demographics, and this continues to be the case. As the populations in the region increase—this coupled with the increase in their wealth and purchasing power—companies that cater to them will benefit from this embedded growth.</p><h4>IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES</h4><p>We provide our clients access to deals in the region with the potential to generate significant returns. We have proven with our track record that we are able to identify opportunities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Ever since I came to Dubai, prices have dropped drastically, whether it was due to the economic boom or recession. Perhaps the only exception is in the medical business to a certain extent, which has experienced market fluctuations. Automotive rates have, however, dipped by about 50% and property rates have dropped significantly, too. This is very disappointing since as the rates drop, standards will do so too, as underwriters become tempted to approach non-rated entities. In effect, what differentiates a non-reputed insurance company from a reputable one is the underwriter's willingness to opt for fast business in questionable markets, which are way above treaty limits. On the other hand, rated entities such as AA- or AAA-type companies will naturally have rates that are proportionately higher. Many clients tend to be very price conscious at the expense of all other imperative criteria, such as service and quick claims settlement. The real test that they may experience is when they are exposed to claims. Is their claim being handled efficiently and do they receive fair compensation? In essence, rated companies that are backed by first-class reinsurance securities are certainly efficient and pay claims faster than non-rated ones. In reality, there are too many players operating in a relatively small market. There are approximately 62 insurance companies and 300 brokers operating today, and all are battling for a slice of the pie.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>It is often argued that the insurance sector is a rather traditional industry in its approach. When companies offer the same products and services, differentiation can only come from creating new innovative ideas and products, and by offering more enhanced services that will set one apart from the rest. In Alliance's case, we use our company's positive reputation and focus on our many years of solid history, financial strength, and ratings of A- (excellent) from AM BEST. Our long roster of clients has been with us for many years and is a testimony of confidence and trust in our services and financial strength. If what is meant by number one is the topline, we at Alliance tend to focus more on the bottom-line. Achieving high premiums means a radical approach of risk taking and reduction in rates. Our concern is the kind of risk we want to engage in, which is aligned with our overall strategy. We focus on proper risk assessments and proper technical pricing of our products. Yet we see fierce competition nowadays focused on rates, which is unnecessary and harmful for all parties concerned.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>With every venture Standard Life becomes involved in, there is a long process before it reaches the market. There are a number of reasons why we came to Dubai, the first of which is that it is an area of solid economic growth. Indeed, within the Middle East, we view Dubai as a flagship location of robust growth. Secondly, from a financial regulation perspective, we see a strong system. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) is our regulator, and it is very similar to the UK regulator in terms of structure. Beyond that, when we consider the customer base that we target, there are many non-resident expatriates that demand our services. This strong and abundant population is a third reason for our decision to do business here. We welcome any regulation that strengthens the financial environment. The mortgage cap regulation does not affect us directly, and although there has been much dialogue in the market about the new law, we are essentially awaiting further clarification on the regulation before it is fully implemented.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dubai has the reputation of having the world's highest energy, water, and waste footprint per capita. That might have changed in the recent Ecological Footprint report, where Singapore came out as the highest, but we are right up there with them. This is a field in which we could make a big difference if we were doing the right things. Secondly, sustainability is particularly important where there is a paucity of resources. Dubai is fundamentally a desert. There is no ecosystem you can tap into and grow anything; you get your water from the sea and everything has high energy and resource demand. This is an important place to make an impact. Thirdly, sustainability rests squarely on the shoulders of those with a high level of disposable income, because people who don't have money are already fundamentally sustainable; they don't have anything. Because Dubai has a high level of income per capita, it is easy for us to explain and sell the idea of sustainability here. The immediate project is to make the idea of sustainability mainstream and affordable for all. Most of the world is currently poor wanting to become rich; it is not the rich wanting to become poor. We have to make the rich sustainable.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dubai is a business and leisure hub, which also has to compete with other emerging markets to drive business and tourism. To be competitive, it is imperative that costs are kept low. One way to achieve cost optimization is by having sustainable buildings, especially in terms of lowering energy and water consumption and by reusing waste. Hotels and other commercial entities can have a competitive advantage over their peers by adopting sustainable initiatives. Energy prices are increasing worldwide, as in the Gulf region. And when energy prices account for a big chunk of operational cost, it is obviously the first area to be addressed. At the Emirates GBC, we have programs to help buildings—commercial and retail—to reduce their cost base through sustainability initiatives. Emirates GBC members come from a plethora of industrial sectors. We have representatives from the legal, construction, real estate, and supplies sectors, with suppliers comprising over 40% of our membership. The suppliers are very important because they produce the equipment, technology, and materials that are integral in driving sustainable development, and these members form a significant number in terms of knowledge, manpower, and financial strength.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Energy conservation demand around the globe has been on the rise due to the increase in energy tariff rates in many parts of the world. This is also the case in the UAE and other countries in the Middle East. We have been very cautious in our growth considering the current economic recession worldwide. Apart from our base in the UAE, we are expanding our operations in Qatar, Oman, and India. We also have plans to provide our energy management services in Saudi Arabia by 2014. We are gradually ramping up our human resources and will have doubled the existing capacity by end-2013. In addition, the UAE government has already decided to set up a nuclear plant to meet the growing energy demand in the country. However, it will require a huge capital expense and time for the plant to become operational in eight to 10 years. To meet growing energy demand for sustainable growth, the Dubai government is promoting renewable sources of energy. This has resulted in the establishment of new businesses in the renewable energy sector, allowing for an influx of foreign technology and investments. Moreover, a tax-free culture with 100% ownership and the complete repatriation of funds attracts entrepreneurs and makes Dubai a good place to do business.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Dubai really is a gateway not just to the Middle East, but to North Africa as well. We do business in both North Africa and across the Middle East, making Dubai a strategic base, which is strengthened by the presence of Jebel Ali. We bring in cars and spare parts from all across the globe, meaning that we need an excellent logistics center, and our center in Jebel Ali certainly plays that role. Every day, we travel to all the four corners of the globe. There is no better hub to fly in and out of than Dubai. The benefit of being General Motors is the number of brands that we have globally. We selected three brands to bring to the Middle East market. We have Cadillac at the top end, Chevrolet for the mass market, and then the GMC Truck. We probably have the greatest range of vehicles and portfolio of any manufacturer here in the Middle East.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The UAE has experienced strong growth in 2013 and this will be our best year since 2008. The UAE expects to see sales of around 380,000 units in 2013. Mitsubishi, in terms of percentage growth, will be at around 25% for the full year at circa 38,000 sales. The overall market is seeing circa 20% volume growth, although the prestige market is growing even faster. In 2013, we expect to see 45% growth in Bentley sales. Many prestigious brands are experiencing strong growth in this part of the world, meaning manufacturers are looking more and more at how they can do business here. Bentley Emirates has overtaken China now, which is impressive considering the UAE's population of around 9 million people compared to China's of around 1.36 billion people. The UAE enjoys a vibrant business environment that is maturing day by day, and I believe that its progressive companies, which possess strong skill sets, are well placed to grow further not just locally but regionally and globally.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are a number of factors that made 2012 such a successful year for Volkswagen. For example, we launched a number of products tailor-made to the needs and wants of our Middle Eastern customers, including the Passat and Polo sedans. When you look at the market in the Middle East or Dubai, it is very similar to the US market, with the biggest segments being SUVs and sedans. Volkswagen provides German engineering at a price that fits the Middle East. Another factor is our investment in new and existing facilities and our continuing focus on service excellence. We opened new facilities in 2012, and we are currently planning the opening of new state-of-the-art service centers and showrooms in key markets later in 2013. We have two product sectors that we believe have the strongest growth potential: sedans and SUVs. In terms of sedans, we have the Polo sedan, the Jetta, and the Passat. In the SUV category, we have the Tiguan, which is A-class, a smaller SUV, and the Touareg, which is our most successful model in the Middle East. Then, of course, we have the iconic Golf GTI.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We experienced 30% growth in comparison to 2011. This was mainly due to the introduction of new models into the region. We have introduced five new models over the past 12 months: Nissan's new Sunny, Micra, Altima, NV 350 Urvan, and, in 2013, we have introduced the Sentra. Another factor was of course the Tsunami and earthquake in Japan in 2011, which affected production capacity not only for Nissan, but also for all automakers and industries. As a result, we have seen a 30% bounce back in sales compared to the year before. Nissan Patrol sales increased by 38% in the UAE, and were much higher than our overall growth average. After the launch of the current Patrol in 2010, sales are constantly increasing in the second, third, and fourth years. I think it has a lot to do with just how much people here like this car; word of mouth has meant that our sales have been strong year after year. It is the kind of car that if you try it, you love it. We offered plenty of opportunities for people to test drive it, which is crucial for a car like this.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>When DIC first started in 1999, we were very focused on attracting the main players in the industry and global names, because they form the fundamentals of the ICT ecosystem. However, over time, we have been able to focus more on start-ups and entrepreneurs. We have been fortunate to have government support and we have created many opportunities for SMEs and start-ups. These are the companies of the future, and it is extremely important that they are supported and given the opportunity to grow. With this in mind, DIC launched the In5 innovation hub in 2013, which provides infrastructure, support, and a dynamic and engaging working environment to entrepreneurs. We give them mentoring, networking, opportunities, and set-up support to help them from the early stages of idea creation through to the commercial launch of a product or service. DIC has built a great deal of credibility over time. We've built a brand that has been very successful and developed the know-how in requirement with multinationals.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of Media City was to become the regional media hub. In fact, it has grown in scope with a variety of new media developments in the region. Dubai has always been active in a range of sectors, and the media is one of those to have really made a swift and successful mark in the region, and also in North Africa. Most of our business partners were interested in our plans to build small-scale facilities such as services, workshops, and warehouses, as well as studios; they wanted more power, parking, and roads suitable for large trucks. These buildings were mostly designed as office spaces, although we did convert a few of them to studios. As Dubai has grown southward, this area has become one of the most important downtown districts. Media City has indeed become a hub for various companies to showcase their products and services.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There is a growing interest from many regions in establishing business in Dubai. As an example of the strong cooperation between China and Dubai in terms of filmmaking a major Chinese film was shot here in 2012. Parallel to the interest growing in trade, tourism, and other sectors, it is happening in the media as well. The 2013 visit by a Chinese delegation was basically intended to explore how we can work together and what we can offer when it comes to production. With the recently established Dubai Film and TV Commission in 2012, the initial purpose was to support film and TV production in Dubai. There were several hubs in the region, including Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon. Instability in these areas has now directed traffic to Dubai. To accommodate production requirements, we added a new section called location scouting. Companies are coming from the US, Europe, or even parts of Asia to scout for locations before shooting a movie, for example with Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, which was filmed partially in Dubai.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>JUMPS</h4><p>In 2002, prior to deregulation, there were 8.7 million air passengers annually in Turkey; in 2012, we are at almost 60 million. Within 10 years, the number has jumped seven times.</p><h4>COMPETITION</h4><p>One of the major factors in the growth of Turkey's transportation sector has been competition. Turkish Airlines was the only carrier, and competition has helped to stimulate demand because without competition you don't have much advertising or campaigning.</p><h4>REASONS</h4><p>If you are price sensitive there is a good reason to buy our tickets. This is because we are price effective and we offer low prices. If you are product sensitive then it is also wise to buy our tickets, since we are cheaper for the same product.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>RESTRICTIONS</h4><p>If you invest in regional air travel the planes are smaller, so you are limiting yourself from the beginning. The planes can't fly more than two hours, carry 200 passengers, or compete with jet aircraft.</p><h4>OPPORTUNITIES</h4><p>We are communicating with people at light speed, but it is not good enough by itself. People need to travel at an acceptable speed. They should have the opportunity to go anywhere with comfort and speed; this is very important.</p><h4>CODE SHARING</h4><p>Now, we are flying to 19 destinations together and giving them 48 connections. Code sharing is saving Turkish Airlines millions of dollars every month.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SECTORS</h4><p>You can be a low-fare carrier, you can be a legacy carrier, or you can be a regional carrier. The regional airline concept has its own unique challenges.</p><h4>MEETING NEEDS</h4><p>If you start flying from Istanbul to Ankara from the Golden Horn, you will meet the needs of business travelers. We will give them the opportunity to save time. It is all about the expectations of the clients. Our service offers convenience and connects sites that have not been connected.</p><h4>POSSIBILITIES</h4><p>We have recently completed a study on 80 possible untapped destinations in Turkey, which no other carrier flies to. Some of them are float operations on water, and some of them are regular land operations.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NEW LINES</h4><p>The Istanbul-Beirut route is very important, as it is a crucial link between Lebanon and Turkey. Turkish and Lebanese people share many similarities, and there is a substantial potential of trade and tourism between the two countries.</p><h4>ATTRACTIONS</h4><p>Tourism has boomed between the two countries. We regularly organize familiarization trips and invite travel agents and tour operators. Beirut has always been an attractive destination. It is famous for its resorts, nightlife, casinos, and shopping.</p><h4>E-TICKETING</h4><p>Although e-ticketing is the future and has made business travel more efficient, we still believe that travel agents are important. We always have to adapt to whatever developments come about.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TARGETS</h4><p>Our ultimate target is to bring convenience to the Turkish consumer by offering everything a customer needs or wants online. This is a unique model for Turkey, and there are only five or six other e-commerce platforms like ours, such as Amazon or eBay, for example.</p><h4>TRUST</h4><p>We've brought a senseof trust to internet shopping thanks to our reputation and the confidence we inspire in consumers. The business model has proven solid, and today we sell 381,000 products per day. We ship 46,000 units a day from our warehouses, 64% of which are outside of Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir.</p><h4>POTENTIAL<br></h4><p>There are about 37 million connected people in Turkey, with about 9 million people who regularly shop online. If we don't include online banking, airlines, travel, food, and Yemeksepeti.com, we're still talking about around 4 million people who shop online at e-commerce sites.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>CUSTOMERS</h4><p>We have 710 employees and we sell over 800,000 products via 500 campaigns a month. We have a monthly traffic of 22 million hits, which is more than double of any mall's unique visitors in Turkey.</p><h4>BRANDED</h4><p>There are over 50 fashion companies of different formats. Every time we participate in market research, Markafoni is recognized as the leading brand—not just in fashion, but also in local e-commerce.</p><h4>CASH FLOWS</h4><p>The e-commerce sector in Turkey is registering upward of TL15 billion in revenue, all formats included—marketplaces, flash sales, and retailers. Out of that, TL6 billion is business-to-consumer sales.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BETS</h4><p>We are now the largest, best, and most detailed football database on the internet. Users come to our website before placing bets in order to check all of the statistics. Then, they place their bets on legal websites before coming back to us to check the results.</p><h4>DATABASES</h4><p>At our company, we have about 35 editors, moderators, and operators and about 10,000 Turkish volunteers who attend matches. Every week, we publish the results of about 1,000 matches, 100 of which take place in Turkey.</p><h4>SPEED</h4><p>We also receive live data from a company in Switzerland about games happening all around the world. If you watch the game on TV, you learn the results at least 10 seconds later than we do, because the image has to go through the satellite. Those 10 seconds are very important, and we are much faster.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The wine industry began to develop in the 1980s as a result of economic reforms put in place by Prime Minister Turgut Özal, who significantly liberalized the economy. The biggest factor in that growth was the increase of tourism at the time. As tourists started to visit Turkey on holiday, they wanted to drink wine, which solidly promoted the growth of the industry. Until the 1990s, wineries were investing in increasing their capacity to meet growing demand. However, toward the end of the 1990s, more wineries started to move into investing in quality as production grew to meet demand. Wineries began to invest in their own vineyards because quality became more important. Because grapes are native to this region, we have over 800 varieties, around 300 of which are suitable for winemaking. This compares to just two or three in many New World wine countries. Turkey has now reached a very high-quality level of wine production. In 2011 and 2012, Turkey received over 500 medals at international wine challenges. However, our wine export totals are still low. Total wine production in Turkey is estimated at between 75 million and 100 million liters. Of that production, only around 3 million liters is exported, worth around $8 million. However, I do believe that exports will be the main driver of growth for Turkish wine production over the medium term.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Kalecik karası is a grape that comes from Kalecik, where our vineyard is located. The importance of this region and the particular grape lies in the soil and the microclimate of the area. It is considered one of the most ideal regions for producing wine; identical to that of other premium world-class wine-growing terrains. The most important feature of the Kalecik region is the vicinity of the surrounding mountains of the vineyards. It is about 700 meters above sea level, therefore the temperature difference between day and night is considerable. This difference is an important factor with regard to the quality of the grapes. With the Kalecik karası grape, besides our young and reserved wine, we have also managed to produce the first and only Turkish sparkling wine using the classical method. This grape has a huge potential. We have focused on Turkish grapes, and we want to become an international brand and introduce wine drinkers around the world to Turkish grapes. In spite of wine's long history in Anatolia, neither Turkish grapes nor the wines are known in today's world. Only in the 1990s Turkish wine rapidly expanded following the world market, and our mission is to introduce and build awareness for these indigenous grapes. Most people are eager to taste something different as they are tired of the same kind of wine, and this is to our advantage.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Turkey's low-end wines are looking for new markets. The solution may be to enter the UK market, which is currently having problems with suppliers. The low-end wine suppliers of yesterday, such as Australia and New Zealand, are pulling back from the UK market. They are selling to more profitable markets such as the US, Japan, and China. These markets are much more profitable for low-end wine sellers. Turkey may enter external markets at this lower level, especially in the UK, Germany, and maybe even the US market. Turkish wine will play the role previously played by Australian wine producers. Competition will come from Eastern European countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, which have also renovated their wine industries. Sooner or later, people will realize Chamlija is a seriously good-quality wine, and the prejudice will diminish. Blind tastings reflect that the quality of this wine can compete favorably with any of the world's top wines. However, the rest of the Turkish market will be slow to achieve the standards of Chamlija. When you aim for the very top, it is a long journey. In Turkey, investors and producers are not aiming for the top because of the amount of time and the many sacrifices it takes. Turkey's wine production, in most cases, does not have the capacity to wait 10 years to build an exceptional reputation.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>PARTNERS</h4><p>We would like to keep the production in Turkey, but use Spain for marketing. It makes more sense in the long term for the company to partner with a European firm because we would like to be in the heart of Europe.</p><h4>CHALLENGES</h4><p>Gas equates to 40% of our production costs. However, I can't explain to foreign customers that natural gas prices in Turkey are increasing because it's not like that in other countries.</p><h4>EXPANSION</h4><p>We recently opened a showroom in Benghazi, Libya. Moving forward we want to open another five showrooms across Libya by the end of 2013. Right now we are focusing on Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, but we will also look to other areas.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PRODUCTION</h4><p>Nuh Çimento started production in 1969 with an installed capacity of 500,000 tons of cement a year. Today, the capacity is 4.4 million tons of clinker and 6 million tons of cement.</p><h4>EXPORTS</h4><p>We are one of the major exporters of Turkey with more than 1 million tons a year of exports, which is approximately 20% of our business. It is about $60 million a year.</p><h4>NATIONAL</h4><p>In 2012 Turkey's cement capacity was the fifth largest in the world. Two or three years ago, we came in fourth for global capacity. The total capacity is roughly 100 million tons of cement production a year.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>HISTORY</h4><p>BASF has a 30-year history in Turkey, and it is one of the biggest construction chemical companies with a large range of products in its portfolio. There are many local players in Turkey, but most of them are busy with only certain construction chemicals.</p><h4>IMPORTANCE</h4><p>Turkey has a specific position in this region, because after the financial crisis it did not slow down. If you look at GDP growth rates and the construction industry growth rate, especially from 2008 until today, you see a growing economy.</p><h4>DRIVERS</h4><p>You have to be innovative, and naturally this affects your success. If you want to be in a position where you manage the market or where you drive the market, you have to be innovative.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One of Turkey's many advantages is its geography. Turkey sits in the middle of the world. It has a number of cultural ties with the Middle East and with the CIS region. The economic and social developments over the last decade have made it a very attractive place to invest. Turkish Airlines is also important; you can fly to almost any regional destination from Istanbul with a maximum flight of four hours. The regulations have changed a lot over the past 10 years. The Ministry of Health has implemented many EU standards regarding products in Turkey, and this has created an advantage for the Turkish pharmaceutical industry. If you develop good products, you have a competitive advantage in the markets you want to enter. Competition in the generic sector is very tough, especially with India, China, and Eastern Europe competing. There are strong players in the Middle East as well. Turkish manufacturers have an excellent technological base with a huge production capacity. The Turkish industry has a capacity over 2 billion packs annually, with the domestic market consuming approximately 1.4 billion-1.5 billion packs. Also, the manpower in Turkey, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, is highly qualified. It gives the country a competitive edge for products you can differentiate, not only the generic products, but the value-added type of generic products as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Roche is supporting the government's 2023 vision, because we think that there is an opportunity for Turkey in terms of R&amp;D investment. R&amp;D expenditure in the pharmaceutical industry globally is more than $100 billion annually, of which $9.36 billion is invested by Roche. However, when you look at Turkey, R&amp;D expenditure in pharmaceutical investments is only about $33.7 million (TL60 million), which is significantly lower than the global figures. When we consider the geographical advantage of Turkey, the scientists with expertise who can conduct these kinds of trials, and the economic and demographic indicators, which are promising, I am sure that the gap between what can be done and what is being done today will be closed. The Roche Global R&amp;D group assigned the MENA “hub“ leadership to Turkey, which has been exhibiting ever-increasing potential in recent years and has been developing rapidly in this field. This “hub“ structure led by Turkey includes the countries that are developing in the field of clinical research, such as Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Iran, Pakistan, and Turkey.  Our purpose is to conduct a major portion of the pharmaceutical development activities currently conducted by Roche's R&amp;D organization in Turkey, and to provide high-quality data in a timely and cost-efficient manner.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The Turkish pharmaceutical industry is going through a process of rapid transformation. Bilim Pharmaceuticals adapts itself to this process through R&amp;D activities. Currently, super generic drugs and value-added products are developed at our R&amp;D center. Moreover, another group that has focused on exports steers our R&amp;D activities, aiming at international markets. The average life expectancy is increasing and the number of older people is growing. This is leading to an increase in the prevalence of chronic disorders. For this purpose, we have structured our R&amp;D center so it serves such areas as the central nervous system, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and cardiology, while directing our efforts to develop new products in these areas. Biotechnological products have begun to be widely used in our country, as in the rest of the world. This new trend encourages companies to step up their R&amp;D activities in order to develop bio-similar products. We plan to enter this area quickly by carrying out joint R&amp;D activities with products that offer bio-similar products. The only way to exist both in the domestic and international markets is to have an advanced and fast-working R&amp;D center. For this reason, we aim to hire employees with a Master's degree or a doctorate. Moreover, the training we provide to all of our employees at our R&amp;D centers are very important to us. We have already focused on this issue. Generally, there is a lack of R&amp;D personnel in Turkey.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>At first, Åžişecam just produced glassware, but later it began to produce flat glass and glass containers. We also produce soda ash and chromium. Our export initiative in 2000 enabled us to become a major worldwide exporter with an annual turnover of $3 billion, producing goods in 10 countries and exporting to a total of 150 countries. We are among the top-10 glass producers in the world. We are the third largest glassware producer in the world, and the second largest in Europe. We have certain parts of our business based abroad; about 60% of our production is done in Turkey. Russia, however, has advantages for production, even though there are other costly factors there too. Production is expensive in Bulgaria, which is also a natural gas importer. In Turkey, energy and labor costs are in general higher than in the other countries we operate in. By contrast, in Russia the labor turnover is very high. Turkey is also good in terms of attracting and fostering investments. However, it is important to diversify production locations for logistical reasons.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>When we started over 30 years ago as a plastic agricultural machine parts producer, Turkey was transforming. During the period of the late Turgut Özal, the country began exporting and so we also started to export as well. The country was evolving and growing and there was a need for disposable products. For example, when the first McDonalds came to Istanbul, it was importing everything from the US, and so we saw an opportunity and I wanted to move in that direction. What we did differently to our competitors was expand into exports. Most companies in our sector were not exporting because it didn't seem to make sense. There is not a lot of labor involved and the raw materials come from outside the country, so exporting did not seem feasible. In the end, this was an advantage for us. While our domestic competitors fought to remain competitive at home, we were growing in our export markets. At that time, exports accounted for 85% of our revenues. Now, the balance between exports and domestic sales is more like 50-50.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The European market was a compelling one in which to realize this vision, a function of its predilection toward high-quality services and innovative content providers. At the time, the prevalent venture capital standard in Silicon Valley centered upon locating the management team close to the customer base, but outsourcing R&amp;D and operations to China, India, and the like. Our core principle was to reject this geographical disjoint, refocus the model, and centralize the core business in Turkey with our customer base next door in Europe. In those days, Turkey was a low-cost country. We want to be a leading brand in the home networking arena across Europe. Whether or not we can take worldwide leadership in certain sectors remains yet to be seen, and understandably that road will be a bit tougher. At least for now within the European home networking segment we have already made notable steps toward becoming a well-regarded, sought-after partner with a reputation for technological excellence. Of this we could not be more proud.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Originally, I was a medical doctor, working at Cerrahpaşa Medical School from 1975 to 1989. In 1989, I entered the private sector as a partner and the director of the nuclear medicine department of Turkey's first private hospital that provided top-notch medical care at international standards, International Hospital Istanbul. Back then, nuclear medicine wasn't a widespread and well-known branch of medicine, but through the efforts of our company, MNT Healthcare, over the years we made it more so, and now we have over 50 nuclear medicine centers in Turkey and internationally. We also established radiotherapy and radiology departments in recent years. We focus mainly on Eastern Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, and the post-Soviet states. With the acquisition of a well-known US medical brand, Capintec, we are also enthusiastic about entering the US market.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is one of the top countries to invest in. Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea, and Turkey are now known as MIST countries, and we have continued to expand our investments here. We recently made a public statement that we will invest $900 million in Turkey over the next three years. This is proof of how important Turkey is to us. The region that Turkey is a part of, the Middle East, is also strategically very important for GE's growth. The last few years have also allowed us to make more revenue outside of the US than inside the US. This is due to the growth dynamics of the world. Within this context, Turkey is, with its stability, economic growth, strategic geographic position, and growth potential in the region, a crucial country for GE and I am happy to be at the helm of my company in my own country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is a very important country for global companies, including Citi. As a result of its geostrategic position, Turkey is a natural bridge between East and West. This is becoming even more important going forward. Being in Turkey grants access to 56 countries within a four-hour flight. It is a major trade and investment opportunity in the region. Turkey is a rising star due to its stable political environment, economy, and especially the banking industry, which is very strong. Turkey excels in many metrics. Its consumer loans-to-GDP ratio is positive, as is its young population. This all points to a bright future. Turkey opens up many opportunities for Citi elsewhere in the world as it is becoming a hub for many multinationals, including finance companies. It is also positive that talent is staying in Turkey instead of heading abroad for work.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The bank was established in 1989 and changed hands a few times before being acquired by Burgan Bank in 2012. The attraction to Turkey is that Burgan Bank is coming from a very rich and sound economy, but an economy with limitations on the growth perspective. Turkey opens the door to growth opportunities. GDP growth over a long period is high thanks to Turkey's vibrant local and domestic potential, as well as its potential to attract foreign demand; however, our foreign destination did change, switching from Europe to the MENA region. Burgan thought it was a country that promised large potential growth, and it has a banking industry that over the last global banking crisis showed a very robust performance. It did not deteriorate at all in its financial ratios, or its ability to support the economy as needed elsewhere, and therefore Burgan Bank found Turkey an attractive market and entered.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Vestas has been the leading wind energy company since the beginning of the 1980s, when we first entered the Turkish market. Our expansion began in the early 2000s, when the wind industry began growing globally. As a company solely committed to wind energy, we pursued a role as a market maker, creating awareness through customers and other stakeholders, by always pursuing its vision to bring wind on par with oil and gas. That also coincided with the rise of interest in renewable energy in Turkey as a way to reduce energy imports. In 2006 the market began to expand, and two years later we reinforced our commitment to the country's energy agenda and our presence in the market by opening our local office.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is a great example of a country that is emerging. Sometimes that term is used loosely, but it has been a phenomenal example of the desire to get better. They have a clear vision as a country from the leadership right down to the people in the streets. They want to get better and they are working hard, consistently. They have survived a number of challenges in the past and have decided to move forward fast and in an ambitious way. That is a great example for so many countries; not just in our region, but all over the world.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are focusing on mid- and lower-mid-market segments of the economy because Turkey has a very strong private sector constituted of family-owned, mid-sized companies. These companies have experienced significant growth over the last 10 years, and many of them are running into two issues. One is that they have grown their company to reach certain revenue levels, and to grow more they will need to look nationally or internationally. To go to the next level, these businesses need to evolve from entrepreneur-run operations into institutionalized businesses. At that point, they will need a good partner they can rely on. During the expansion phase, institutionalization is the first issue. The second issue is the lack of capital. In Turkey, families invest everything they have into their business, with no long-term financing available. They are not ready to go public at that size, and it is not healthy for them to do so. They need good, long-term capital to be able to achieve their full potential of growth.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The 2008 crisis changed my outlook on the world. When the crisis hit, I questioned what was wrong, because I was doing everything the right way according to how I was taught. I went back and studied the people who warned about a potential crisis. What I realized was that they were mostly following the Austrian school of economics, and that was an eye opener. The US-centric education, which I've gone through in Turkey and abroad, is mostly based on the Keynesian school of economics and somewhat on the Chicago school of economics. These schools advocate the government stepping in when things go wrong. I believe that central interventions are actually delaying the problems we are facing and accumulating them, so that when they erupt they may be less frequent, but much larger, like the 2008 crisis. There are different reasons for this. When people act with their own money, if they fail, then another small, competitive company survives and does better.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ak Asset Management was established in 2000. In the early years, it was all mutual funds, with the dominance of money market funds. In the early 2000s, the short-term interest rates were very high, making fixed income funds, especially money market funds, an attractive investment alternative for  retail investors. As the private pension system was established in 2003, we have started managing pension funds as well, and with the solid growth until now, pension funds have become an important portion of our assets under management (AUM); currently, we are the market leader in managing pension funds with a 24% market share. We stepped into discretionary portfolio management in 2007, and have demonstrated huge success in gaining market leadership in less than five years with a 28% market share. In October 2012, Ak Asset Management was the second largest asset manager in Turkey with total AUM of approximately $5.2 billion.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>On the private equity side, it is always dependent on the investment rate of return (IRR) because our job is to provide an attractive return to our investors. Our approach is not sector related. If the IRR is attractive and the prospects are good then we may invest. On the public equities side, we are driven by benchmarks and the outperformance thereof. We manage according to our philosophy on public equity, which is to never invest in companies if we don't know the management or the company. We make regular visits to companies and actively engage via brokers to maintain contact through one-on-one meetings with the management of our investments. Ashmore is dedicated to obtaining and maintaining knowledge of the companies we invest in. On the fixed income side, we work very closely with our global fixed income fund managers in order to understand macro events. Our London-based fund managers are also large ticket investors in Turkey, which helps the local Ashmore business with relationships at the Treasury and the Central Bank.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Every fossil fuel gives off environmentally damaging emissions, and this of course also includes coal. We in Turkey are very sensitive to environmental issues, especially considering our efforts to join the EU. We have R&amp;D projects to not only increase efficiency in production, but also to produce a cleaner output. We work with universities, the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), and other companies to this purpose, and we are interested in applying the technologies of countries like Australia and Germany. We signed an agreement with ThyssenKrupp from Germany. In the Soma basin, there will be 6 million tons of coal produced per year, as well as 1.5 billion cubic meters of substitute natural gas (SNG), which will be produced from that coal. That will account for one-ninth of all household consumption of coal and gas in Turkey. In 2013, we plan on creating a joint venture with ThyssenKrupp. We've also set up a microbiological laboratory with a US company from Kentucky called Arctech, where we will produce microbiological products. In MicGas Coal BioTech Project, there are microorganisms that eat the coal to produce methane gases and humic acid that can be used to clean polluted water. It can also be used for agriculture, as well as to degrade heavy metals. This is a small pilot facility for now, but we will eventually expand it for commercial purposes.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Coal is the next big trend in the energy sector. We cannot continue to build gas-fired plants as we do today. Secondly, we now have the technology to create clean coal power generation. With a new incentive system, I believe we'll see a boom, as long as investors and the public can find common ground on environmental issues. The problem with Turkish coal is that it's 30% sulfur and 30% ash, and only 15% is convertible into energy. That means we need the technology to be able to extract this energy as efficiently and cleanly as possible, and Alstom has that capacity. We can do complete turnkey contracts with the boilers, steam turbines, generators, automation systems, and of course the most crucial issue, which is the environmental control systems. Therefore, we see ourselves as unique in that respect. Turkey has more than 10 GW of lignite available over the next five to six years, if it can be developed with the new system. Coal is very important for helping Turkey achieve energy independence, as is diversifying Turkey's energy sources, and focusing more attention on renewable and nuclear energy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It is important to have a balanced energy portfolio. Renewables are a part of that. However, that will not meet all of our energy needs today or in the future. Additionally, it is important to understand the regional concentration of renewable resources. For example, wind energy is predominant in the Aegean region; however, that is not necessarily the right resource for Eastern Turkey, where wind resources are not as prevalent. As for lignite, often referred to as “dirty coal,“ why not promote the development of clean coal technology for low carbon systems? Again, we have a great need in this country that is not expected to decrease in the years to come; but increase. We need to promote all energy resources, such as renewables where they are effective, and lignite. Lignite is an important source to meet some of Turkey's energy needs. If we were able to decrease Turkey's need on petroleum imports by 10%-15%, that would be a significant value to the national economy. Shale gas could also come into play, but we have to prove it and prove that it is an economically viable resource.</p>]]></sections21>

In Turkey, many of the local solar module suppliers are small-scale companies that have entered the sector very recently. If you are going to invest millions of dollars, you want to work with a larger solar module supplier.</p><h4>EXPORT ORIENTATED</h4><p>Our production is 100% export oriented. Therefore, we have decided to locate our production facilities in the Istanbul Free Trade Zone because it has better trade links with the region. Being located there gives us a better access to the European market, which right now is bigger than the Turkish market.</p><h4>AFTER CHINA</h4><p>Turkey may be the second-largest solar module exporter to Europe after China. Many of the other large Chinese solar manufacturers are now planning to move some of their production facilities to Turkey to get better access to the EU market. Europe is the largest market for solar technology in the world.</p>]]></sections01>

It is possible that a number of international companies will seek acquisitions and purchase facilities that are up and running, such as hydropower plants.</p><h4>HUGE WAVES</h4><p>Interest has grown a great deal and we are seeing increased demand from Korea, Japan, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Companies from these countries are flooding into Turkey. In addition, countries and companies in the Middle East are shifting their focus to Turkey in huge waves.</p><h4>ENGINES OF THE ECONOMY</h4><p>I see Turkish industry as very, very strong. Foreigners and especially Europeans continue to ask, “What is Turkey's secret?“ The secret of our economy is the SMEs in Anatolia; these are the small, but numerous, engines of our economy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>ON TRACK</h4><p>Turkey is the regional base for RES's operations. Although it was not the case in 2012, the Turkish economy now has a bigger growth rate than its neighbors over the past few years. I think we are back on the right track now and the demand for energy is increasing rapidly again.</p><h4>ON TARGET?</h4><p>If you consider that we have yearly installed capacity of approximately 500 MW over the last three years in wind energy, we have to install a minimum of 2,000 MW per year to reach our targets by 2023.</p><h4>FOREIGN NEED</h4><p>Turkey needs foreign investors, especially from Europe. Foreign investors are also a source of know-how and an opportunity to create jobs. RES Anatolia is a Turkish company, but we get a lot of support from our headquarters during our projects. We employ Turkish engineers and often utilize our company's network to send our staff to receive training in our other offices.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>TARGETS</h4><p>Polat Energy was established in 2000 and has grown to become a major player in the renewable energy market. Polat Energy's key targets are to invest in renewable energy resources, reduce carbon emissions, and create a balanced energy mix for sustainable development.</p><h4>CAPACITIES</h4><p>Turkey has huge potential for renewable energies. In terms of wind potential, Turkey exceeds many of European countries with its 48 GW (38 GW onshore and 10 GW offshore) of wind potential. In 2000, the installed wind energy capacity of Turkey was 18.9 MW and it reached 2,367 MW as of March 2013.</p><h4>WHAT TO DO</h4><p>In order to increase and promote wind energy investments in Turkey, prices must be realistic and applicable. The long permission process is also another obstacle to wind energy investments. Because of the bureaucratic procedures, getting permission from institutions can be a complex and time-consuming process.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Bayegan was established as a family-owned business by our grandfathers in the 1940s, making it one of the oldest petrochemicals companies in Turkey. My husband is the third generation and the sole owner of the company. The founders were in the paraffin business, as electricity wasn't widespread at the time. One of our grandfathers was on the chemical side while the other was on the polymer side. They got into the petrochemical sector from that point. Back then, the company was only present in the Turkish market and nowhere else. However, when the third generation took over, the company began to open up. We broadened our focus to become a regional distributor, but we quickly realized that we needed to be in China and India, because 40% of the world's population lives there. Thus, we established our China and India offices, and eventually expanded to 23 offices globally. Most of them are not very big—some are just five people—but we think it is important to have a presence, meet people, and see what is happening in all of our markets. This move established Bayegan as the first international Turkish petrochemicals trading company, and we now work along the entire production chain. This puts us at an advantage. Since we operate on all levels of the value chain, we can see how changes in the prices of raw materials can affect the prices of finished products.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Dow combines the power of science and technology to passionately innovate what is essential to human progress. The company connects chemistry and innovation with the principles of sustainability to help address many of the world's most challenging problems, such as the need for clean water and renewable energy generation, as well as increasing agricultural productivity. Dow's diversified industry-leading portfolio of specialty chemicals, advanced materials, agro-sciences, and plastics businesses delivers a broad range of technology-based products and solutions to customers in approximately 160 countries in high-growth sectors such as electronics, water, energy, coatings, and agriculture. In 2012, Dow had annual sales of approximately $57 billion and employed approximately 54,000 people worldwide. The company manufactures more than 5,000 products at 188 sites in 36 countries. The chemical industry has been active in Turkey for decades. As an energy corridor, Turkey acts as a gateway to landlocked Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries in need of chemical production capacity that links their feedstock to downstream technology and favorable logistics. Today, this $21 billion industry directly employs more than 80,000 skilled professionals. Currently, Dow has one of the largest R&amp;D investments in the global chemical industry—number two globally and number one among American companies.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our innovation center is a good role model for the industry. We have received good feedback from our customers and the government, as we build up this investment in innovation and further the development of the economy by having innovation on the ground. I believe that the growth of the Turkish economy will come from innovation; that is why making these investments is also encouraging other multinationals to consider making a more positive impact on the country. We also have customers working to understand the concept and the platform that we are using for innovation in Turkey and how they can replicate the same setup for their own businesses. I believe that it is the right time and the right investment. DuPont spends more than $2 billion on R&amp;D annually, and we are spending this money mainly on three major areas: food, energy, and protection. Having these innovation centers will allow us to reach over 10,000 scientists around the globe, as well as 150 R&amp;D centers, through the technology that we have available here. This will allow us to take advantage of DuPont's size to meet the challenges of the market or different markets and to communicate with our scientists and R&amp;D centers the needs of the market and collaborate on different countries, rather just focusing on the challenges that Turkey faces.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>This is the first brand that combines cashmere and silk. There were cashmere and silk garments on offer before, but they came together in a meaningful way for the first time here. This was an innovation. We have been given many awards nationally, and I am proud that this is a true success story. The concept has always been touch. We encourage people to touch the cashmere, even if they're not going to buy. People are welcome to touch and have a try. Turkey has become a case study in many books on branding, and we would be very happy if young entrepreneurs take us as an example to make something out of nothing. Turkey doesn't have a large source of raw materials, except for historical and touristic sights. The country has a young population and is a hot product. Everyone in Turkey wants the country to be successful. The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well here and I believe in it strongly. There is nothing missing here. Once you have an education, you can start a business and do anything. I believe the entrepreneurial spirit increases social welfare, as having numerous companies and brands is better than having just a few massive companies. SMEs are highly significant, and that is why I make speeches at conferences and universities in order to motivate young people to do something for themselves and for the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have a very large collection. For each season we have a selection of goods from the current collection according to the clothing culture of the market. We find suitable styles and products and send them to other countries. Sometimes, we can build collections that are suitable to the attributes of a particular country, but this is very rare. To give you an example, the clothing style for a season may not be the same in Antalya and Istanbul because the climate is different. We send a suitable collection to Antalya, which we choose from the collection we have. We use the same system in different countries. Turkey has a very critical place in terms of its geographical location. It has something in common with the EU, the US, and other countries; there is nothing political in terms of the economy. Also, it has the largest population in Europe after Germany and most of the population is below 25 years old. Its economy is growing much faster than European countries and there are many new investment areas.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>I have attended every exhibition and watched and helped the designers. Even though I have no education in fashion, I have always had an aesthetic taste in clothing. I use those talents to direct the designers according to my taste. I have always been five or 10 steps ahead of the competition. We are also creative with our fabrics. We do not produce our own fabric, but we work together with the factories to produce special materials. We try to personalize our materials, especially the colors and fabrics. We do not sell to third parties. We source our materials from Turkey, France, and Italy, and get the silk from China, as we find it to have the best price and quality. We are trying to produce the same kind of fabric in Turkey that they do in France and Italy. Even though we do not have the same brand quality, we are trying to develop it here and make it even better. Everybody is trying to differentiate themselves, and so are we—especially with our fabrics and styles. In the textile industry in Turkey, you always need to renew yourself with new collections and styles. Every month you start from zero. That is why if you don't have the right people at the top to direct the company, it will not be successful. I believe that our company will help Turkey grow as much as the government wants to and through international expansion we will grow with the Turkish economy in the future.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I applaud what the government is doing with social security and to make individuals more accountable for planning for their future. They are first addressing changes to private pensions. The changes that have been made with the new pension laws for 2013 are a huge step forward in getting people to understand that pensions are not about short-term savings, but long-term planning and accountability. From an opportunity standpoint, life and pension companies have the ability to do more than just sell a pension contract; they are able to acquire a customer and provide not only security, but education and planning for the future. The focus is making sure customers are aware of the risks that can take place between now and retirement. However, insurers should not stop there. They also have to be prepared for what happens after retirement. Developing and offering products such as fixed and variable income plans will become more important in planning for our customers' post-retirement stage. This is the opportunity for life and pension companies today. The ones who win will be those who focus on the customer's long term opportunity and provide the necessary advice and products to ensure a secure future for their existing and new customers. I have no doubt that Finans Emeklilik will be one of the biggest winners.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The market is fairly disciplined right now. The main effect of the legislation is going to be more discipline. In 2010, the expense ratio increased to 10% of GDP. In 2001, the savings ratio was 20%, and it now has dropped to 10%. That means people are spending more and more, and what we want is contradictory to what the banks want in a sense. The banks want people to use their credit cards, while we want people to use their credit cards to also pay their pensions and savings. I believe we will be in a much better position in the next three or four years. Due to this new legislation, more people will participate in the system. Previously, only certain people were able to participate because of the tax advantage. Now, people who were not able to afford it will be able to, and this will create growth in our sector. Mid- and high-income groups will also participate because of the support of the government. Like other developing countries, we have a more than 20% growth rate, whereas Europe has a 5% growth rate.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>With the new law that includes a 25% state contribution to pension accounts, we expect serious and inevitable growth. We should consider private pensions from a long-term perspective of at least 10 years, because it is only then that you start seeing a real growth effect. Nevertheless, we already saw a two fold increase in 1Q2013 compared to the same period in 2012. Growth will continue, because Turkey's population is aging in line with the world population. The social security system is becoming unsustainable, with two working people now supporting one pensioner, which is why private pensions will become more and more prominent. Whereas in the past only those on payroll who earned taxable income could apply for pensions, now everybody can benefit from private pensions with a 25% state contribution. We are expecting major growth in the private pension sector.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS</h4><p>The country has been very successful in the sectors that require more industrial labor. However, for the growth of the economy, we need to refocus on higher value-added sectors. In this regard, there have been major developments in the machinery sector in Turkey.</p><h4>SIGNIFICANT IMPACT</h4><p>We are the leader in working with the government to develop Turkey's overall machinery strategy. Comparing our work to our budget, our program has been very effective because we made a significant impact with a relatively small amount of funding.</p><h4>MITIGATING PROBLEMS</h4><p>If developing countries are not capable of producing their own machines, their ability to compete at an international level is lowered. Turkey has a current account deficit problem, and the ability to produce our own machinery can help mitigate that.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS</h4><p>The company started manufacturing basic boilers, steel boilers, and water boosters. In only 10 years, Baymak had become a huge success. In mid-2005, Baymak introduced the condensing boiler to the market.</p><h4>RENEWABLES</h4><p>We know the energy needs of the country, and that is why we believe in renewables. Two years ago, Baymak decided to produce photovoltaic products as a complementary product for the Baymak range . For this reason, Baymak's first focus is on thermal energy, especially for export.</p><h4>CHANGING TIMES<br></h4><p>In our industry, all products work with natural gas, which we import. If there is a change in the energy structure, these companies would adapt their products to the new era and we would have products that are more solar oriented. I believe that Baymak can adapt to the new era and there will be no risk for the company.</p>]]></sections11>

We established our metal foundry in 2009, which has been recognized as the cleanest foundry in the world.</p><h4>IMPORTANT FOR TURKEY</h4><p>Exports are very important, not only for Hema Endüstri, but also for Turkey. Currently, exports account for 60% of our business, and we export to 36 countries around the world.</p><h4>BIG GOALS</h4><p>Our target is to have a turnover of ‚¬2 billion by 2023 and be among Turkey's top-20 companies. We will achieve this goal by investing 18% of our turnover every year, which will result in a 30% increase in our employment. We also plan to expand our R&amp;D operations by investing 7% of our turnover in R&amp;D each year.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In Mexico, we are mirroring our global strategy, which has led us to change our business and culture to get closer to patients, grow, and improve our performance. We are structured into four divisions, one of which is innovation, or patented products. GSK Mexico is considered an R&amp;D company, meaning that innovation is an important part of our operations. The launch of new products is primary to our continuing position in the innovative brands area. Over 2012, we launched three new products. Two of them were oncological products; one for renal cancer and another for thrombocytopenia. GSK Mexico has also released a new combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. In 2013, we are planning at least three new innovative launches. Many of these products are very specialized, and we plan to work closely with government institutions to make sure that we have access and funding for these treatments to ensure that they are provided to the people who need them most. Since around 80% of people in Mexico are dependent on social security, it is critical to make sure we are in the national healthcare system. A second important area of our operations is with classic or generic brands. There has been a significant change in the market recently, and generics have grown dramatically since 2007. At GSK Mexico, 38% of our sales come from our classic brands, illustrating the importance of this franchise.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Nobody thought that the generic market would grow like this. The majority of the volume of business now is in generics. Physicians are accepting a lot of companies prescribing generics drugs. Now, the regulations assure the consumer that the product is of top quality and at the best price. The volume is increasing, but the value is decreasing. Also, fixed costs do not change that much. Since the 1990s, there have been a few different crises, such as with the exchange rate. Companies have been cutting their budgets for a while now, so the challenge is how to become more successful on smaller budgets. We are beginning with the generic market now. Companies need to be accustomed to this different market. The regulations are slowing catching up with the market and the authorities are making changes, and I believe they will go further in the future. We are going through a market phase similar to that of the US, where generics are the top-selling products. We need to reinforce our strategies and how we do things. Companies need to be restructured, because we have large commercial areas that in this kind of market are not needed. They need to be development companies producing different kinds of products.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Roche is a research-focused healthcare global leader that combines both pharmaceuticals and diagnostics strengths. Our main goal at Roche is to address unmet medical needs through innovation in products and services for the early detection, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases. We are the world's largest biotechnological company, the world leader in cancer medication, and a market leader in virology. We also have a prominent global infrastructure: 170 subsidiaries worldwide, employing more than 10,000 scientists, and 14 drug manufacturing plants around the globe. Roche started its operations in Mexico in 1948, and ever since we have been focused on impacting the life quality of patients positively. It's been more than 60 years, and Roche Mexico is still playing a very important role in the development, production and marketing of innovative medical solutions. Roche is among the top five pharmaceutical companies in Mexico, and the diagnosis business continues to grow in a very positive way. The objective for Roche is, through innovation and research, to position itself as a global leader in the development of specific products and services for the early detection, prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases with a single purpose: to provide welfare and improve the life quality of patients.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Werner uses around 47 different Mexican carriers... and has a pool of up to 2,000 trailers dedicated to the country. We also have a temperature controlled division (TCU) flat beds, and intermodal services, all alongside Werner Global, which covers global freight by sea and air. Werner now has offices throughout the country, including all along the border with the US.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>CAF Mexico has become the leading provider of passenger trains in the country with the largest market share among all the players, and the company has experienced massive growth over the years, which led to the expansion of our manufacturing plant as well as our local services. One of our main priorities for the next few years is to finally set up a complete production chain in Mexico.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Mexico has the potential to continue growing in the world's economy. That said, we can focus more closely on the level of infrastructure that we have in terms of highways, airports, and seaports. For us, that means we will continue capitalizing on what FedEx is earning and contributing back to the economy of the country.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>AMTI is the intermediary between its partners and the government. We work heavily with customers in terms of regulations and information. We need to ensure that all the cargo that comes from the US goes directly to an intermodal terminal. Those terminals each have their own customs houses. We need to work with the customs in terms of arranging schedules. There are also some cargo types that cannot be introduced by intermodal services, and we need to coordinate them.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I believe that the government is very talented. The Salinas administration was very active. I think that the way that the Peña Nieto government has attacked the infrastructure problem has also been effective and created opportunities. When the government was dealing on a state level, I believe that it  did well and may have a chance at doing it well throughout the whole country. I am optimistic, but I think that the main problem will be in relation to financing this equation in regard to the world situation. The world is generally in a very uncertain period; there are three very difficult things happening, one of which is abnormal debts for both government and consumers. In addition, we are coming to the end of the baby-boom era, and negative cash flows will disappear from funds as baby-boomers fulfill the last phase of their lives. Finally, a young generation that is not creating wealth will emerge. Those three equations put together will likely take the liquidity out of the markets, and that is where I think that the government should be focusing its financing strategies. Fortunately, Mexico still has a population advantage, and that is a great opportunity for the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I think Mexico should focus on transport infrastructure. It is very important to develop the ports, railways, airports, and of course the roads and highways. The country has to prepare for the increased industry that Mexico is attracting and developing. For example, Mexico has huge export potential and doesn't have a harbor in the top-200 largest in the world. In terms of what Aldesa can contribute, we have an extensive experience in highways, tunnels, traffic systems, and airports. We are also leaders in railways with an experience of more than 600 kilometers. We have extensive expansion plans for Mexico in the coming years. We will continue to work in our core construction business of roads and energy infrastructure. However, there are new projects in which to expect participation, such as railways, water facilities, hospitals, and airports. Also, we are focused on private markets, where there is work to do: corporate and commercial buildings, hospitals and universities, and industrial facilities. In traffic, we have a huge opportunity to develop urban traffic systems, and there is a great need for this in Mexican cities. There is also major demand for security systems in Mexican cities. The traffic and security systems are very closely interlinked, and we offer complete packages that incorporate both aspects.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Grade-A retail space is in high demand. Mexico was closed for many years and its borders only began to open up around 20 years ago. Before, business was not very competitive. Today, the economy is completely open and there are many new products to buy. However, there are still many brands absent from Mexico City and many are looking to join. That is why there is a large demand for retail space. Triple-A space is also needed, and as we go down the market there is also demand. In Toluca, we are working on projects and without even seeking participants we are becoming fully leased. We are also renovating older projects and this is a positive reflection of growth. I expect that 2013 will be a good year for us as we have decided to go full-speed ahead on two projects and will be opening two large mixed-use developments. We believe that 2013 is going to lay important elements for the next six years of the new presidency. It is important that we make decisions to launch projects in 2013, despite the uncertainty that always surrounds the inauguration of a new president. Growth trends will surely continue.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are involved in the chartering, operation, and maintenance of offshore drilling rigs and vessels. Training is the most important aspect. You need to be able to provide good training with quality programs to meet PEMEX's regulations and safety standards. We are very strict with safety and have different training courses for our crews. People are our company's best asset and by giving our people the best training, support, and resources we can reflect that to our customers. We have managed to certify the company in a way that reflects our responsibility to our employees, and these employees reflect it when they are out working in the fields. Finding skilled and disciplined people involved in the oil and gas industry in Mexico is getting harder every day. Thankfully, we have not had any problems by creating a special recruiting program. We do not have as much rotation as other companies would have, because we take good care of our people and we assure them a long-term relationship with the company. Of course, there are some people that seek new opportunities elsewhere, but then again you have people coming from other companies to ours. This shortage of qualified personnel is a problem because there is so much demand and so many assets coming to the market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>GL Noble Denton has defined major accounts worldwide on which we focus our attention and PEMEX is one of those. That demonstrates that Mexico and PEMEX is a key element of our global strategy. With PEMEX, we have the classic certification projects along with risk analysis, and we have private clients that we are working with, in particular in verification. We have also some focused areas such as deep-water exploration. We have been in Mexico for about 16 years. When PEMEX started to do the first certification projects we were there and we have accompanied it all of the way through. We created verification units for to support the Mexican authorities with the supervision of mostly gas related activities, such as gas transport, distribution, and LNG import terminals. The verification of operation and maintenance activities has to be done over the course of the year, so we have to confirm that the operator complies with all points of the applicable official Mexican norm. We want to grow the marine services sector of our company in Mexico, since we see a lot of activity in this area, as well as participate more in gas pipeline projects. Those are pushed by the current low gas prices in the US and the rising demand in Mexico. This is a major area for us. On the other hand the pipelines and other infrastructure keep getting older and require greater efforts with regard to asset integrity management.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>It has been said that the energy reform being discussed for the second half of 2013 would open the market for certain segments, such as deep water. If the deep-water segment was open to private investment either through concessions or partnerships with PEMEX that would definitely shorten the timeframes. I was hoping that this would happen earlier, but I think that now is the right time. With the change of government and the atmosphere of cooperation that has been shown by the federal government with regard to education and telecommunications reform, I think that things are moving in the right direction and that these are positive trends. It is still going to be a slow year for us. PEMEX is going to tender some more deep-water drill rigs, so of course we are looking forward to working with those drilling companies. Also, we are excited about the development of the Lakach field. Right now, we need to be contracted by larger companies as the scope of those projects is very large. The deep-water prospects in Mexico are very promising and energy reforms will certainly speed up the process.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>DAIRY NOW</h4><p>In 2011, we entered into negotiations with Santa Clara. In May 2012, we closed that deal and now it is part of the Coca-Cola System through Jugos Del Valle. We were missing something, which was dairy, and for that reason we wanted to incorporate Santa Clara.</p><h4>ACCESS ALL AREAS</h4><p>We occupy around one-third of each segment in which we compete, and we compete in all kinds of segments including juices and teas. Fruit is easily obtainable here, and making juice at home is common.</p><h4>STREET LEVEL</h4><p>When you enter into this kind of category, trade is very important. We have a strong domestic channel through the small retailers you see on every street.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GRAND OPENING</h4><p>We started operations in Mexico in January 2009 with the grand opening of the plant here. Before that, we had been shipping from our plants in the US to our customers. We decided to come together with Hershey's, one of our main customers in Mexico, and open a plant here.</p><h4>COMPOUND &amp; REAL</h4><p>We have two main markets in chocolate: real chocolate and compound. We produce both here, as we do everywhere in the world. It's about a 50-50 split between the two. We have major customers for chocolate as well as compounds.</p><h4>NICHE MARKET</h4><p>The volume is still small; however, growth is huge. The chocolate market may be growing 2%-3% per year, but the niche market we are in is growing double-digit. You can see the evidence for this in the supermarkets, there are more and more sugar-free products every day.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SMALL BEGINNINGS</h4><p>The company will celebrate its centennial in 2014. It started as a distribution company and 15 years later, in 1929, my grandfather joined. In 1947, we made the first joint venture with McCormick &amp; Company. As far as I know, this joint venture is one of the oldest in Mexico.</p><h4>RELEVANT IN THE MARKET</h4><p>We export mainly to the US market, to our company MegaMex. But we also have a small business in Central America. However, our main objective still remains the US market because Mexican foods have become very relevant in that market.</p><h4>CHANGING TIMES</h4><p>In Mexico, since housewives are increasingly joining the workforce, the need for convenient products to cook and eat is becoming more relevant. This is also reflected in the expansion of convenience stores in the country, where high rotation products and easy to use  foodstuffs are key.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GOING PUBLIC</h4><p>One of the reasons for going public was to take full advantage of the franchise model. The fast-food and quick-service restaurant (QSR) market at that time was developing under the strong leadership of US brands such as Domino's Pizza and Burger King. We decided to take the company public in order to buy other franchises from Burger King and Domino's Pizza.</p><h4>STRONG BRANDS</h4><p>We have to realize that we pay for strong brands to do their job in terms of innovation and product development. In general terms, we make 80% of our sales through eight brands, but they develop global menus by themselves.</p><h4>SOURCING LOCALLY</h4><p>We started importing everything 20 years ago, but we have been moving into local sourcing since the beginning, especially after 1995 with the peso's devaluation against the dollar. We now source around 80% from local producers and 20% through imports.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>It is a myth that the Mexican insurance sector is underdeveloped. I started working in this sector 30 years ago, and have always heard the same complaints. In terms of GDP, the Mexican insurance sector represents less than 2% of the total. It has been like that for the last 25 years. So, yes, there is a huge opportunity and ACE sees that. In the near future we will grow our presence. We are looking for opportunities, and we are ready to invest. We believe that the life business holds a lot of opportunity for an insurance company. We began in this sector in Mexico City and we are moving into Puebla, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. We are going to start using agents as well as increase our own sales force. We already have 50 agents and are looking at long-term undertakings focused on savings, education, and pensions projects. Mexico is a very competitive market for insurance. All of the big players are present. There are also some large Mexican firms as well as new international firms in the market. This means that we have to remain competitive. In my eyes, insurance companies have two assets. One is our balance sheet. Fortunately for us, ACE has a very strong balance sheet. Our other strength is people.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>One of the bigger changes we were able to make was to build a very solid brand, which allowed us to create a price premium. Four years ago, 0% of Mexicans knew us, and now 85% do. It was one of the fastest-growing brands in Mexico, in a category that is not exactly the most popular. We are pleased with that, and it shows that the company's level of attention is very high. Insurance in Mexico, as in many other countries, faces the challenge of building customer trust. The way we are trying to tackle this is to offer innovative products as proof of our reliability. For example, we offer life insurance dedicated to diabetics. We have launched other innovative services including 24-hour medical support, available on the phone or on location. A preconception we tried to change is that SMEs have small problems; this is not true. In fact, 75% of SMEs are faced with large problems that could bankrupt their company. If a company is short on money, then they start to lose customers. This applies not only SMEs, but also to the people related to the company, workers, and their spouses. Therefore, AXA Seguros Mexico has been offering a down payment of at least 50% of a company's claims; if it has a problem, we offer the necessary cash in less than a week, which allows the company to continue operations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have very informal markets, very small firms, a very young population, and low-income levels. That is why, structurally, the demand for insurance is less than in other countries. But that is an opportunity. A lot of families are going to be formed in the years to come. They will have mortgages, cars, and children, and the demand for health insurance is going to grow. We think that the country is going to keep growing. If we transform the structure of the economy by passing some other structural reforms, I am very optimistic about this government. If that happens it will raise the income of many families and also raise the gross distribution that will transform the labor market to where we will have more formal markets. That is why I am very positive with respect to the insurance sector in Mexico. It has been growing faster than GDP and I think that the opportunity is huge. This is the way that many firms abroad see things. This is a very strategic market that most of the important firms in the world are pinpointing. After Brazil, Mexico is the largest market, followed by Argentina. The differences are huge but I think Mexico is going down the path of very rapid expansion.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>DOUBLING UP</h4><p>We had just 2 MW of installed capacity in 2006, and we have just crossed the milestone of the first 1,000 MW of capacity in March 2012. We expect to double that by 2013.</p><h4>FULL GRID</h4><p>In solar we are seeing that costs are decreasing and efficiency is increasing dramatically, but we believe that it will take a few years still to reach full competitiveness. However, now we are close to full grid parity.</p><h4>SUPPORT THE GOALS</h4><p>The long-term goals for the industry need to be supported by  sound, long-term planning, an even better legal framework, an expanded and reinforced transmission grid, and the growth of small producers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ALL IN OAXACA</h4><p>Our first wind farm was built in 2009 and became operational in April 2010. All of our farms are in Oaxaca, which has fantastic wind resources. It is one of the best places for farms of their type.</p><h4>BEING COMPETITIVE</h4><p>It is important to know that there is no subsidy for renewables in Mexico like there is in Europe with the feed-in tariff or with production and investment tax credits in the US. This means we have a different playing field than in the other countries, and we have to be more competitive.</p><h4>SOLID OPTIMISM</h4><p>We are still busy on the construction of our third wind farm and we are bidding for another private project. For 2014, we are keeping busy with new projects. We are looking into solar, and there may be a possibility with a small producer.</p><p><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GOOD REASON</h4><p>We consider Mexico an important country for the development of renewables in the Latin American region. It is the second biggest wind energy market in Latin America, and that in itself is a very good reason to be present.</p><h4>A WIDE SPECTRUM</h4><p>GL Garrad Hassan works with developers, lenders, investors, government institutions, regulators, and NGOs. We work for project owners and operators as well. The company covers the spectrum of clients in the Mexican renewables market.</p><h4>ROOM TO CHANGE</h4><p>The energy matrix in Mexico is dominated by conventional sources of energy. There is a large portion of that matrix that can be changed from fossil fuels, gas, and nuclear to renewable wind and solar.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SELF-SUPPLY</h4><p>There are a number of firms that are executing projects related to interconnection capacity under the self-supply model. The self-supply model is a very particular innovation for Mexico, where private companies can build projects to supply their own power needs.</p><h4>NOW UNTIL THEN</h4><p>We carried out an assessment of Mexico clean energy goals, and our conclusion is that in this market wind energy has the potential to meet all of the clean energy needs for Mexico from now until 2024.</p><h4>OUTSTANDING POSITION</h4><p>We are the leader in the industry in terms of moving technology forward, and we have the largest manpower base in R&amp;D. We have outstanding facilities in a number of areas.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have a huge manufacturing site in Monterrey where we manufacture for the US and Latin America, as well as for Mexico's internal use. We don't manufacture all types of products; instead, we only manufacture desktops for the corporate sector. However, we are currently thinking about expanding this space. The biggest strength of Lenovo is its emerging markets. We look for countries that have a low PC penetration rate. India, Brazil, and Mexico all have below a 25% penetration rate, meaning those countries have huge opportunities. Toward the end of 2012, Lenovo bought the second largest PC vendor in Brazil, and it opened a manufacturing site in Argentina. We are now the number one vendor of PCs in India. In Mexico, we are the number two vendor, and we want to go for number one. Smartphones are another key area; we expect to introduce them in 2Q2013. We have completed a joint venture with EMC, the largest disk supplier here. We want to sell storage and new products with it. We have also entered into the server and workstation business. We are driving new lines in Mexico, plus our traditional desktops and laptops for both corporate entities and consumers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is an extremely important market for us for many reasons. One is that it is a very important consumption market—the 10th largest in the world—and it is the fifth largest emerging market. Mexico is very important because it is both large and growing very fast. The other reason that Mexico is important is due to the operations that we have in Guadalajara, where we have a design center that is one of four or five similar design centers that we have around the world. The center performs very advanced engineering, and it has the highest penetration of Master's and PhD graduates of any site in Mexico. They are working on everything from education-specific products to PC chips to product validation and testing. It really focuses on the latter stages of design, and it does a lot of market testing. We have gone from around 30 staff to 1,000 in just over 10 years with the support of the government. Intel recently announced a significant investment of $177 million in Guadalajara. We are in the process of designing a new building and adding about 400 new engineers. This is another example of why Mexico is important to Intel and what it does.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Serving SMEs in technology has always been a hurdle throughout the world. Generally, the companies are family owned with no specific IT person and little interest in technology. To get them to use technology, we have worked very hard to build a subsidiary that is able to work with smaller companies that need only 20-30 domain names and a website to communicate with customers. This leg of the business was built to be extremely easy to use and very low cost. This company, SuEmpresa.com, was specifically designed to serve SMEs. As described, companies can purchase on-demand services from a single email account or a domain, build e-commerce stores, and backup their information in the cloud. Obviously, everything as a service is charged to their credit cards or any other easy way of payment. This initiative has been very well received by the SME community. However, with the lack of trust in credit card transactions in the Mexican e-commerce market, there is still work to be done. The banks have done a lot to increase confidence and e-commerce is gaining traction—people are beginning to feel more comfortable.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Mexico is ranked in the top 10 regarding the consumption of appliances in the world. The domestic market is very important; as well as being a global operating platform to export to North America, meaning the US and Canada, and the rest of the world. The proximity to the US, the largest consumer of appliances in the world, is very relevant for our business. China will be very close in the near future, but for now, it is still the US that demands the majority of appliances in the world. We have three R&amp;D centers here in Mexico, one for washers, one for ranges, and one for refrigerators. Our R&amp;D produces technology for Mexico and the world; we support the science that we have here, but we also have our global technologies and tech centers around the world working on different things. We can have people in China, India, the US, and Mexico working on a project together. I think many people are looking to Mexico as a potential growth engine, bringing investments, products, and  services into this market. Our mission is to focus all our resources to satisfy our customers.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The importance of Mexico is clear: strategies are easy to develop and growth is steady. Considering Mexico as an export market, we can compare the country directly to Turkey, Indonesia, or other established and developing regional hubs. In that tier of export platforms, Mexico even has advantages. The main reason is the demographic dividend, which is very apparent in 2013. The strongest birth rate year in Mexico's history was 1994, when 3 million people were born. These are entering the local labor market now. This is symbolic and will set the pace for the next 20-25 years, when we will see the development of a very nice age pyramid with a huge amount of workers and very few dependents on the top and lower sides. Meanwhile, there is a clear decline in the number of immigrants heading to the US. Whether we need the wall at the border is up for debate; the net immigration has been zero, which is a clear indication that many Mexicans are deciding to stay home because more and more jobs are becoming available here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Samsung Mexico was established in Mexico in 1988 as a small branch office focusing on sales. In 1995, we established a  company in Mexico called Samsung Electronics Mexico. For Samsung, it is very important to be here, because from here we deliver many global products to the US and Canada. In terms of Samsung, Mexico belongs to the top-15 companies worldwide under the Samsung name. We have two plants here, in addition to the main headquarters in Mexico City. Mexico has one of the Samsung's biggest plants in terms of our TV business outside of South Korea. We are producing almost 13 million TV units per year in Tijuana in a 272,000-sqm plant; it is huge. More than 75% of what we produce goes to the US and Canada, 20% stays within our domestic market, and the other 5% goes to Central America. Mexico belongs to our North American headquarters and our Latin America headquarters is in Brazil, which also supplies South America. In spite of economic problems, we are in very good shape. The trend throughout 2012 has been very positive.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Mexico has the largest employee headcount at Johnson Controls outside of the US at 26,400 employees. Mexico has a great advantage in its people. Skilled labor and well-educated professionals are available in almost all regions of the country. Our company has four different businesses: building efficiency, power solutions, seating and interiors, and electronics for cars. The automotive industry will be the biggest area of growth. The last plant that we built was constructed in Querétaro in 2012. We are expecting to build another two plants in 2013 and 2014, which will be in the northern part of Mexico. We are looking for places to install these facilities at the moment. We have a strong market share in all of our businesses, and we have a powerful culture of leadership. It is challenging to gain more market share, but we are growing in the industry and gaining share from our competitors. We believe that Mexico has all the right elements for growth, including a very sound economic foundation, solid institutions, a great location, and, most importantly, smart and hard working people with strong family and individual values.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Mitsui is a global trading company and an investor in many countries. In Mexico, we have a history dating back more than 100 years, when we established our first branch office here in 1910. We started in Mexico as a trading company, and we remain a trading company today. We continue to import steel and chemical products, and also export food stock such as orange juice. We recognize that Mexico has achieved a good macro-economic balance after past crises and has now become an automotive manufacturing base for the North American market. In addition, Mexico itself is abundant in natural resources like gas, oil, and minerals. The country is also very much open to supporting foreign investment. We believe there are a lot of business opportunities here. We intend to expand our infrastructure-related projects as the sector needs private participation due to the large level of investment required. We are also interested in expanding to accommodate growth in the automotive and manufacturing sectors.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Around  30% of my patients are foreigners; but medical tourism is growing faster in Colombia. The high quality processes and the natural appearance we can recreate make Colombia a Center in the world map as a Medical tourism point of renown. We perform around 27 to 30 surgeries per week with an annual total of 1,250 or 1,300 patients per year—30% men and 70% females. La Font is the most technologically advanced plastic surgery clinic available in Colombia. The main attraction for this kind of tourism is security. Our patients don't risk their health or their lives; and the excellent natural results make them come back again and again.  Our high quality processes and results in natural appearance make us unique. La Font also has a hotel and a medical spa, making it the most unique plastic surgery clinic specialized in medical tourism.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Some general physicians—or even people who are not medical doctors—believe they can carry out procedures such as injections or botox. They often try to do liposuction, believing it to be an easy procedure. These physicians even try to complete more daring surgeries such breast implants. However, it is necessary to always have the complete training. Unfortunately in Colombia, once a student finishes medicine at university, the country gives them the title of medical doctor and surgeon, but when they finish, they are not surgeons. These people are general physicians that are not specialized. In Colombia, there are only two medical specialties that are regulated by law: anesthesia and radiology. All the other specialties are not regulated. Aesthetic surgery cannot be studied independent from the wider category of plastic surgery; you need to be a reconstructive or plastic surgeon in order to specialize in aesthetics.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The most common treatment among our services is laser lipolysis. We put optical fibers under the skin causing the dilution of fat in all areas of the body, and with a special feature that leaves the skin absolutely smooth. This treatment is specially indicated for people around 10 kilograms overweight, although people can undergo this treatment for beauty purposes as well in order to shape up their body. The cost of this treatment starts from $3,500 and can go to up to $13,000. Among our clients there are many celebrities, actors and actresses, and models. In fact, we also have many sportsmen coming to our center. In terms of balance between men and women, five years ago 15% of our patients were men. However, today this figure has already doubled, and younger men are increasingly coming. However, we have a wide service portfolio, including facial rejuvenation, breast and buttocks lifts, the extraction of polymers, excessive sweating treatments, and laser hair removal.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Many years ago, if you hit someone with your car, you would leave the body there and that was that. Now, the government has created a fund so you can take the person to hospital. I believe we also need to make a fund to protect against malpractice. The idea behind my law was that any doctor entering the market would need to pay into a special system each year. After this, the doctor would need to take an exam annually; if they fail the exam, then the amount they pay into the system would increase. It obligates people to improve their knowledge. We have a special regulation particular to Colombia—the only one that exists—that makes it legal for any doctor to perform any medical procedure, from brain surgery to rhinoplasty; the law does not define specializations. Some governmental officials have relatives working in the cosmetic world, which is why the laws are set that way. With an improved law, doctors would be able to do any procedure; however, doctors outside their specialty would pay much higher insurance rates because the patients would be at risk.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>President Santos has indicated that 10% of the oil and natural resources revenue will be invested in science, technology, and innovation, and that is a huge jump. However, even though the resources are in place, we do not have the desired number of people with a PhD or the infrastructure for research labs. We are significantly increasing the number of international faculty coming to Colombia and making joint ventures and strategic alliances with research centers and universities worldwide. Universidad del Rosario used to concentrate only on teaching, but in the 1990s we decided to move toward a teaching university offering high quality research, with the aim that within 50 years we could transform into a research university. It is a challenging transformation, but I think we are doing it well in the areas where we can conduct high-quality research. For example, we have a team of 34 scientists researching a vaccine for malaria. We have a very accomplished group of experts in autoimmune diseases, and we are starting a high-level natural sciences school, which we were previously lacking.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We welcome government efforts to facilitate the access of all types of students to university through, for example, wider financial tools. We need to further invest in widening coverage, as well as further increasing quality standards in the higher education sector in Colombia. The country has around 350 higher education institutions, and quality is a key determinant in education. To raise quality standards, more investment is needed. For example, we must strengthen certification processes at the national level; today, no more than 30 institutions out of the 350 across the country pass minimum standards nationally, in accordance with the main regulatory and certification bodies in Colombia. The Universidad del Norte prioritizes a student's transformation during his/her education stage, and I believe that should be the trend among other universities and higher education centers in the country. In 2000, our university had less than 1% of its student body coming from the low-income social strata, whereas now that figure stands at 30%.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The university has exchange programs and a number of other international agreements that allow our students to learn about the global context and interact with it, offering dual degrees that are recognized in the best schools of higher education on several continents. Over the years, Universidad Externado de Colombia has materialized over 187 international agreements for academic programs with, among others, the following reputable universities: Université Panthéon-Assas Paris-II, Université Paris I Panthéon-Sorbonne, Université Toulouse I Capitole, the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Columbia University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Universidad Carlos III of Madrid, Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza, Ruhr-University Bochum (Germany), the University of Wollongong (Australia), and the University of Manitoba. It thus promotes the universal education of teachers and students, the development of better and more relevant research, the acquisition and exchange of culture, knowledge, and work and study materials.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In general, engineering represents about 45% of our number of students and research. In 2012, the university was accredited by AMBA, a US accreditation institution. That is very unique and it opens up a lot of opportunities for our graduates, as it is a faculty that has been growing. In the mining sector, we feel there are shortages of Colombian engineers, and we are working to find a solution. Three years ago, we created a new program called “geoscience“ or “sciences of the Earth.“ It is not in the engineering faculty but in the science faculty, though there are a lot of connections with engineering. One of the things that characterizes this university is that about 22% of our students are graduating in two disciplines. This gives them a broader view of what is happening in the world, and it is a much more thorough and solid education. There are institutions that have really progressed over the last two decades, but there is a long way to go. As with most Latin American countries, only a fraction of the people have access to higher education.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>AES Chivor is the affiliate of AES in Colombia and owns a 1,000 MW hydro facility, the third largest plant in the country. In a regular year, it produces around 8% of the power generated in the country. The government originally built Chivor in the 1970s when the government was in charge of the power sector. At that time, Chivor was part of ISA, a government-owned integrated utility that comprised generation and transmission. During the early 1990s, Colombia's electricity sector had a crisis due to an extended period of low rainfall. The country is heavily affected by the warming and cooling of the Pacific Ocean, called the El Niño and La Niña weather cycle. Colombia had a very strong El Niño, meaning dry weather, in the early 1990s. The infrastructure was not in place, and the country had to ration energy in 1992 and 1993. It is important for the authorities to evaluate crises like these and try to find solutions to the country's problems. Colombia accomplished this, and the authorities deregulated the electricity sector.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>From Colombia, we cover Colombia itself and some of the Central American countries and the Caribbean. We follow these countries from Bogotá. In terms of electricity, Colombia is one of the richest countries in hydro potential. However, we do not have enough demand to exploit this potential. The only way is to sell energy to neighboring countries. This is how we expect the electricity sector will evolve in the future. Despite the fact that markets are mature enough to evolve to be more international, political willingness and regulations have to evolve and accept that electricity could be transferred from one country to another. Electricity is a commodity but, internationally speaking, it is not built as a commodity yet in this region. Technically speaking, there are no barriers or restrictions to getting interconnected across the continent. There is the possibility to transport electricity from Madrid to Moscow without any technical restrictions today.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our first task is to continue working on ongoing projects, which make up about 70% of our portfolio. We have a $2.2 billion investment plan for the next four years. Colombia accounts for 35% of that, and we also participate in the Peruvian and Guatemalan markets. Our main projects are in gas distribution, mainly in Peru and Colombia. There's also an $874 million power transmission project in Guatemala, as well as power transmission projects worth $300 million in Colombia. We have placed a bid for a power line network in Chile, and we have an eye on Panama and Brazil, so we're very busy. They're very important projects for the country's interconnected power system. The government opened four projects for bidding, and we won three out of four. These are 230 kW high-voltage projects. One of the projects is in Armenia, another is near Valle, and the third is Tesalia, which will enable connections with the large power-generating project in Quibo.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Endesa's operations in Colombia are very stable and well balanced in the power generation segment with Emgesa, and in the distribution segment with Codensa. In 2012, we celebrated our 15th anniversary in the country, and over this period we have consolidated our operations in Colombia. We carried out economic and management restructuring strategies at both Emgesa and Codensa. We have grown in terms of power generation assets with, for example, the acquisition of the Cartagena plant and the merger with Betania, among others. We have ongoing plans to expand our power generation portfolio with projects such as the expansion of Salaco to 144 MW. We expect that over the next two years we will reach 3,500 MW of installed capacity. In the distribution field, we have a similar story; we could increase our customer portfolio to more than 700,000 people, and today we have around 2.7 million customers in Colombia.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>I strongly believe in the gas sector as part of the company's commitment to environmental responsibility. We want to be the leaders of environmental responsibility in Colombia. We have a plan to strengthen natural gas as an alternative for sustainable transportation. We believe that natural gas is the best and cleanest fuel available. EPM has an advantage in Medellí­n, which is the only city in Colombia where the mass transportation articulated bus system is fueled by natural gas. This is a good start. At EPM, we have a large fleet of vehicles that we plan to convert to natural gas as well. At the moment, about 40% of our fleet runs on natural gas, so we plan to lead by example. Medellí­n will be a precursor for natural gas, and I'm sure that we will be leaders in that regard. Our proprietary network of gas stations will help many corporate clients and people to feel comfortable converting their vehicles.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are two categories of coal mining in Colombia: steam coal and metallurgical/coking coal. In steam coal, we have been an important player since the 1980s, and are now a strong player internationally. We are producing roughly about 81 million tons of coal per year for an industry we have developed over the last 25 years. In that segment we have seen particular success because the mines are located near the Atlantic Coast and the logistics have been fairly simple and straightforward. In terms of coking coal, we have discovered very good deposits in Cundinamarca, Boyacá, and in the north in Santander. The difficulty is logistics because the geography is complex. However, the potential is there. Colombia produced around 4.5 million tons of coking coal so far in 2012, which is a low level. We have to de-bottleneck the infrastructure, using the government's tools to move into public-private partnerships (PPPs). The process will take some time, largely because coking coal is not stable in terms of price fluctuation, in contrast to the steam coal segment, where companies can function in the financial market and hedge prices. As long as Colombia works toward improving its infrastructure, coking coal will become an important player within the local coal industry. The steam coal industry is already seeing companies make huge expansion plans. We are the leaders of a new era in terms of technology and investment in coking coal in Colombia.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The greatest achievement to date has been the building of a team with high levels of expertise in the mining sector capable of working with international standards. This level of expertise is only just beginning to be built in the country. This can be evidenced by the absence of major metal mining projects developed over the past 20 years in the country; only small mining projects have been developed with local engineering or even in the absence of it in some cases. Therefore, when Tribeca, the largest private equity fund in Colombia, decided to build a mining company with international standards, it aimed at creating a leader in the sector capable of operating in the international market. Gold was the first segment our company tackled, but we have also entered segments such as zinc, lead, and silver, and are considering copper as well. Therefore, one of our top priorities has been to build the human resource talent and the development of proper standards and procedures in all areas: geology and exploration, project and plant management, HSEC-Q, marketing, and human resources. Hence, although there are plenty of talented people in the country, there is a need to improve the knowledge and capabilities base to manage and develop projects with international standards.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In Colombia, large mining companies produce huge volumes of thermal coal due to the margins being less than those for metallurgical coal. CERX came to Colombia because of the infancy of the met coal industry here. In 2011, Colombia produced approximately 86 million tons of coal, but only 4.4 million of that was metallurgical coal. The coal industry in Colombia has displayed slow growth due in large part to the transportation costs of moving product to the ports. Since global metallurgical coal prices have increased significantly, there is now a market for met coal in the interior of the country. I foresee that met coal prices will always see the fluctuation we have seen on the thermal side, however, instead of the fluctuation being down in the $60-$90 range, it is going to be up in the $150-$200 range. Colombia now has an opportunity to exploit its metallurgical coal resources. There is a large thermal coal supply globally, but the supply of met coal is considerably smaller and every day there is a decrease in that supply. For this reason, it was attractive for me to come to Colombia because there is a product here that is in high demand and should remain so in the future.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The main focus that we have in this administration is to make the company profitable while continuing to grow. By that, I do not mean that we have not been profitable in the past, but this year we have a strong focus on making the operation more efficient. To reach our goals, we are focusing on many initiatives: the first one is improving our customer service strategy. We are working heavily on streamlining the processes in which we interact with our customers by taking into account their specific needs. With the second initiative we are focusing on launching our brand new 4G LTE network. There are many challenges with this launch, as Colombia is a market where one operator has approximately 80% of the mobile voice traffic. It is difficult to get customers from that operator because of its market power; UNE has to be very innovative to get around this situation. In that direction, we have worked together with international experts in order to launch the LTE commercial operation by identifying the connectors in social networks, letting them try our product for four months so they would talk about our services. This was very successful.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I believe ETB is strong in many areas with a huge potential for growth. Although it is mainly concentrated in Bogotá, the company has corporate services around the country. We are probably the biggest provider in the country in corporate services, serving the largest companies in Colombia; however, our main retail market is still Bogotá. The capital represents 45% of Colombia's GDP regarding telecommunications. ETB's main product and the company's revenue driver is in fixed lines. Broadband is becoming very important and that is where I see the most potential. We have 15% of the broadband in the country, so we have a long way to go. ETB doesn't have its own TV service, although it has a strategic alliance with Direct TV; therefore, ETB is planning to launch its own TV service with a huge potential of revenue growth. Regarding the bidding of 4G, all the telecommunications operators have gotten involved in a discussion about the dominant position of one of the players, which has impacted the market significantly. Three months ago, no one talked about this process and today the 4G discussions has become a main issue for the government, congress, media, and customers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2012, we invested around $450 million, and that's the average annual amount Telefónica invests. I truly believe that the IT industry is one of the key investment industries in the national economy, along with very important industries for the country such as energy and mining, and we have to keep in mind the role IT plays in making economies more attractive and dynamic. Today, Latin American markets do not differ much in terms of the level of advancement and application of new technology. The government of Colombia knows about the role IT plays in the development of the country and that is very beneficial for the industry and economic development. In recent years, Telefónica has become a leading firm in terms of innovation. For example, three years ago we launched a new project at the regional level to encourage entrepreneurs in the IT industry to come forward with their ideas, expose them before a jury, and perhaps win some financial support for their development. Telefónica launched this project specifically in Colombia, and today we are offering it in other markets as well. Overall, Colombia represents a very important operating market for the company in terms of investment and economic growth, as the country offers huge business opportunities with clear rules for potential investors.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are offshore activities in both the Pacific and the Caribbean region, though resources in the Caribbean are more advanced now. The first site that started producing was Chuchupa, just off the Guajira peninsula, and it was, and continues to be, a Chevron venture. Chevron provides approximately 70% of the gas in Colombia, and it has played an important role in the development of the gas industry since that discovery in the 1970s. From this field, gas is exported to Venezuela. What is happening, however, is that production in this field is declining. That is the first challenge for us in Colombia. On top of that, we at Equion provide 30% of the gas in the country. In terms of private companies, we are the second largest domestic gas supplier. We know how to manage this market, and we know how to manage gas. The two companies that have this experience are Chevron and Equion. For now, the main challenge is to replace this declining field. We are looking along the shore to replace this gas and have two blocks on the Caribbean coast now. In the first exploration area, RC5, we are looking for gas. It is a relief for the country to have another source that can produce gas apart from Chevron. That is our challenge; it is not just an exploration project, it is a project that can help provide Colombia with energy security over the medium to long term.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Hocol started operations in the Magdalena Valley in the South of Colombia. We then moved to the Llanos Basin, where we have very important blocks and a field called Celote. In this field we produce 60% of our total output—19,000 barrels a day (bbl/d) come from this block. We also purchased other blocks during the different auction rounds held by the Agencia Nacional de Hidrocarburos (ANH) in 2008 and 2010. We have established a very good position in the Llanos Basin, where we are a very important player. We also occupy a very important and strong position in the foothills of Los Llanos, where we have two significant blocks: Mundo Nuevo and Niscota. We made a discovery of condensate and natural gas in Niscota in 2009 as a result of the first drilling we did in this block. We are now evaluating wells to confirm the discovery and gather information about the dimensions of the field. After establishing a good position in the Llanos Basin, we moved to the Lower Magdalena Basin in the north of the country. There we have five blocks, with two discoveries in the Saman Block. Bonga 1 revealed natural gas reserves in December 2011, and in January or February 2012 we discovered more gas. We have made seven impressive discoveries over the last 12 months. It is a very impressive record and we are very proud of our work here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Talisman has three centers of operation: Southeast Asia, the North Sea, and North America. The company produces the equivalent of 425,000 bbl/d. Southeast Asia is a mixture of oil and gas, and the pricing of gas there is linked to oil. The business in the North Sea is principally oil with some gas. The business in North America is very much a natural gas business and increasingly non conventional. Talisman is one of the largest players in the non-conventional shale sector in North America. We have substantial positions in Pennsylvania and Texas among others. As for Colombia, we would like to create a fourth center of operations in South America and Colombia. This is where we are starting. Our public objective in the near term is to achieve 50,000 bbl/d by 2015. This is a growth area for us. Right now, we own 49% of Equion, and our share of its production rights now is roughly 17,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now we are producing a little oil ourselves, roughly 500 barrels of oil per day, so we are roughly at 17,500 barrels per day in Colombia. Our goal is to get to 50,000 by 2015. Our plan was to spend in around $120 million on exploration. Our development plan was to spend roughly $300 million overall.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>There are regulations in Europe in terms of tire labeling, which has also influenced Chinese tire makers. Developers are working on what they call “green“ tires that are fuel-efficient. For example, three or four years ago, Chinese tires could not be retreaded, but now they are more environmentally friendly. The change in the quality of the tires is measurable, which is important for us. The tire market has changed dramatically over the last few years, as the four big tire companies in Colombia—Goodyear, Michelin, Bridgestone, and Pirelli—are assuming different roles and taking on different market shares. The introduction of Chinese tires in the market has changed the picture. Companies are beginning to rethink their business and how to address the challenges. In Colombia and in Latin America, the big tire companies are going through a very tough period. If they do not change their way of thinking, they will have even more problems in the near future. These companies have to choose whether they are going to fight the low-price tires or focus on the high-end premium market. Previously, companies were accustomed to fighting across the whole chain, but now they have to adapt and specialize in high-quality premium tires. The market has shrunk significantly for the bigger brands in the face of Chinese competition.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>From 1999 to 2003, Bridgestone followed a traditional strategy. In 2003, it decided that operations in Colombia needed to report to another operation, because at that time there were many security problems in the country. Bridgestone decided that the local operations would report directly to Venezuela. After 2010, when the violence declined, we had very good business in Colombia that was starting to grow. At that time, Venezuela had issues, and we removed Bridgestone Colombia from Venezuela's oversight, and now Ecuador reports to the Colombia office. My challenge was to disconnect Bridgestone Colombia from Venezuela and make it into a new subsidiary of Bridgestone America. Today, Colombia is the youngest subsidiary in the world. When people buy tires, they don't make an investment. Nobody buys tires for their value; they buy them for price. However, car performance rests on tires. It is a very important product and people should care about it. We are working on brand building and brand value, which is very important because we are Bridgestone, the number one company in the world for tires. We are not number one in Colombia, and there is a long way to go to gain a bigger market share. We will not be at number one in the short term, but we aim to be the best in Colombia. This is our focus.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Asian imports have established a strong presence in Colombia. Five years ago, premium brands, such as Pirelli, Goodyear, Michelin, and Bridgestone, represented 60% to 70% of the market. Today, this has been inverted. Asian brands hold the majority market share, and the remaining 30% is premium brands. Premium brands differ in several aspects including warranty, technology, cost structure, and development, which make the products distinctive. We have effectively implemented our global strategy to develop sales in high-performance tires with greater value-added and performance. These range from tires of 15 and 17 inches all the way up to SUV tires (18, 20, and 22 inches). The market is not very established yet, but it has been growing a lot and it is where Pirelli wants to be. However, truck and radial tires, which have been very successful in Colombia, are the main focuses.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We started in some places that were not popular five years ago, like Yopal and Arauca. Those small cities have developed a lot since we started. Yopal is now a medium-sized city, the capital of Casanare department, where 80% of the oil-exporting companies are based. We started with two flights daily; now we have 12 flights daily and the traffic is increasing by 50% annually. We are planning to open a new route from Barranquilla to Aruba and from Bogotá to Valledupar. There are still many medium-sized cities in Colombia that have not been connected yet, and we plan to connect them efficiently with point-to-point services. Bucaramanga and Pereira are large cities, but in order to get from one to the other, you have to go through Bogotá. When we started the company, Cartagena and Barranquilla were the fifth and sixth largest cities in the country, but in order to get to Cartagena, passengers had to come to Bogotá and spend three or four hours in the airport. It was like flying to New York. We can now offer the same flights from Bucaramanga-Cartagena and Bucaramanga-Barranquilla in an hour. Arauca is another popular route because there is oil exploration there. In 2012, we carried 600,000 passengers. We plan to grow between 30% and 40%, so we should have around 800,000 passengers over 2013. We've already bought the aircraft, and we are fixing them to accommodate the new numbers. We have 13 aircraft in total.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our major achievements have been related to changes in the fleet and service. We started operations with older planes back in 1962, but more than 10 years prior to that the Air Force launched this enterprise as a service for Colombia's isolated territories. Then the government decided to formalize the service and Satena became an airline, separate from the Air Force but still very attached to it. Therefore, we have operated services as Satena for 50 years, but even more with the Air Force. We started with DC3s, DC4s, PBY Catalina, and Beavers. We have made some changes to the fleet, but we still offer the same service. Even now, we still serve the same destinations that we did 50 years ago, because it is a social service and other airlines are not interested in traveling to isolated destinations. Satena is not like basic airlines in Colombia, whose main purpose is commercial so as to make revenues for their shareholders. The principle mission for Satena, the Air Force, and the Minister of Defense is to integrate Colombia and serve remote territories through Satena. This provides people in those areas with more chances for economic and social development. We expect numbers to be more or less the same as in 2011, because we are in the process of renewing the fleet. In 2011, we serviced almost 1 million passengers. As we have been changing the fleet, we lost some of the seats for sale, and we expect to end the year with similar numbers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are operating A320-200s, which is an excellent aircraft for our target market. This broke the preconception in Colombia that if you are a new airline entering the market you start with small aircraft. The A320-200 can hold up to 180 passengers. The more seats we can put on an airplane, the lower the cost per seat. We looked at a number of aircraft from the smallest to the largest, and the A320 offered us reliability and efficiency, and so we decided to use the A320. In the first four months of operations, the reliability of the aircraft was 99.6%, which is very high; we are delighted with the aircraft. The concept of the airline is completely different. The first European and American airplanes were very comfortable and luxurious. The airlines have always focused on the services that will generate more revenue to get those types of passengers on board. However, what some started to realize approximately 25 years ago is that when a passenger needs to travel for short distances they are willing to forego many luxuries. In the traditional airline model the problem is that they offer many services that the passenger does not want: they offer TVs, VIP lounges, international connectivity, and world alliances. The reality is that the majority of passengers—close to 80%—will never travel internationally. We conducted a survey, and the most popular answers were safety, then the price, financing, and finally performance.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FREE TRADE</h4><p>All the new commercial agreements  Colombia has signed with several countries are very advantageous and positive for the country, and the logistics sector will play a key role in developing them.</p><h4>R&amp;D</h4><p>We are in the process of transforming our company from a simple logistics operator to a fourth-party logistics (4PL) company, which means becoming an integrator that assembles the resources, capabilities, and technology to design, build, and run comprehensive supply-chain solutions.</p><h4>CAPACITY</h4><p>Currently, we operate around 11,000 trucks monthly, and there is plenty of room to increase this figure. In addition to that, I should stress that Aldia has a large storage capacity as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROWTH</h4><p>We are growing significantly and experiencing double-digit growth on a year-to-year basis. This is something that we are really satisfied with. We're seeing growth and we're feeling the economy's strength.</p><h4>FLOWER POWER</h4><p>As a whole, the flower business is relevant for UPS. We have 10 planes leaving from Bogotá to Miami every week, and most of the freight that they carry is flowers.</p><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><p>There's plenty of technology being created by UPS that we can make available to our customers. Some of them already work with us, so that's a segment that we think is going to drive growth in the next few years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ALL THE WAY</h4><p>In terms of imports, the US Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is expected to reduce the time that it takes for items to clear customs. In terms of exports, we are seeing a good opportunity for Colombia to enter a huge new market.</p><h4>CONNECTIONS</h4><p>DHL now has a very good direct connection to Venezuela and 24-hour transit time to Ecuador, Central America, and Miami. We are working to connect to New York in 24 hours.</p><h4>EXPECTATIONS</h4><p>In 2011, we transported 2.4 million shipments, and we expect to grow in 2013 by about 5%-7% in volume. We anticipate larger growth in terms of revenue, but in terms of volume we expect our shipment volumes to increased to 7%.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BREAK DOWN<br></h4><p>We can divide services in the sector into three main categories: mail, parcels, and money orders. The latter segment has been driving the growth of the sector over the last few years, and today it plays a very important role in the sector's development.</p><h4>COVERAGE</h4><p>We cover 98% of Colombia's territory, being the only sector with such a high level of geographic coverage at the national level. For example, all the associates together have an office network of more than 35,000 offices, meaning that our services are very efficient and effective.</p><h4>AFFILIATE</h4><p>At the moment, 14 out of the 21 companies are currently very active in the sector, and 13 of those companies are affiliated with us.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In Colombia, the strength is that we have over 100 species, and in each species there are many varieties. Colombia handles about 1,600 varieties, meaning that it is not one particular flower that is in demand, but the fact that we have many. That is very important because it allows us to build the bouquet industry, especially for supermarkets. Many of those bouquets are made here in Colombia, which means there is more value-added and labor. The entrepreneurship of our growers is a big distinction, along with the position we have built over in the US, which is our main market. About 80% of the volume of flowers that the US imports comes from Colombia. Our location and the quality of our flowers are the most important issues. The biggest challenge and the one we have been facing for a few years now is the appreciation of the peso. A weak dollar and a strong peso is very difficult, because in our cost component we have a high participation of labor, and with labor there is not much room for negotiation.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Today, the industry for coffee in coffee shops is very active in Colombia. We have excellent operators and competition, and we could say that our company created that quality. Before us, people tended to drink tinto, which is more or less like a cup of American coffee in the US. We aimed to create a friendly ambience in our store, and convince people to start trying cappuccinos, espressos, and different types of coffee. We tried to develop that culture in Colombia, offering coffee prepared in many different ways. A very important aspect of our company is that it has raised awareness about Colombia's many different coffee profiles. The coffee that you get from the Sierra Nevada is very different from that what is grown in Cauca or Huila. The reason for such a big difference is the various altitudes and latitudes in which coffee is grown in Colombia. Also, depending on the type of soil, very different coffee profiles can be achieved. We have four different regions represented year round in our stores.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The main challenge is to boost cocoa production at the national level. In fact, the Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development is targeting annual production figures of 200,000 tons as part of its 10-year plan. The government is using cocoa, among other products, to attract farmers who grow illicit drugs to change their crops. We have to bear in mind that climate conditions—humidity, soil, sea level, and altitude—in those areas where traditionally illicit crops have been very common are very suitable to grow cocoa. Colombia currently has 135,000 cocoa hectares, and we believe that we need to grow. CasaLuker is actively contributing to this strategy by implementing pilot projects across the country and by carrying out talks via provincial associations to explain the benefits of cultivating cocoa, as well as techniques to boost productivity, efficiency, and profitability preserving the quality. Technology and know-how transfer is very important, and the country should also invest in human capital because there is currently a lack of expertise in these areas.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our industry comes with many challenges, one of which is the growth of illicit trade. Regretfully, the legal market is shrinking while the illegal sector is growing month after month. In Colombia, around 14% of the sector is represented by the illegal trade, a phenomenon that has grown over the past few years. This challenge in itself is costing the country millions of dollars that would and should be invested in activities that contribute to the country's social development. There are a number of measures implemented by the local and regional governments against the illicit trade of tobacco, in which we have actively participated: we have been heavily involved in training the police and providing them with the information and skills required in order to identify contraband accurately. We are working closely with the National Trade Association on educational campaigns that are focused on shopkeepers, along with another strategies aimed at consumers. Every person plays a part in contributing to a culture of illegality within the country and this has to stop.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Colombia will be strong in biofuels, especially in its internal market. We have land restrictions at the moment preventing us from being a major player in terms of exports, but we will certainly be supporting biofuel developments to ensure sufficient consumption for domestic use, both for ethanol and biodiesel. The immediate step, however, is making sure the current usage policy remains at a 10% blend. We have the capacity and technology to raise that to 20%. Significant players are the US with 52 billion liters per year and Brazil with 23 billion liters per year. Colombia's production is very small compared to those markets. The first wave of biofuel projects, both in ethanol and biodiesel, were small- to medium-sized investments that were on plantations already in a steady state. In other words, they were not grassroots organizations because sugar or palm oil was already being produced there and the facilities were just expanded. Our project started from scratch and introduced sugarcane in a part of the country that never had it before. That takes a lot of patience, and it is higher risk because you are testing new land that is not accustomed to agriculture. However, if you are successful, it creates a win-win scenario for both country and company. We are bringing in new technology and introducing agriculture to an area that previously only stocked cattle.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The biofuels industry is six years' old and has been rapidly implemented. We had the raw materials to produce ethanol that is blended with gasoline, and palm oil to produce biodiesel that is blended with diesel oil. Today, we are blending 9% of biodiesel with the diesel and 8% of ethanol blended with the gasoline consumed in Colombia. This result was achieved after an investment of nearly $2 billion. We are now looking to increase our blending activity, supplying more or less 13% of ethanol in gasoline by the end of 2013 and 10% of biodiesel in diesel oil. This is part of the company's first stage. We are also looking to increase this figure to 15% in the year 2015 of both biofuels—ethanol in gasoline and biodiesel in diesel oil—and 20% by the year 2020. This is the future. We have invested $1.3 billion in planting palm oil plantations. We will need more—about $300 million more—to grow enough plants and meet our 2015 and 2020 targets. This applies to the biodiesel sector, which uses palm oil. In the case of ethanol, for the years 2015 and 2020, we need to invest more or less $1 billion.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The biofuel sector in Colombia began with a directive by the Colombian government; we have a decree that involves ethanol and biodiesel. We want to reach B-20 for biodiesel in 2020, and for ethanol it is more or less the same. We are not only thinking about first-generation biofuels, we are thinking about the second- and third-generation biofuels. Research carried out by EMPA a Swiss Institute in Colombia states that greenhouse gas reduction from bio-diesels was 83%, and for ethanol there was a 74% reduction as compared to fossil fuels. We were showing this data to environmental and energy commissions in the EU and to the EPA in the US to demonstrate that our biodiesel produced from palm oil is different from the biodiesel produced in Malaysia or Indonesia, where there are problems with deforestation. We have plenty of land that does not involve forests to produce biofuels; this is a good thing for us, because our idea is to be sustainable. We have enough land to increase the production to reach a 20% blend. We are now beginning to research how to produce energy from biomass. We have a great opportunity. I believe that we need to share knowledge with the US government. It is improving the technology to produce biofuels from biomass. If we have the biomass and they have the technology then it would be beneficial for both countries.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AFTER SALES<br></h4><p>We have been operating in Colombia since 1959, and we know consumers' needs in terms of after-sales services. Therefore, we do not hesitate when investing large amounts of money in our after-sales departments and services.</p><h4>PLANNED INVESTMENT</h4><p>Colombia has lower motorization levels than countries such as Peru and Chile, and that represents a unique opportunity. If the country materializes all the infrastructure projects and investments it plans, the industry could easily reach a sales figure of 450,000 units per year.</p><h4>GOOD RECORD</h4><p>We expect to close 2013 with something around 300,000 sales. Overall, I believe it will be another key year for the industry, which has enjoyed a couple of very good years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SALES AFFECTED</h4><p>We expect to improve our sales by around10% in a struggling market environment. However, our business is very affected by the Japanese yen, which had a strong impact in past years with its revaluation.</p><h4>NEW CARS</h4><p>In Colombia, car dealerships make most of their profits through new car sales. If you compare this with a typical car dealership in the US, they make most of their profit with used cars and after-sales.</p><h4>BETTER &amp; CLEANER<br></h4><p>The vision for the country's automotive business is that it still has a long way to go. Growth can be accomplished through better infrastructure and probably by measures that support and create incentives for cleaner technology.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LOCAL CONTENT<br></h4><p>Our cars are comprised of around 30%-32% local content. Our goal is to increase this to 60%-65%, to be in line with Mexico or Brazil. If the company wants to achieve this, it needs local suppliers to be more competitive.</p><h4>ISSUE OF COMPETITION</h4><p>Renault is in first place in terms of quality, cost, and productivity in the Americas, but we still need to improve the issues of competitiveness in local parts and logistics.</p><h4>A KEY SECTOR<br></h4><p>The authorities are open to negotiations, and they are working on a policy that will develop the automotive market. Our sector is extremely important for the Colombian government because we provide employment as well as technology. We are suppliers and dealers.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Growth will mainly stem from service providers. We have many projects and many different technologies being deployed in that area. Broadband penetration is still low, even though it is on par with the Latin American average. We expect the infrastructure from service providers to be largely rebuilt in the coming years, leading to a number of new broadband projects. Some of these initiatives have already been announced, such as ETB's fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) project. This is a challenging project that has been authorized and is estimated to cost around $500 million. The TV Azteca deployment of the national fiber-optics project is another project underway. In addition, Claro and Telefónica will need to upgrade their networks, and we expect investments there. UNE is investing heavily in cable, which is a new technology that allows customers to use internet at home at speeds of up to 100 MB per second. As part of a new project, this fairly good speed will be available for 700,000 houses over the next two years. There will also be significant investments in 40 tenders, which will attract a variety of new players.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The consumer and enterprise sectors have huge potential, as the market is bigger than the carriers. Our market share is still quite small in these areas, which is why we are going to focus on these two sectors in the future. The economy of Colombia is developing very fast, and this fosters ICT progress across different industries. After two years of promotion, we are very pleased to notice our ICT solutions and products have been widely accepted by different industries and institutes. Another sector of potential growth will be smart devices. Huawei thinks that the consumer market will develop rapidly as smart devices are more accepted by consumers. With broadband services improving, smart devices are becoming necessary in daily life. In 2013, we are going to launch more high-end smart devices in Colombia. We also have high expectations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We started our direct operations in Colombia in 1999-2000; therefore, we can talk about more than a decade of direct operations now ongoing in this country. Over the years, we have learned to focus on bringing our brand values to Colombian consumers, and we develop products aimed at tending to their specific needs. Also, we are constantly innovating and launching new products on the market. The Colombian market is an excellent testing ground for our products, because we have come to understand that the products that successfully make it in the Colombian market are also a success in other regional markets. LG heavily invests time and resources while carrying out precise market research that enables us to develop specific products for the very demanding consumers. Overall, I would say that Colombian consumers are savvy in terms of value and early adopters in terms of technology, which again makes the market a rigorous testing ground for products entering Latin America. We are very optimistic for the development of the country and our operations as well. We aim at maintaining our leading position in the electronics market in Colombia, and we also want to continue offering value propositions and products to our clients by offering better solutions and the most advanced technology.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>If you compare the square meter per person ratio in Colombia to other countries, there is an opportunity. There is space to build more shopping centers. However, if you compare that to the GDP per capita, it is different and it is probably not the opportunity that you might wish. We have around 15 shopping malls in Chile, Peru, and Colombia. We began operations in Colombia in 2008 with the shopping center in Pereira called Parque Arboleda. It was the first one, and we opened it to the public in November 2010. It has been operating for two years now and so far performed as we expected. However, we have an increasing number of competitors. I am confident in the stability of the country from a legal perspective and also the security and macroeconomic perspectives. GDP is growing at a sustainable rate and the GDP per capita is increasing as well. The middle class is growing, which in turn increases purchasing power. From a legal perspective, the opportunities and macroeconomics give me confidence. Colombia has three or four financial capitals and there are 10 cities with more than 500,000 people. If you have that amount of people, it is significant and there are opportunities. Additionally, there are other cities in Colombia between 250,000 and 500,000 people with no shopping malls. There is also another opportunity for a different kind of shopping center.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Shopping centers in Colombia are different from malls elsewhere; each store is owned by an investor that then rents the space to a brand. It is not individually owned as in many other countries such as the US. In Santafé Centro Comercial, we have around 400 owners that gather regularly, and then we have a board that is directly elected by them, who at the same time elects the manager of the mall. This is a non-profit organization in which all the actors have completely different targets, missions, and prospects. We do not seek profit, and revenues come mainly from two sources: a common administration fee that enables us to keep the building clean, secure, and upgraded, and a marketing contribution that everyone pays in order to promote the shopping center. In addition, we also sell advertisements in common areas in order to generate extra revenue. Therefore, economic revenue is not an issue at all for us. However, I can tell you that we are doing fine in terms of profit. We are trying to make Santafé Centro Comercial more accessible to people. We are working on a project on El Pobablo Avenue in Medellí­n to make it more accessible for cars. In addition, we created a free parking not long ago, which positively contributed to increase the overall number of visitors. In 2012, it was historical in terms of economic performance and sales.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The rapid growth and economic development of Colombia, along with the increasing levels of security, has contributed to bringing social and economic stability to the country. Such factors have generated a new business environment in Colombia that has both national and foreign investors very excited. We clearly feel such an environment. In addition, Colombia has started to show its real potential to the entire world. If we compare Colombia to a market such a Chile, we find that the former has three times the population, a wider network of large cities and towns (over 500,000 inhabitants) across the country, and a richer cultural diversity. The Colombian middle class is rapidly expanding, which also brings the incorporation of many SMEs into the formal business environment. Altogether, we talk about key factors for the development of our activity and the services Mall Plaza offers. We talk about the current and future attractiveness for investors. In terms of figures, between 15% and 20% of the retail and entertainment sales in the country take place in shopping malls, which means that there is room to keep growing the sector as society continues increasing its purchasing power. For example, in markets similar to Colombia, the figure I mentioned before stands at around 30%. Therefore, the sector offers huge opportunities, and from our company we aim to continue expanding our portfolio by grabbing some of these opportunities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>JOSÉ DAMIÁN SÁEZ MARTÍNEZ</h4><p>Traditionally, Colombia has developed infrastructure projects under a concession regime, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) follow this model. The only difference is the way concessions are structured, for PPPs are based on European models and standards. In this regard, I believe that PPPs are contributing to the development of large infrastructure projects, as well as the establishment of joint ventures between Colombian and foreign companies. However, we are still a bit early, because the final model has not been shaped yet and the attractiveness of infrastructure projects will depend on the distribution of the operating risks in each PPP and the return on investment. These factors were resolved between the third and final quarter of the year. In 2010, we started to repatriate Colombian engineers and technical workers spread all over the world and subsequently re-launched operations in the country. Currently, the company is strongly focusing its activities on oil and gas, which is our traditional sector and is gathering pace in Colombia.</p><h4>BERNARDO GAMBOA CASTILLA</h4><p>We are currently starting a project for Inví­as, with well-known Spanish company Sacyr as our joint venture partner. The government awarded 17 road construction projects at the beginning of 2012, and we were awarded one of the largest, which is a partial section of the road between Buenaventura and Buga. This road connects the largest port in the Pacific with the rest of the country through very well defined infrastructure. In mining, we are doing a lot of work with Cerrejón on the capacity expansion of its infrastructure to produce and export 40 million tons of coal per year. We do not want to overexpose ourselves, and know our size and limitations. However, some projects are getting too big for Colombian companies, which is another very important reason why we need partners that are adequate for the size of the project. The company's revenue in 2011 was $100 million. We expected to close with around $150 million in 2012. We are not the largest company, but we are very well respected and well positioned.</p><h4>JUAN RICARDO NOERO</h4><p>A project that we are working on that will boost Colombia's free trade is Canal de Varadero, which is a new access channel into Cartagena Bay. We are sponsoring this initiative in collaboration with the Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Cartagena (SPRC), which at a volume of 2.5 million TEUs annually, is Colombia's second largest container terminal after the port of Buenaventura in the Pacific. We are funding 50% of this initiative in partnership with SPRC, with the balance of the investment being funded by the national government. This will allow entry to container vessels carrying up to 12,000 TEUs to pass through to Cartagena. The Canal de Varadero is another project that we have been fostering and working on for over two years, and we are close to securing all of the necessary environmental permits. We estimate that the project will require a total investment of approximately $60 million, funded 50-50 via a public-private partnership (PPP).</p><h4>JUAN FRANCISCO CÁMARA GIL</h4><p>From my professional expertise, I think Colombia could do something similar to what Spain did many years ago; develop roadway corridors to facilitate road transportation between its different cities, as well as cleaning, sanitation, and water treatment projects. Colombia's main advantage is that about 70% of its energy is hydroelectric, which would be key in developing logistical centers in ports, for instance. That would be the next step for the country. I believe that Colombia has a great potential for railway projects, and although they could be expensive due to Colombia's geography, it would give a very important competitive advantage to the country. Also, I think there could be room to develop metro projects in cities like Bogotá, which currently lacks a metro or even a tram network. In this regard, we are holding talks with Vossloh AG, a German transport technology manufacturer, to come up with a project for Bogotá to implement a railway project that could be used, at the same time, for a metro or tram, and also for commuter or suburban trains.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The growth of FTZs in Colombia has been possible thanks to a change in the government's policies, as they became strategic and an essential part of a nationwide project to attract more FDI and strengthen national investment. In this regard, the bureaucratic processes for the establishment of FTZs were shortened and made easier, while setting the perfect regulatory and tax framework for their establishment in the regions of Colombia. Therefore, today we have permanent and special FTZs in Colombia in between 15 and 20 regions, which contributes to the development of these regions. Some changes in Law 105 brought income tax benefits of up to 15% for enterprises establishing operations in FTZs, as well as special customs tariff regimes. These areas are considered foreign production zones when it comes to customs tariffs for imports. Today, FTZs are large production areas with great logistics services. Zona Franca Parque Central has 116 hectares of FTZ planned, of which 64 have already been approved, while the remaining are part of our first expansion plan.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The law of 2005 gave an opportunity for companies to clarify how the FTZs would work and function. Until that time, our FTZs ran on World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations and requirements. The only FTZs that were available to develop in Colombia were the permanent FTZs, and special FTZs weren't allowed until that point. Not all of those 113 FTZs are operating yet, with 13 or 14 awaiting approval by the resolution of the Taxes and Customs National Bureau (DIAN). Of those FTZs, 36 are permanent FTZs, and the rest are Special FTZs. The factor that led to the boom was the government's enabling of the development of these Special FTZs. Special FTZs are very important because they have enabled certain projects to be done in the country, projects that would've been done elsewhere or a much smaller scale otherwise. They have created jobs, and brought in investment and new technologies. One example is the Cartagena Refinery. That particular project with the FTZ program became a huge investment of almost $5 billion thanks to the fact that it could be done in a Special FTZ.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are making an effort to attract more companies through the internet because the world is online. In order to plan our operations, we work to keep in touch with other companies online. The internet is very important to us, especially in terms of handling the way other regimes feel about monetary and customs facilities. The free zone received feedback from at least one important entity that was opposed to the way we were operating because we were totally tax exempt for the purposes of international trade. The International Commerce Association considered it illegal because it encouraged exports exclusively. The bill was amended recently, and since then we are taxed 15%, the same percentage that China enforces. This 15% is not designed to push exports forward, but is instead geared toward selling at a fairer price locally and abroad. Now, anything made at La Candelaria can be exported or sold in Colombia. La Candelaria and other free zones here in Cartagena and this region are additional areas for industrial and development purposes.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>FTZs were envisaged as industrial elements that would contribute to company product diversification and capacity expansion. At the same time, FTZs are a great source of new employment opportunities for regions that previously lacked labor opportunities. In this context, some FTZs attracted large amounts of investment and became major industrial hubs, such as Reficar, near the coast. Many companies strengthened their production facilities and capacities, while contributing to the development of certain regions in the country. In addition, these areas also provide competitive advantages to Colombia in such a global and competitive world, especially after the free trade agreements (FTAs) signed by the government recently. Some long-existing FTZs, like ours, which were established some 20 years ago, also received a boost, for they had become stagnant over the years, especially after the recession period in the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We believe that energy, infrastructure, and economic development are critically important for Colombia as the country continues progressing; therefore, we are sure that success will require depth in areas where GE is an expert that excels. Colombia is currently one of the most attractive countries in the region for investment. This is the result of continued policies to open doors to foreign investment and create legal stability and an attractive environment for FDI. Colombia has a little bit of everything. It is not an oil country, but it has oil. It is not a gold country, but it has gold. Colombia has very good agricultural products like coffee and flowers. It also has a strong industrial sector, even though more infrastructure development is necessary. The size of the country is also an advantage. Colombia is larger than most other countries in the region except for Brazil. However, it needs to be better at execution.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The first focus of our company was Brazil and Argentina, and due to the crisis in Argentina in 2001 we decided to consider other countries and possibilities. The first move outside these two countries was Chile, where we bought a local company. During President Uribe's administration, we experienced a different business environment in Colombia. The fundamentals of the economy today are good, and you can see that inflation, interest, and economic growth are stable. It is not difficult to find good human resources here, and today in countries like Brazil a qualified workforce can be difficult to encounter. In 2010, Schneider Electric, along with Alstom, decided to buy Areva, which was a big player in the worldwide transmission and distribution industry. We then split the company into two parts. The distribution side was bought by Schneider, while the transmission segment went to Alstom. Areva had one plant in Colombia, which we incorporated into our organization. Colombia offers great opportunities to consumers and the industry.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Colombia is important; it is turning into the third largest economy in the region. It is also the third most populated country in the region after Brazil and Mexico, which represent DuPont's largest operations in Latin America. However, Colombia is also very significant. We're getting a lot of support from the corporation to identify the needs of the market and how DuPont can be part of that growth in this environment. Colombia is very active in energy—oil and gas in particular—and DuPont has a strong portfolio in that area. Infrastructure is another area where we are working very hard here in Colombia, providing new roads that the country needs. And now we're signing agreements and we have technology that can improve and enhance paving. We're present in one of the most important projects, the Ruta del Sol II, which is 528 kilometers in length and incorporates DuPont paving technology. We are also planning to be part of other projects in Colombia. Agriculture and nutrition are other areas we are interested in.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We have been in the business for 26 years. Since that time, things have changed dramatically. We have experienced booming years such as what we have seen recently, but we have had difficult periods as well. The Colombian business community is not large enough to specialize in a particular area, but we accumulated very significant experience in sectors like energy. For almost eight years, we were very successful in the consolidation of the supermarket retail business. We bought for a client of our firm a minority position of Carulla, which was then the second largest retail chain in Colombia. In seven years, we were able to make a dozen acquisitions that along with internal growth allowed this company to multiply its sales six fold. For every peso that it sold when we started, it sold six by the time of completion. Its synergies and economies of scale were tremendous, and it was a very successful operation. We sold it for $770 million to Grupo Éxito, which comprised the largest retail chain in Colombia by far.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>There is both a great need for investment in infrastructure in the country and a lot of institutional savings. Institutional savings were growing rapidly and were not connected to infrastructure, and so we saw that we could be a vehicle to connect the two things. We thus decided to launch an infrastructure fund in Colombia, using Ashmore's well-known best practices and our knowledge of the country. We decided to launch the fund, and in the middle of the process the Colombian government decided it would like to inject some capital in a fund to invest in the country. It hired and retained the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and the Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF) to choose a fund manager that would handle, among others, the money of the Colombian government. Initially, the government committed to contributing $125 million, but then, when the crisis of 2008 struck, it contributed $40 million. For 20 or 30 years, Colombia was highly unattractive because of violence and drugs. The economy was closed off, but all that has changed.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The sector has mostly focused its activities on Bogotá and a few other cities, a trend that started to change some four or five years ago. Today around 97% of Colombia's towns have, at least, minimum banking activity, and banking penetration rates have increased up to 65% of the adult population. In this regard, we are on the right track to improving the sector's performance, although I believe there are still many things to be done. The government of Colombia has implemented several strategies that have positively contributed to increase banking penetration and activity rates across the country. For example, it has authorized the establishment of non-banking correspondents, and today there are as many as 26,000. This has helped to bring banking activities to more than 350 Colombian towns that before did not have any kind of banking activity.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In terms of strengths, the economy has good organization and capitalization of the financial sector. The horrors of the mortgage crisis are behind us. Also, the professionalism of the Ministry of Finance and the Banco de la República has permitted us to cope with huge turbulence abroad, so we do not foresee risks of fiscal and financial tension. In terms of weaknesses, security and drug trafficking threats are still the big factors. Colombia's Achilles' heel is the shortage of infrastructure to deal with those threats. If Colombia doesn't take advantage of this recent boom in commodity exports like coal, oil, and gold, and make investments to improve security and fight drug trafficking, then it will unfortunately not be able to jump into the 6% growth range. Measured in medium-term growth averages, Colombia has grown about 4.4% on average every five years. If you look at it by decades, Colombia has averaged an annual growth rate of between 3.8% and 4.5%. However, the aim of growing at a 6% annual basis still eludes us.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Bancamí­a was established four years ago, and over this time we have achieved a greater affinity in attending the services of the population with lower incomes. The company has grown from working in nine departments to having operations in 32 of the country's departments; in other words, we have reached around 72% of Colombia's municipalities. In addition, we are reaching the poorest communities in the country; 62% of the poor population lives in the countryside and they are very much dependent on the agriculture sector. Bancamí­a is a social institution committed to contributing to the economic and social development of Colombians. For example, 21% of our customer portfolio is linked to the countryside and the agriculture sector. Also, we have formalized and raised awareness of the micro-financing sector in Colombia. Bancamí­a was the first financial institution specialized in micro financing in the country and today, 99% of our clients are micro enterprises.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We need to work on achieving greater penetration in the sector; currently the penetration rate stands at 65% in general. However, if we look closer at the agriculture sector in particular, we will see that only 20% of current agriculture GDP (6%) uses financing tools from the banking sector, whereas around 50% of the population is dependent on the agriculture sector. In regards to this, the Ministry of Agriculture is implementing several projects to achieve a greater level of financial inclusion in the agriculture sector, and the government is also doing something at the social level nationwide to overcome poverty levels and further increase the depth of the finance sector. In addition, our bank has the responsibility to pay a social subsidy to as many as 1.7 million families in the country. It is something similar to what Brazil did a few years ago.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been promoting the benefits of trade and business for 30 years. We have seen an increase in trade between the two countries over the last six or seven years, and a lot of companies from the finance, environment, security, and high-tech sectors have come knocking on our door. We have been introduced to most Colombian companies, and most of them have stayed. Oil and gas, as well as coal mining are also very important sectors. There has been a lot of interest from British companies supporting the oil and gas sector, including equipment, machinery, and tool manufacturers, and there are also two important laboratories here, including AstraZeneca, importing vaccines and medications for patients with cancer and HIV. In terms of exports, oil, gas, and coal dominate, and in non-traditional products there are fruits, exotic fruits, bananas, coffee, flowers, and palm oil, which is important in the UK market. We are trying to duplicate in the next few years the volume of commerce between the UK and Colombia.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are groups from the US  that have come to Colombia to take advantage of the free trade agreement (FTA)—selling US products, finding partners, and buying Colombian products. The main sectors of interest are the extraction industry and related services, as well as the agricultural and food production industry. There is also a third area, which is the participation of US enterprises in bidding on infrastructure projects that this country has to develop. One of the main challenges for the Colombian government is to develop and supply the country with much-needed and large infrastructure projects. This is related mainly to roads, railroads, ports, and airports. In the past, foreign companies, except enterprises from the US, tended those projects. Considering the companies that have participated in the building and administration of large projects, it was mostly European companies—Spanish, Italian, German, Finnish—carrying out the work, and we saw very few US companies active in the country.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the last two years, the goal has been to reposition Cali and Valle del Cauca as a destination for multinationals. Cali was, for a long time, the place where multinationals arrived in Colombia. People arrived for different reasons. The Buenaventura port was nearby, which was not so much for exporting because it was a closed economy but more for importing goods. This proximity to the port and the closeness to the Pacific was key. Another reason multinationals established operations in Cali was that there was a train that passed through Cali, and thirdly because there was already very strong local industrial development. If you compare Cali to Barranquilla, Medellí­n, and Bogotá, Cali is the youngest city of them all. In the 1920s, nobody knew Cali. It was Barranquilla, Medellí­n, and Bogotá that were the really important cities. Then, local industrialization attracted multinationals closer to the Pacific.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Colombia is a leading country in Latin America, and although it has considerably grown and evolved in the last decade, especially in terms of security, there is still much to be done. I personally believe that Colombia offers plenty of opportunities for Spanish companies that seek alternative markets outside of Europe. In addition, Colombia's legal framework is very favorable for foreign investors, and both countries have signed important trade and legal agreements to boost Spanish investments. Legal security is one of the most important advantages of Colombia as an investment destination, as the World Bank recognized in one of its last reports. Furthermore, Colombia's geostrategic location allows investors to easily enter other neighboring and regional markets and take advantage of several trade agreements Colombia has signed with countries like the US and Canada. Colombia has created a very favorable legal framework for foreign investors, because they see the arrival of FDI as a way of creating more jobs and reducing social and economic differences in society.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Colombian banking sector has barely been affected by the economic and financial crisis in Europe. Colombia learned a lot from the financial crisis that affected the country at the end of the 1990s and strengthened the regulatory and supervisory framework of the sector. This clearly contributed to shielding the national economy in general, and the banking system in particular, before potential external threats. Additionally, when the crisis hit those markets, Colombia barely had relations with them, and as a consequence the country has not felt an economic contraction. A great deal of Colombia's economic development is linked to its self-development, because the country is growing in terms of infrastructure and industrial production. Slower domestic economic growth and lower commodity prices have been the main economic worry the country has had. For example, we expected the economy to grow about 5% in 2012, and now we believe that figure will be around 4.1%.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Banco Pichincha made its incursion into the Colombian financial and banking sector coincidentally when Colombia was badly affected by the economic crisis of the 1990s. Obviously, those were tough times, and I have to say that banking supervision got stronger and many regulatory measures were adopted at the time, which clearly contributed to making the Colombian banking system very solvent. This helped to face the eurozone crisis, and, overall, I would say that the Colombian banking system is better positioned than other economic sectors in the country to take on any challenge coming from abroad. Since the company was a commercial finance company for almost 15 years, we inherited its products portfolio, and we called these financial services “specialized products;“ credit lines for higher education students, the acquisition of both public and private vehicles, revocable insurance premiums, and so on. As a bank we broadened and diversified our products portfolio by incorporating retail banking, SMEs, and corporate banking services.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Colombia has many interesting aspects that appeal to our company. First of all, it has a much larger population, with 46 million people against the 17 million living in Chile. However, the penetration of banking products for the population is low in Colombia compared to Chile. In terms of total loan-to-product, Colombia has 30%, while Chile has 70%. If you compare that to countries like the US or Europe, Colombia's ratio is very low. There is a lot of potential to grow. There is political and economic stability here and there is a good financial system with very clear rules for foreign investors. Those factors were very important for us. There are also interesting industries and projects, particularly in infrastructure, which is one of our focus areas in Colombia. We want to be a good player to finance all of those projects.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Colombia is a very important market for MasterCard for many reasons. To start, its sheer size, growing youthful population, and dynamic economy are factors that are making the country a significant contributor to our performance in our Latin America operations. It's safe to say it is one of the countries with the highest potential in the region as Colombia provides us with a huge opportunity to penetrate the electronic payments landscape, due to the currently low penetration of electronic payments as a percentage of the personal consumption expenditure (PCE). Currently, the penetration of electronic payments in Colombia is around 9.8% of PCE. So, there is a potential to begin migrating the nearly 90%, of transactions that are still done with cash and checks. This makes Colombia ripe for growth in terms of the penetration and development of electronic payments, as well as the opportunity to develop strong relationships with our customers, who we consider our partners in the market.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROWN &amp; ACHIEVED</h4><p>Colfondos is a pension fund management company that has been operating in the Colombian market for more than 20 years now, a period of time in which we have grown and achieved many important things.</p><h4>THE NEED FOR REFORM</h4><p>The country is aware of the need to carry out a national labor reform in order to improve the coverage of the pension system; in Colombia, only 15% of people who save money in the public systems manage to get a pension afterward.</p><h4>READY TO SUPPORT</h4><p>We are ready to support the government in important and ambitious plans, specifically in highway network infrastructure. We would like to set up a transparent process to know about all the risks involved in the plans, and it would be very important for us to make direct investments in such projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LONG TIME COMING</h4><p>For a long time now, we have been talking about alternative ways of investing money in Colombia, such as infrastructure projects. We truly believe that the pension funds are perfect tools to invest in this type of project.<br></p><h4><br>BALANCED, NOT RISKY</h4><p>Global and domestic circumstances impact the entire system, and we must diversify our pension system through less risky returns while seeking assets that will balance the level of rates.</p><h4><br>POWER TO THE PEOPLE</h4><p>One of our top priorities is to strengthen the individual savings scheme. At the moment, the Labor Minister is drafting a reform of the pension funds system that aims at increasing the coverage of the system, which is a priority for all players involved in the system.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BEING THE BEST</h4><p>We can attribute our success to our consistency. We are very focused on a specific market niche and we tend to personalize our advice and work toward being the best in terms of returns and performance.</p><h4>BENEFITS ALL AROUND</h4><p>The industry has been evolving positively. This has led to a beneficial trickle-down effect, not only for the Colombian people but also for the country. In parallel, the fiscal deficit of the country has decreased.</p><h4>THE RIGHT EMPHASIS</h4><p>Colombia is a highly regulated country, but the authorities are doing their job very well. Business is transforming and becoming more transparent. A lot of emphasis has been put on corporate governance, and we, as a multinational corporation, are used to that.<span></span></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>STEADY AS SHE GOES<br></h4><p>Protección has had very steady growth since the reform of the pension system in Colombia. By the end of 2012, we were considered the leading company within the pension funds industry in the country.</p><h4>MARKET PARTICIPATION</h4><p>Protección has positively contributed to the development of the country and its saving systems, extending the trend to our customers, their employees, and our affiliates. Many companies have also benefited from our participation in the capital markets.</p><h4>ONLY THE BEGINNING</h4><p>Once we create a savings culture in Colombia and the multi-funds system continues to develop, the fund industry will continue maturing. The best years are yet to come.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Due to changes in the technology for heat exchangers in cars, as a pioneer in this industry we started new production lines that utilized aluminum; this means cheaper and more efficient products with more satisfied customers. Other producers followed us, and now there is no car manufacturer using copper or brass products. In the industrial heat exchangers section, many companies used to import their needs, while over the past 10 years we have met all of our own demand. Our customer list is a long one. We supply to almost all automotive manufacturers in Iran, with a focus on passenger cars. We supply 100% of Saipa's demand and 60% of Iran Khodro's. We guarantee our products for two years, but in normal usage radiators need to be changed every 12 years. The radiator is the first part to be damaged in every car crash, and it should be replaced. We supply radiators for many kinds of vehicles in Iran. We have about 450 employees at our two plants, which are very close to each other. We are planning to establish a plant outside of Iran as well, and we are focusing on Russia and Ukraine as potentially big markets where we can easily meet radiator demand.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Iran Yasa is the largest tire producer in Iran. The founder of this factory chose the best technology available at the time the company started. The company received the technology from Japanese manufacturers that were present at that time. The machines were imported from Japan and the technology was based on a combination of Iranian and foreign concepts. The base was very good, and afterward the technology department of the factory started to make modifications—testing, innovating, and receiving feedback from the market, and correcting any defects. This strong base created loyalty among our customers and made quality a key factor for the success of the management of the company. The reforms we implemented at the company resulted in the large number of exports we delivered in 2011. Now that we are meeting the needs of the local market, it is our aim to look to foreign markets as well. We also made some changes in the distribution system of the factory, resulting in a number of benefits for the company. One is that we started to receive payments directly from end users, and another is that we now have a marketing department. We established the marketing department and receive feedback from the local market. The company also sent experts abroad to Nigeria, Iraq, and Turkmenistan to see what exactly what is in demand.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been successful in the air conditioning and cooling industry for a few reasons. First and foremost, we choose the right materials to produce with. Before 2000, when ISI was established, Iran Khodro used to buy its components from Sanden in Japan. It was paying double what it is paying now due to import tariffs. When we entered the market, Iran Khodro started buying from ISI because we offer the same components at one-third of the price. We bring in a lot of new technology through foreign partnerships, which I believe is good for the country. Technology is the second key to our success. Our products are made by Iranians, for Iranians. ISI has also created many job opportunities in the country. We are here to act as mediators and our foreign partners are really satisfied with us and very happy to invest in the country. Iran has a population of nearly 80 million people and 70% of the population is under the age of 30. A young country demands automobiles, so it is a huge market. We spend 30% of our budget on training and R&amp;D as we are committed to bringing the latest technology and standards to the country. The quality of our compressors is very high—they are unrivalled in the region. ISI strives to keep up with the latest compressor technology, as it is at the heart of ISI's air-conditioning systems.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I cover Unilever's operations from Kazakhstan to Cyprus, and Iran joined this group in 2007. This is a rather complicated geography and each country has its own difficulties. That is why we aim to truly understand how to operate in each country. We can be flexible as long as Unilever's Code of Business Principles is strictly adhered to. It is a rewarding challenge to understand the country, the consumers, and how the market operates. I travelled throughout the country several times to better understand local consumers, their shopping habits, and the trade structure. This contributed significantly to our plans, which turned the business around to deliver profitable and sustainable growth since 2009. The Iranian consumer is very conscious of the price-quality relationship, and they are ready to pay more for higher quality goods. Something produced abroad cannot simply be sold at any price—you have to deliver the right quality consistently. Iran has a very experienced and competitive industry in consumer goods. I can quantify the improvement in quality and the marketing skills of local businesses over the past five years. The quality of packaging has also become world class compared to other Central Asian states. Iran has a long history of trade and industry, and competition is welcomed and even encouraged. I believe the presence of multinationals not only accelerates market growth, but also the development of the local competition.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Danone has been looking at Iran since 2005 or 2006. Eventually, Danone struck a deal with a local partner with whom it set up a joint venture in August 2008. Basically, the facilities were already there, as the partner had already built the factory in Mashhad a couple of years earlier. Around that time, it started its own business producing milk powder for infants and adults. Various companies began looking at this plant in order to enter the Iranian market because of the country's high population, which sees the birth of around 1.5 million babies every year. It is one of the most populous countries in the region, and so there was a real long-term strategic intent from the side of Danone to make an entry into this market. There are actually four Danone divisions here in Iran, including water, dairy, and medical nutrition. Danone signed the deal in August 2008 with the local partner, forming the new company called Nutricia-MMP. MMP stands for Mashhad Milk Powder Industry. Its first product was launched in April 2009, while the long-term goal is to achieve profitability through targeted investment. We are marketing two global Danone brands here: Bebelac and Aptamil.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The relationship between Hayat Holding and Iran started many years ago. One of the holding group companies, Kastamonu Integrated Wood Industries, has exported its products to Iran for around 15 years. Kastamonu Integrated is the leader of the sector in Turkey, and a well-known brand in Iran as well. After these positive relationships were formed, the idea of investing in Iran was considered seriously. There have also been cultural connections between Iran and Turkey for many years. Iran has a consistent and stable management with a population close to 75 million and high potential. There is a visa exemption between the two countries and this provides a cross trade which has increased every single day. We believe in Iran, as the country provides a host of conveniences in terms of logistics. A larger investment in Iran will develop the relationship between the two countries further, and the people of both nations will continue to become closer.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Iran is an important country for Bühler because of its demographic and geographic position. Iran's population is currently approaching around 80 million. This is a huge market with huge potential for food production. Bühler's strategy is to remain active in this market and to serve its customers under any circumstances. We have been in this market for over 40 years as the fully owned subsidiary of Bühler AG of Switzerland. Our operation here is responsible for over 70% of total flour production in Iran, with 120 active mills. In 1996, Bühler invested in a production facility in Astara and currently our factory is providing the needed cleaning and logistical machines of the local milling industry. Today, we proudly label the products from our factory “Bühler Astara-Made in Iran.“ These products have become the first-class standard of the industry in Iran. In addition, Bühler is very active in the pasta business—over 60% of Iran's pasta is produced using Bühler machines—80% of the country's chocolate production, and 40% of the animal feed is produced using Bühler machines as well. Our initiative in Iran at the moment is rice milling with the inauguration of the biggest parboiling rice mill in the Middle East in Mazandaran province, and optical sorting by introducing our Sortex technology into the pistachio and wheat-cleaning markets.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The original joint venture between the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran and Sasol of South Africa was formed in 2002. The investment decision was taken in 2003, and ethylene production started in 2007, followed by polyethylene soon after in 2008. There are significant synergies gained by being in the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ), the most significant being the shared process utilities ASPC receives from Mobin. The site is very well integrated with pipeline interconnections on feedstock and product lines, and these enable greater production flexibility between the various petrochemicals businesses during production and feed upsets. There is a common spirit of goodwill among the producers in the PSEEZ to ensure we all succeed. The PSEEZ, together with Pazargad HSE, provides common emergency response services, roads, and other infrastructure, all of which benefits the individual and independent companies that operate within the zone.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Arya Sasol Polymer Company (ASPC) is primarily a polymer-producing company that has an excess of ethylene produced as feedstock for the process that we export. Arya Sasol's production assets are world class, and at the time of investment it had the latest in technology and consisted of an ethylene cracker and two polyethylene production plants. The original scope of the investment was to have included three polymer plants and one ethylene cracker, but the investment in the third polymer plant is yet to be approved, and as a result ASPC generates an excess of ethylene, which is currently exported. The original joint venture between the National Petrochemical Company (NPC) of Iran and Sasol of South Africa was formed in 2002. The investment decision was taken in 2003, and ethylene production started in 2007, followed by polyethylene soon after in 2008. There are some 800 permanent staff and a further 500 contractors working for Arya Sasol, making us a significant employer. There is a government initiative to maximize employment from local areas, which Arya Sasol supports fully.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Compared to other big players, LALEH produces only about 300,000 tons of petrochemicals annually. All things considered, we have to admit we are at a lower level. LALEH's production is limited to low-density polyethylene, whereas the other big players produce high-density polyethylene, linear low-density polypropylene, and methanol. The company has a specialized market share and customer base. Our products meet the quality standards for Europe, China, and India. Licensing provides the necessary standards for our products and what we produce. We have a complete set of all of the necessary equipment in our labs, and we calibrate this equipment at regular intervals. On the other hand, our customers' feedback is also crucial. We are in the process of rebuilding our factory in order to improve our plant's quality and capacity. The production rate for the first year was 160,000 tons after recovery, then 250,000 in the second year, and 272,000 tons for the last year. The company's target is 300,000 tons capacity, which is what the plant was designed to handle.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We began operations at the plant while producing at about 43% of our installed capacity. Now we produce at about 50%. But, during this period, there were a few days when we had feedstock for our production and could produce at levels very close to our designed capacity. Our people are skilled and experienced enough to operate the plant at the installed capacity, which is 300,000 tons per year. We also have different grades of homopolymer, copolymer, and terpolymer. Since we started, we have produced different grades of polypropylene, but we started with general grades and only later began to produce special variants that are more difficult to produce, such as Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene (BOPP), which is very sensitive to the production parameters of a plant. This means that the process must be kept under very careful watch. I am sure that many polypropylene (PP) producers in Iran are reluctant to produce the BOPP grade since we have the largest market share.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We want to be one of the main producers of urea, and we have built the foundations to achieve that status. At present, we are Iran's largest ammonia exporter. In addition, we can transform the ammonia product into urea. All of the fundamental infrastructure needed to do this in terms of electricity and water has been established. Since everything is already here, our next target is to install a 1 million-ton urea plant. This will be a big project for Razi, because it will almost double our production of urea. We plan to have this unit up and running in the next four years, and the investment will total more than ‚¬250 million or ‚¬300 million. Meanwhile, we are the only major producer of phosphate in Iran. To maintain our status in the market, we are going to establish a new facility to produce phosphate fertilizer. The main strategy is to produce fertilizer for domestic needs first and then for exports. Iran's location adjacent to the Persian Gulf means we have all the facilities necessary to export, and this is the main purpose behind our expansion plans.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our strategy is to grow our core businesses, such as iron ore, coal, copper, nickel, and fertilizers. With regards to coal, Mozambique is our biggest operation and it's a very important project for us. On that account, we are happy to be celebrating one year since our first production. Besides some difficulties with the country's infrastructure, we are happy because we are succeeding. The issues regarding a greenfield project like this are challenging, but the environment in Mozambique is very positive, and the government and society welcomes us. Mozambique was our first foray into Africa. The Inco acquisition was a landmark in Vale's international growth, and since 2007 and 2008 we have started to invest here, and it has been a good learning process. It's amazing how we are progressing. It is encouraging not only for us, but for other companies to invest in the region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>It's important to recognize that while you may have 10,000 people on-site during construction, it takes far fewer to efficiently run an LNG plant. Over time, as a trained workforce is developed, it is our expectation that more and more of these positions will be filled by Mozambicans. The vast majority of job creation generally occurs through indirect or induced employment opportunities. As part of our LNG project management, we will work to ensure that our contractor establishes training programs to provide basic skill sets and looks to employ as many Mozambicans as possible during construction and production. We are also actively recruiting a number of Mozambican engineers and technicians that we can take to the US for two or three years to work in facilities for on-the-job training in offshore environments and gas plants—the idea being that they will come back and ultimately end up as supervisors.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Since we re-launched operations here in 2006, Odebrecht has prioritized Mozambique. Odebrecht has been here for six years now, and it has been involved in the one of the most important projects—the Moatize Coal Project with Vale—with works developed in Moatize and Beira. The opportunity to develop other projects, such as logistics for the mining and oil and gas sectors as well as in the agribusiness and energy sector, makes Mozambique extremely important for our strategic growth in Africa for the next few years. One of the main principles of our philosophy is decentralization. We utilize delegation for making decisions in terms of developing the market. Local presence and empowerment to decision makers here makes a big difference.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Mozambique is very important to us. In Africa, Galp is present in all official Portuguese-speaking countries and in some others. Mozambique is as important as Angola on the Atlantic coast. The country is strategic in the Indian Ocean, not only for its 23 million inhabitants and about 2,500 kilometers of coastline, but also because of its strategic location, being surrounded by other major markets that is a meaningful expression. Galp is currently undertaking the distribution of lubricants in Malawi and fuels, LPG and lubricants in Swaziland, where we are currently the market leaders. We are in the lower-income market now and are planning to keep the distribution of oil. Petrogal is also attentive to the inland countries for which Mozambique is a natural supplier, becoming so strategically important in the region.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>When we first entered Mozambique 10 years ago, our business was difficult. At first, revenues were fairly low, reaching no more than $2 million annually. In the beginning, there were the state-owned operators such as TDM, but the problem public operators faced was even lower annual investment. Another reason the market was difficult was that Mcel and Vodacom had closed themselves to Chinese vendors. It took a long time for Huawei to convince the market that it is a reliable partner. Fortunately, the situation has changed for the better because Huawei formed a partnership with Vodafone and then Vodacom. Entering a new market takes time and investors have to be patient. It is important to evaluate the market's potential, in the short and long term.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In an emerging economy, every sector is important. Agriculture is a sector we have to take into consideration, as 80% of the population lives in rural areas. The industrial sector is also very important, due, in part, to the Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries' proximity. There is also potential for tourism in this country, as it has an incredible 2,500 kilometers of coastline. The tourism opportunities are fantastic, as are those in communications, transport, and infrastructure. In the financial sector, insurance companies are attractive as part of the emerging global economy. There is an amazing opportunity for investment in this country. The global financial crisis has been positive for Mozambique because people are looking for new and alternative ways to invest. The SADC is a region with 300 million consumers, so nothing happens in this country that isn't related to the SADC. One of the main sectors of the economy is agribusiness. Considering our neighboring countries, many investors are making inquires about potential customers, products, and sales. I always suggest that they must view this country as a platform with 23 million people from where they can produce and work with the surrounding markets.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have to be extremely careful in terms of the effect of high-profile investments and the natural resources that have recently been discovered, such as gas, coal, and maybe oil in the near future. If our currency becomes too strong, it will become non-competitive for traditional export products such as sugar, tobacco, cotton, and wood. It could eliminate the agricultural sector, for example, and we may hurt the tourism sector as well. I am a bit skeptical on how this will evolve, but I am positive that the Bank of Mozambique and the IMF will regulate together in order to make sure the traditional sectors are not neglected. This is very important, as more jobs are created via the more traditional sectors. In addition to Chinese and Brazilian investors, we have seen a lot of US investors in 2012. We believe there are going to be substantial US investments coming online as well as German investments. I also believe that Middle Eastern investors are starting to look at Mozambique, and they have some delegations that are coming here and will have meetings with senior local representatives. US investor interest is generally oil and gas related, but they also come here to look at the agricultural sector as well.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Mining is very important, though I also foresee a lot growth in agriculture, agribusiness, transport, communications, and electricity generation and distribution. The primary sector in extractive industries and investments in gas and power will lead the growth ladder in the medium term, while the requirement to build infrastructure is another turning point. Non-concessional loans have been capped at $1.5 billion for government projects, though it was previously limited to $900 million. While this is true in the capital-intensive sector, the country is bound to witness greater developments in the construction, logistics and transport, hospitality, industry, and agribusiness sectors, following new trade orientation to serve the needs of other emerging countries for coal, gas, and raw materials. We do not have a strong stock market here, but the only bank that fully operates in the stock market is Millennium bim. If we stopped operations, there would likely be no stock market. We are not listed on the local stock exchange, although we are listed in Europe. Investment in Mozambique mostly comes through government bonds and bonds issued by the Bank of Mozambique, although the environment for corporate bonds is also good.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Huawei is the only equipment supplier for Vodacom Mozambique's 2G and 3G radio access network, providing the SingleRAN solution, which is LTE ready. The third license operator, Movitel, has not only adopted Huawei SingleRAN equipment on the radio access network, where we enjoy a 50% market share, but also applied a converged billing system. Even though the operators have not embraced cloud-computing technology yet, we have already managed to team up with the government to establish a 2,000-sqm data center. This data center will cater to the needs of IT service companies in the various arms of government. Apart from that, the other 50% of its capacity will be dedicated to business sectors such as the commercial banking industry, mining, and hospitals, with data hosting and cloud-computing-based IT services. Currently, the technical trend is toward cloud-based networking. Intelligent Cloud, golden pipelines, and smart terminals are the three parts we identified as the components of our strategy.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are currently working on getting all of the corporations connected to a reliable network. The next step for us would be to introduce cloud services; connectivity is an enabler for the cloud. We have been talking to Associação de Comércio e Indústria (ACIS). We want to see if it is possible to launch software as a service, because traditional proprietary products are expensive and cumbersome for SMEs. I'm also looking at something on the Google platform that we might use. Right now, small businesses need to buy expensive proprietary software; they store it in their PC and then if there's a flood or an electrical spark, it's gone. That sort of thing happens all the time and it is a huge problem, but there are solutions out there; we just need to make them work for Mozambique. The incubator might be a route toward that as well. It could wind up being something we excel at as a service.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The idea of a Science and Technology Park is part of our ICT strategy and also our global development objective. The Science and Technology Park has three focus areas. One is education. The park will develop several educational activities, while also working as a technology incubator to help entrepreneurs, which is its second focus. We will link these educational activities to the incubator so that everybody has the chance to come up with new ideas. The final objective is to attract domestic and international companies that can invest and make a significant contribution to the park's development. The country itself is becoming an attractive place to do business, and we believe that this park will help foster closer relations between research and education. The companies that come here will have an opportunity to be very close to academic and research institutions, and will be able to utilize these research stations to develop new products and human resources. Infrastructure is one of the major attractions.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Most of the SMEs that are growing use either external solutions or very basic solutions. The price of the internet in Mozambique is also a barrier, but it must be seen not as a cost but as an investment. The whole country needs to invest in more reliable infrastructure. From the corporate side, the companies that really want to go further and take the next step in their business will have to invest in better connections and internal infrastructure. Also, there is no content in Mozambique; there is an opportunity there. Today, if we look at internet traffic, all of the incoming traffic originated externally. There is a lot of traffic, and it is growing fast each quarter. One of the opportunities is the creation of local content. Additionally, I expect that corporate customers will start growing very fast and will be an important part of the revenue stream for all players in this industry. Today, there is no big difference between the offer for residential customers and large companies, but TVCABO is working on a well-oriented project for companies of all sizes and address the specific issues of each sector.</p>]]></sections31>

We want to offer connectivity and recommend local banks, legal and accounting practices, advertising agencies, and all of the necessities that doing business requires.</p><h4>DAVID LAW</h4><h4>SELF-RELIANT</h4><p>Over the years, we have had to develop a capacity to do everything ourselves.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong>This is a very lively and rapidly developing market at the moment, with international hotel chains investing in it and great potential in the short to medium term. Such a trend also attracts many foreign companies from the tourist sector, as well as other fields of the economy. Along with luxury tourism, Azerbaijan is experiencing very important growth in the business segment, which is also fueled by four- and five-star hotels, facilities that are playing a significant role in the development of the sector. Business tourists tend to select short-term accommodation, emphasizing location. C Hotels sees this need and we are implementing strategies to take the leading role in the sector. Baku is implementing many different large-scale projects that will make the city even more beautiful to the eyes of tourists visiting it, including new parks, shopping malls, boutiques, corniches, entertainment venues, luxury hotels, restaurants, cafés, and much more. Such factors are important in the race to build a city brand. It is vital to keep promoting the city through brochures, billboards, music and promotional films, marketing campaigns, and other means such as international exhibitions, fairs, and events like the European Olympic Games in 2015.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>From day one, we always believed as a company that it is the quality of the guest experience that we provide that differentiates us from our competition, not just in Baku, but wherever we are. It is all about the people of Four Seasons, how they present themselves, and how they are so passionate about the service and the guests' experience. We make sure that we take maximum care of our guests and always make them feel special and acknowledged when needed. We look after the small details and go the extra mile to make the guests' stay memorable. The most important point is the constant desire to improve our involvement in the clients' experience. We are always trying to be a better element in our customers' experience. We are here to bring the true Four Seasons experience to the guests of Baku and Azerbaijan. The best value and the most exceptional experience that any Four Seasons around the world is providing to its guests, we are providing here and more. We have a great number of elements that support us to succeed in our mission. If you look at the hotel—the building itself—it is second to none. Internally and externally, this is one of the very best hotels I have ever seen in my life. The location is prime, with customers very close to the business center, overlooking the beautiful Caspian Sea, and the backyard of the amazing old city of Baku, and our big strategic partners are just across the street from the hotel.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>There are too many hotel rooms for the market, and this has a negative effect on occupancy rates. I have rarely been to a city in the world where the inventory of five-star hotel rooms moves from 400 rooms to 1,300 rooms in the space of such a short time. It is very hard for a city to absorb this kind of inventory increase. Lately, we have been receiving a lot of MICE visitors, and not so many traditional tourists. I think that until 2014 we will have a fairly quiet time in the hotel industry. We have excellent hotels in the city, but the average daily rate (ADR) of ‚¬160 is way below that of similarly sized cities, and this obviously affects our revenue. The local corporate accounts give all hotels good business and account for the major part of occupancies. We also receive a lot of conference business from ministries and local institutions. Our hotel's location and facilities make it ideal for conferences and events. Leisure tourism is not very popular yet, mostly because of visa restrictions. There are many other countries that people can visit visa-free, and the five-star hotel sector loses out as a result. There are, however, discussions going on to implement an “e-visa“ program.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SEE OPPORTUNITY</h4><p>In Europe, the US, or developed countries such as Japan and South Korea, the IT sector is very developed. Azerbaijan is a developing country in that sense, and I see that distance as a business opportunity.</p><h4>STARTING POINT</h4><p>Declaring 2013 the “Year of ICT“ creates more awareness about the sector and will result in the launch of many projects related to the industry. For GoldenPay, it means we are inspired to embark on an extraordinary project this year.</p><h4>HORIZONTAL EXPANSION</h4><p>Starting in 2014, we will look to expand to similarly sized countries such as Georgia, Uzbekistan, or Belarus. Basically, we want to make sure that citizens' online needs are properly managed so that they can take care of almost everything online.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WORLDWIDE TARGET</h4><p>Everybody who uses mobile devices can purchase our products, as they are designed for compatibility with mobile phones, MP3 players, cameras, and tablets. We plan to sell our products worldwide.</p><h4>NO COMPETITION</h4><p>We have no competition because our charger is unique in that it is powered by kinetic and heat energy. There is also no brand loyalty with chargers and people generally choose quality, innovation, and portability over brand when purchasing.</p><h4>HELP IS COMING</h4><p>Azerbaijan needs to come up with a better policy for startups. Recently, the President emphasized the potential of the ICT sector and the Ministry of Communications of Information Technologies has announced that there will be an ICT Fund to support growth in the sector.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>FOR ALMOST ANYONE</h4><p>The services and products we have on our website are available to everyone, whether you are going to a restaurant or the cinema, or going on a trip in Azerbaijan or abroad. Almost anyone can benefit from a 50%-80% discount.</p><h4>MAIN MOTIVE</h4><p>In 2012, we expanded to Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan. The main motivation for being here in Azerbaijan is because there is great opportunity to provide better services and better access to those services from a financial perspective.</p><h4>A FEW SUGGESTIONS</h4><p>Around half of the population of Azerbaijan is under 30 years old, but there is only about 10% internet penetration. There are a lot of young people that can have access and can be integrated into internet culture.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The company was established in 1999 as SOA Kredit and specialized only in the mortgage-lending business. It had a small number of customers. However, it became recognizable in 2008 after it was renamed TBC Kredit. The change was not only in the composition of shareholders. There was a general reorganization of the entire company. Over the years, we have achieved nearly all the goals that were set before us. We have increased the customer base four fold, expanded our service network both in Baku and beyond, introduced a new product line, and started using new software. We created a base that contributed to the improvement of business processes in the company and created a strong team of professionals who, in my opinion, are some of the best in this field. In this ever-growing market our main priorities remain the transparency of business and maintaining customer focus. We will continue the development of all our existing four product lines. However, we will shift our focus onto microfinance and on the smaller part of the SME market. We will also continue our mortgage lending program, in which we try to offer the best available terms to the market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The low economic efficiency of banks is disproportionate to the level of risks in operations and the level of expenses. This, in turn, leads to bigger problems rather than positive outcomes, even in the medium term. Currently, all progressive banks realize that and direct their efforts toward the improvement of client services and the optimization of procedures. Our bank has a unique opportunity to properly build its decisions and choose approaches based on the enormous experience of VTB Group's banks in such countries as Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Georgia. By analyzing the best practices and knowledge of the group, we know exactly what effects our decisions and approaches have on the organization of the banking business. We understand how to build an effective IT system and a reliable risk management system. Despite the fact that we are not a large bank in Azerbaijan, we have been making very ambitious plans and working hard to achieve them. For the past 10 months, the bank has increased its monthly volume of credit operations by 8.5 fold, and as a result we have gone up eight places in the bank rating list. For us, 2012 is the year of increased activity in the field of auto loans and small business.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The bank has a very clear strategy. From day one, we have been focusing on micro- and small-business financing, and we continue to pursue this mandate and develop in this market niche. Today, we are the number one bank in terms of financing businesses of this size. Meanwhile, we have strong exposure to medium-sized corporates as well as a fair amount of exposure to the retail market. The main reason for our success is that we have a clear strategic focus, which is to educate our staff at a very high standard. We take on young talent, often directly from university, and educate and train them internally. We have an excellent motivation system, and I firmly believe that the market recognizes AccessBank as an institution with exceptional staff. We have a very strong presence in the region, with a network of 34 branches that is constantly expanding. We will open a further four branches in 1Q2013. Later in 2013, it is the plan to continue opening branches in the regions where we are not yet present. After a recent meeting with the branch managers of the bank, it became obvious that in most of the regions of Azerbaijan we are the largest bank. This is because we have placed a very clear focus on the agricultural sector, and AccessBank became the first bank in the country to launch a special loan product for clients in this sector.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I think a comparison of the 2013 state budget with that of 10 years ago describes the changes in Azerbaijan's economic development over the past decade more impressively than anything else. The government has approved a record high-state budget—almost $25 billion for 2013. This is huge for a nation with a population of just over 9 million. Economically, Azerbaijan has been developing at an amazingly fast pace. I am aware that according to the assessment of the Davos World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan now ranks 46th globally and is at the top of the CIS countries for the competitiveness of its economy. Also, it is very encouraging to see that the 2012 GDP increase was also sourced from non-oil sector growth, which means that the country is skillfully shifting its growth leverages to the non-oil sector. As Azerbaijan's long-term oil and gas development partner, we are pleased to observe that the country is gaining increased recognition as a major contributor to European cultural and sports events. With the success of hosting the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, Azerbaijan has now been elected as the host country for the first European Olympic Games scheduled for 2015.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Coca-Cola entered Azerbaijan in 1994, right after the separation of Azerbaijan from the former Soviet Union, as a sales and distribution company. We started production in Baku two years later in 1996. Coca-Cola is one of the first and largest foreign investments in the non-oil sector. Azerbaijan is a dynamic, young, developing, and prosperous country and—as in rest of the world—Coca-Cola is part of everyday life, and Azerbaijan is no exception to that. The Azerbaijani government is promoting new investments in the country by passing new laws and legislation to help increase FDI. Furthermore, these revisions and updates are introduced by the parliament to help existing businesses in Azerbaijan be an integral part of the world economy. Not only is the Azerbaijan private sector, but government agencies and organizations are also becoming an integral part of their counterparts with the rest of the world. Azerbaijan is developing very rapidly, and it is doing it in an organized and systematic way. The development is happening in all regions of Azerbaijan, as well as in the public and private sectors, law and legislation, infrastructure, economy, and government spending abroad.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Schlumberger actually first worked in Azerbaijan back in the 1930s. With the signing of the “Contract of Century“ it was clear there would be a significant opportunity for the company's technology and expertise to develop the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli (ACG) oilfield, and so the company was delighted to restart continuous operations in Baku. The most important investment Schlumberger has made in Azerbaijan has been in hiring and training engineers from Azerbaijan to perform services onshore and offshore. Today, Schlumberger employees from Azerbaijan can be found not only working at Azerbaijani oil and gas fields, but also in major oilfields around the world. I've been fortunate to work in some very interesting places in my career from the Empty Quarter in Saudi Arabia, to the North Sea, to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Canada. My latest assignment in Azerbaijan is no exception. From a technical perspective, the work can be very challenging with deeply buried, high-pressure reservoirs and challenging formations to drill through. The history of the country, and the oil fields here in particular, also make it a very rich and stimulating environment in which to work.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>On a regional scale, Azerbaijan could be a route for the export of gas from Turkmenistan once that comes online. In my opinion, Azerbaijan is less of a hub and more of a source for the EU, albeit not a major one. Once Shah Deniz II comes on stream, Azerbaijan will export 10 bcm to the EU. As a matter of comparison, France alone consumes about 40 bcm. The energy potential in Azerbaijan represents around 10% of the total consumption of the EU. It will play a role in providing competition and an alternative, but it will not be a dominant provider. However, this doesn't prevent Azerbaijan from being a major provider to some countries, which would be absorbing some of its production. New exploration technology might provide Azerbaijan with the capability to produce five times as much as it exports currently, but even that will not make it the EU's sole provider.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>I have been here since 2010, and it has been a very satisfactory time for us. We have seen very positive government action on many fronts. In business operations, many things have become easier, such as the tax issue. There has been major progress, and due to this, business opportunities will increase. However, there are still issues, the biggest of which is the lack of transparency. For an international company to thrive in this environment is not simple. We hope and believe this will improve. We see signs and action, but it will take a long time. For people thinking of investing here, I would advise getting an agent and starting the business slowly to see how things go. The selection of a partner is obviously the key factor for sustainable development. Schneider Electric in Azerbaijan owes its success not only to the quality of its solutions and reputation, but, to a great extent, on the right choice of strategic partners. Our business partners manufacture under our technology license, distribute our products, and integrate our products into theirs. Such co-operation makes our business in Azerbaijan very sustainable.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are a technical higher education institution in a sector that has traditional universities, the so-called two-year universities—a model imported from the US—and some specialized institutions like ours. We are based in the first technological park in the Dominican Republic, which states our strong specialization in ICT education, software, multimedia, and telecommunications. For that reason, ITLA is the top supplier of ICT experts for companies operating in the Dominican Republic. Our ITLA Content Factory is closely linked to our Cinema Faculty and all of the programs we offer within its framework. It is basically a professional-oriented tool for our students. I would like to add that our offering in this area covers the entire spectrum of professions related to the cinema industry: graphic design, 2D and 3D animation, and sound, for example. In this regard, we will strengthen our sound programs in 2013 in order to make them more competitive.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The identity of INTEC is closely linked to the idea of high-quality university education. This has held true from the very outset of INTEC, and we are committed to continue that purpose and maintain our standing as a model of education in the Dominican Republic. Over 40 years, we have evolved from a graduate university to a broad university, covering both undergraduate and graduate studies. I think this reflects the demands of the Dominican educational system, where the number of graduate students is relatively small. Indeed, INTEC is one of the universities with the highest percentage of graduate students. We are particularly strong in the fields of engineering, health, and business, but we have an intense activity in basic sciences and social humanities.  That means that we have a broad scope of subjects, with the technological approach as the common theme. Most of our teachers are from the Dominican Republic, but we also have teachers from other countries, including Cuba, Argentina, and Colombia, in addition to some teachers from Europe.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have signed many international agreements with universities in Spain, France, Italy, the US, and many other Latin American institutions. Most of the cooperation agreements are related to postgraduate courses and both student and staff exchange. The UASD is a highly recognized institution and very prestigious at the international level, and we are constantly working on improving the internationalization of our university through many different initiatives, such as online international postgraduate courses and mobility programs. One of our main future targets is to boost the overall number of online students at our institution. We have already developed a virtual campus and many subjects are already either taught or available online. The process of expanding our virtual campus is gradually taking shape, as more professors acquire the technological knowledge and skills to take their courses onto the internet. Our target is to have at least 30% of the subjects available at the virtual campus, especially as part of our postgraduate courses.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Universidad APEC was envisaged as a higher education institution to strengthen the sector and attend to the needs of Dominican students who wanted to pursue a university qualification with a special focus on business and economic areas. During the first years of activity, the institution was under a junior college model, similar to those in the US. Over the years, the institution expanded its activity and influence, and today it's a Fulbright university offering undergraduate and postgraduate courses. In addition to focusing on the business and economic areas of education, over the years we diversified our offering, adding courses in graphic design, advertisement, PR, and engineering—areas that attend to the needs and demands of the national productive sectors. Since Universidad APEC was established, we have always tried to establish strong ties with the private sector and enable our students to be directly in contact with the professionals within their areas of their studies via compulsory work experience and congresses, conferences, and other such initiatives.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROWTH PATTERN</h4><p>The Dominican Republic is definitely a country in a growth pattern and moreover it is getting more organized, which is the attraction of being in the middle of an emerging economic region. I think that this is the key to the growth patterns that the country has had in the last 10 to 15 years.</p><h4>FISCAL POLICY</h4><p>Fiscal policy has been better executed, and this provides the necessary confidence. As in any developing country, the informal sector starts to get organized, too. That gives you opportunities either to purchase, acquire, or launch joint-ventures with informal players and help them to formalize their businesses.</p><h4>HUGE NUMBERS</h4><p>There are probably around 300 major chains and other organized supermarkets and there are 55,000 smaller retail outlets. That is a huge number; you can see it as potential or you can see it as a barrier.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PERFECT COMBO</h4><p>We expect to see a combination of local growth and the expansion of our international activities. The products we currently have in the market offer some room to grow. At the same time, we must continue investing in maintaining our leading position.</p><h4>FUTURE GROWTH</h4><p>We believe that in terms of exports, the company has huge potential to grow in the future. However, we still need to decide whether we will keep producing locally some of our products where it is hard to produce competitive goods for foreign markets, or somewhere else.</p><h4>BRACE FOR IMPACT</h4><p>At present, we are experiencing some uncertainty in our country due to the change of government and the new tax reform President Medina wants to implement in order to address the current fiscal deficit of the country. This reform will definitely impact the industrial network of the country and the end consumers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BIGGER STAFF</h4><p>The company was established in 1991 with great hopes behind a business project focused on providing technology and equipment, as well as all the tools and products for the meat industry. Back then, there were only three people at Espalsa, and today we have over 200 staff.</p><h4>MEAT &amp; BAKING</h4><p>Thanks to our success within the meat industry, we decided to expand our activity to the bakery segment, in which we signed international partnerships and alliances that led to our leading position in the sector not only nationally, but internationally too. We also put a great deal of attention into providing our employees with training opportunities abroad.</p><h4>FOCUS ON EXPORTS</h4><p>We started exporting some five years ago, especially to the US, Haiti, and Central American countries. We believe that Dominican industries should focus on exporting, because that is the only way we can grow and contribute to the development of the country.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We take a client-first approach because we are a very competitive company; it is the nature of the company take care of its clients. CEMEX believes that there are huge possibilities in the country. In terms of housing, there is a 1.1 million-unit deficit. The roads in the country are paved with asphalt, but because of its geographical location and weather conditions, the roads only last three or four years. However, governments from around the world are opening their eyes to concrete roads, which could be a huge opportunity for us here and abroad. Recently, we opened two divisions: one for housing and one for construction, with the aim of supporting the growth of the market. Growth in the market will help CEMEX grow faster. There are many competitors here, and when there are downturns, strong competitors survive and the weaker ones fade away. If that happens we are hoping to be one of the companies that survives. We are the biggest company in the industry and we have the best cost position because our plants are more modern and more technologically advanced. We are by far the most environmentally conscious company of all, and those are the benefits that clients appreciate.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>As part of the complex economic environment we are experiencing currently, for an industry like ours, the main challenge is to maintain our passion for change, innovation, and research in order to achieve better efficiency. But above all, we seek to maintain our commitment to optimize and position ourselves as a cluster that supports the development of the construction sector in the country. Since 2006, activity in the cement industry has been decreasing. From 2006 to 2012, the market decreased 24%. Only in 2010 we recorded a 4% increase, which is on the small side, and in 2011 cement consumption decreased 8% if compared with 2010. In the first trimester of 2012, the Central Bank reported that construction fell 0.6%, and we believe this picture will not change by the end of 2013, in which we predict a 5% reduction of total demand. Although construction is a sector that largely determines the rate of the national economy, it is also in turn directly influenced by it. It is highly sensitive to public and private investment and thus a factor that will affect the sector improvement is that the government reactivates public works in order to stimulate the economy.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We made an investment in the production of 25 MW of electricity and this allows us to be independent in energy terms, meaning we don't depend on public energy. Today, we are considering making investments to connect our facility to a high-voltage network. It is a modern, environmentally friendly facility. We have installed an electrostatic filter, a project that was financed by the World Bank, and we had to respect not only local standards but international ones as well. It is a mixed filter because it works in two stages; the first electrostatic chamber eliminates dust, and material is then filtered again upon exit from the facility. This means we can eliminate harmful emissions into the atmosphere. Cement production needs to respect norms that are set by the regulator. We have products for the informal market as well as the industrial market. Domicem also has products that are exported, all with differing characteristics, in order to follow regulations set by other countries. The market is highly competitive and we are decreasing costs and acting aggressively. As an island, the Dominican Republic attracts a lot of tourism, and private investments will grow with the end of the global economic crisis.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Dominican Republic has experienced more than 20 years of steady growth, which is uncommon in Latin America. Our location is also a significant advantage. Many companies prefer to locate in the Dominican Republic because of the connection that we have to the US, Europe, Central America, and South America. I would also add to this that we have had more than 30 years of stable democracy. The Dominican Republic has witnessed smooth transitions of power between elected governments, and it has avoided the conditions that led to conflict in our country's past. Companies can find the facilities they need here. In addition, human capital is also improving as the Dominican youth become more knowledgeable and have greater access to information. One of the challenges that we confront as a country is the legal framework. It is important that we demonstrate that our laws and regulations are well defined and there are no surprises.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The Santo Domingo Chamber of Commerce and Production (CCPSD) is one of 30 chambers around the country. There is one in every province, and the role of the CCPSD is to give life to corporations and to register foreign companies that do not have an entity in the Dominican Republic. Everyone has the right to be present as a legal entity in the Dominican Republic doing business, even if you are not a Dominican national. That is very important, and all of that is facilitated in every chamber of commerce across the country. Three years ago we embarked on a huge project to make the mercantile registry into an online system that allows users to come online, complete an application form, and submit it to the CCPSD. It operates with unique digital signature technology and allows the quick registration of companies. Our challenge is to roll our system out across the entire country by the end of 2012, with the same characteristics we have here.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The year 2011 was very good, and we have grown a lot since 2009. That was the year that exports went down in quantity and value because of the global economic crisis. In 2010, we stood up again, exports increased, and in 2011 we saw important growth because we grew not only in quantity, but also as a source of dollars. Before, the economy had four pillars: tourism, remittances, free zones, and exports. Now, exports are second only to remittances as a source of dollars. Exports are important because, unlike the dollars earned from free zones, which are generated by companies that are established here by foreign investors, the dollars that come into the Dominican Republic through exports stay here. As a result, exports are a very important pillar of the economy right now. They grew more than 20% in 2011. We began exporting minerals again, which had stopped—especially ferronickel because of international commodity prices. Now, we have started again, the mining sector is growing once more, and it is a very important part of the economy.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>One of the top priorities of the Systemic National Competitiveness Plan is to establish a better and more attractive environment for investors; in order to achieve that, we changed the country's commercial code. In regards to this, we reformed the law on the establishment of corporations, making it more transparent and efficient as well as quicker to set up a company in the country. That gave us international recognition from the most respectable institutions, and I believe that has been the key in praising our work in terms of investor protection. At the same time, we have to keep in mind that the Dominican Republic is not declining in international rankings on competitiveness due to the lack of certain things, but because of the fierce and aggressive competitiveness among emerging countries. In fact, one of the latest reports from the World Bank's Doing Business unit says that the Dominican Republic is among the top-10 countries in terms of reforms and attractiveness in the 2005-2013 period. Overall, we work to keep improving yearly FDI figures.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our company belongs to a family-run business group, and we were established long before the new law on the securities market was passed in the Dominican Republic 12 years ago. We were founded in May 1991, and we were the first brokerage firm to be registered by the Superintendence of Securities with a SVPB-001 license in August 2003. Today, the company offers structuring financial instruments, counseling, intermediation, appraisals, and consulting in M&amp;As, as well as buying and selling various financial instruments such as bonds issued by the government of the Dominican Republic, Central Bank certificates, and publicly offered securities. At the same time, our business group is the largest exporter of organic cocoa in the region. Our group has traded this commodity for over 50 years in international markets, which means that from the first years of our existence we have brought international expertise to our clients. In addition, we are the leading company at the national level in terms of trading volume.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Valores León has been operating in the market for about 10 years. The Dominican stock market is rather small, as we are a small country. One of the most important steps was taken back in 2000, when the government passed the new law on the securities market. In 2003, the authorities approved the regulatory framework of what was to become the stock exchange, and two years later it started operations. The development of the stock exchange in our country is key; we are trying to build a trading culture among those seeking new economic resources for their companies to grow. Currently, the stock market trades debt securities exclusively. In the last few years, we have seen very important depth in the market created by the issuance of government securities. At the moment, both the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (BCRD) and the Ministry of Finance issue securities in the Dominican Republic, and these issuances have positively contributed to developing the country's trading culture.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 2007, this market was in its initial stages. There was not a single centralized government body responsible for issuing debt. They could all issue their own debt—the Ministry of Finance or a county government was issuing with different conditions and at different rates. In those days, it was very common for the government to pay debt providers with bonds or commercial papers for any type of investment. The market was to buy and terminate debt papers for the issuer. It was unprofessional, and so the stock exchange began operating. The BCRD was the main and dominant force in the secondary market. Since then, the changes have been huge. Today, we have a stock exchange, the Bolsa de Valores de la República Dominicana (BVRD), which is openly trading in several areas. We have a new program, initiated by the Ministry of Finance, to develop market makers. We are fighting to be one of the market makers selected to bring primary placements.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When we look back over the last eight years in this country, the evolution of our capital markets has been tremendous. Although the BVRD was created in 1989 it wasn't until 2000 when the Securities Market Law (19-00) came into play that we got the legal framework that established the agencies responsible for supervising the securities market as well as the roles of all market participants. And it wasn't until 2005 that the BVRD started operating based on the new legal framework. In the last couple of years, we have seen an amazing transformation of the securities market. Currently, we don't have any companies with their stock listed, and because of that we are a 100% fixed income exchange. However, we are pushing really hard to implement an equity market in the near term. Both the BCRD and the Ministry of Finance represent about 85%-90% of the local bond market and the other 10%-15% is comprised of 21 corporate bond issuers with over 30 different bond issues.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The solar park we are currently constructing will represent a rather small percentage at the national level. We expect to start its construction in the next couple of months and it will be finished within 10 months. The investment we have allocated for this project is about $150 million. However, we have the capacity to install about 300 MW of solar energy modules in the Dominican Republic, which would represent around 10% of the total energy it currently requires. Since the country is developing in economic and industrial terms, its energy needs will increase in the near future, and I believe renewable energy will play a vital role in covering its energy needs. The Dominican authorities play a significant role in the development of the industry. Currently, they buy the energy we provide through a recently signed power-purchase agreement. This agreement is a great step forward for the industry in this country, and I personally think that Enrique Ramí­rez, President of the National Energy Commission (CNE), and Celso Marranzini, Executive Vice-President of the Dominican Corporation of National Electric Companies (CDEEE), are key people for the sector, and they have always been very supportive of the industry. Each strongly believes in renewable energy as a strategic sector for the future of the country.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>By the end of 2012 and beginning of 2013 the country will have roughly 300 MW of installed capacity in renewable energy. This capacity represents an investment of around $900 million. The cost of energy is among the highest in the region, and that's why the government and the Comisión Nacional de Energí­a (CNE) are working to support the development of renewable energy projects in the public and private sectors. Our company is specialized in biofuels. To go into detail, the US biofuel industry is currently employing 48,000 people, generating around $2 billion in terms of household income. It's our belief that the Dominican Republic was all the conditions to replicate the US model, as the country relies very much on energy imports and is negatively tied to the volatility of fuel prices worldwide. The bio-fuel industry can change that pattern and save millions of dollars through the use of renewable energy. At the same time, industry can save large amounts of money by shifting to renewable energy. Using biofuels offers great advantages to everyone; thanks to our expertise and experience, we expect to play an increasing role in the energy industry in future years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Members of the Dominican government, including former President Leonel Fernández, approached the founder of the company in Spain in 2007. As part of his reelection campaign, the former President was looking for foreign investors to diversify the Dominican energy sector. GEDER decided to come to the Dominican Republic in June 2007 with senators, and they introduced the first renewable energy law ever. The law was passed in the Dominican congress one year later in May 2008, and it began a new era in renewable development projects in the Dominican Republic. The mindset of the people has changed. Over the years, politicians have changed their views; they now know the country needs renewable energy. The improved trade relations between the Dominican Republic and the US have also had an effect. President Obama's energy policies send a strong message to Latin American countries to be less dependent on fossil fuels, especially fuel from Venezuela. We need to find a way to help smaller countries achieve freedom through energy diversification. The process is also a lot quicker now, though. In the past, it could take four or five years to acquire a license; now it can be done in 12 months. The Dominican Republic-Caribbean Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) has also helped develop the sector.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>A GROWING SECTOR</h4><p>The insurance market is rapidly developing along with the national economy, and this growth is mainly due to the development of the market in particular, and the country in general. I believe that the sector could grow faster, because the Dominican Republic has one of the lowest rates of insurance product use per capita.</p><h4>SET AN EXAMPLE</h4><p>The current administration should set an example and show society how advantageous insurance products are. Therefore, the government should introduce some compulsory lines when it comes to infrastructure insurance.</p><h4>PLANS</h4><p>We currently have plans to expand our presence in the country, as part of the government's strategy to generate more employment opportunities for the population. Also, we are targeting an expansion of our activities within the micro and SME business segment, which will considerably grow in the near future because the government is to allocate around $10 billion for its development at the national level.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BEYOND THIS POINT</h4><p>Dominicans generally do not think too much about the future. A lot of people, through the micro-finance sector, work hard to buy a house, but then fail to insure it. This means that if something happens to the property, they can lose everything. We are trying to educate people beyond this point.</p><h4>EDUCATING</h4><p>A cooperative has to have principles, and one of our key principles is that of education. We exert 50% of our energy on educating members and the other 50% on selling policies. We have trainers from across our cooperative who hold meetings and run committees dedicated to education.</p><h4>PREFERRED MODEL</h4><p>People sometimes prefer their money now rather than later, and that is the model we operate under. After all, that is the market we are working in. We have been growing at the same speed as the rest of the insurance sector over the last few years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FOCUS ON TRAINING</h4><p>The insurance market currently offers plenty of opportunities, and it will offer even more in the near future. In terms of the strategies I want to implement at Mapfre BHD, I would like to focus on training.</p><h4>PARTNERSHIP</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has always been a strategic market in which Mapfre aimed to expand its business activities. The beginnings were tough, but after two years in the country we had the chance to establish a partnership with BHD Group, a key player in the insurance sector.</p><h4>UPCOMING CHANGES</h4><p>I would like to see greater transparency of data and more coordination. I am aware that the authorities are already working on a new insurance law that hopefully will support transparency and coordination, a much-needed change for our insurance sector.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>LAN Ecuador began its domestic operations in 2009, marking the beginning of a new era in Ecuadorean aviation. Currently, the business is offering its clients a wide range of rates, punctuality, consistency, and an easy reservations system, where customers can purchase tickets and check in via cutting-edge technology. We have followed through on our promise to provide the Ecuadorean people with a world-class service of the same quality that characterizes LAN Airlines' companies in Colombia, Chile, Peru, and Argentina. For two consecutive years, we have won the first prize in Quality of Service, awarded by the prestigious EKOS publication. This reflects the high level of satisfaction our customers feel, as the survey was based on their feedback. During our time in the country, we have transported more than 2.3 million passengers, connecting them not only to Ecuador but also to more than 800 destinations in 150 countries, through the airline alliance oneworld. The alliance has also contributed to the positioning of Ecuador as one of the world's tourism hotspots. Currently, the airline operates 56 weekly services along the route between Quito and Guayaquil, which is the second most important air bridge in the Americas. We also operate nine flights a week between Quito and Cuenca, as well as service to the Galápagos through Baltra or San Cristóbal.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>AeroGal is operating through a codeshare with TACA on its routes to Lima and Medellí­n. With Avianca, AeroGal goes to Bogotá. Previously, those routes were operated strictly by those airlines, but through this synergy, the routes are being operated by AeroGal. This is what you want when you seek alliances; an opportunity to use and create synergies. The aircraft and crew are based in Ecuador, and it was a good opportunity to increase the breadth of our services. Our main operations are domestic, and the Galápagos is our core market. The connections we have to Lima and Bogotá have strengthened that market. Our domestic operations include the coastal cities of Guayaquil and Manta, and cities in the Amazon region such as Lago Agrio and Coca. All the connectivity through Avianca and TACA with hubs in Lima and Bogotá has allowed AeroGal to service more passengers through our domestic market. AeroGal is the strongest operator to the Galápagos. We operate to two locations on the islands, and our main traffic is comprised of foreign visitors. There are also national tourists and the officials living and working on the islands. Our international traffic is made up of Europeans and visitors from the US. Cruise operators have booked entire planes of passengers traveling to the destination, whether they are departing from Guayaquil or Quito, to the Galápagos. Therefore, we are hoping to increase our operations to this popular destination.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We share the market with two direct competitors, and we have more or less one-third of the market each. TAME probably has a bigger share of the total market, because we fly to more destinations, and that's an important thing about us. Other airlines fly to destinations that will generate profit, which is fair business wise. TAME, however, has a different target—not only economic profitability, but what we call “social profitability." If we don't fly to certain airports in Ecuador, nobody will do it, and this would be negative for the economies of those regions. The government has made a huge effort to upgrade the infrastructure of airports, and the social impact of offering air services to more isolated communities is vast. TAME wants to be profitable, but we also need to fulfill a very important role in Ecuador. We want to differentiate TAME so it does not become a commodity producer, especially in important markets. We need to refocus our customer service on certain key routes, such as Guayaquil-Quito, add frequencies, and find ways to satisfy the needs of the business community. We offer some advantages for this segment, such as VIP rooms at airports or other products that are unique to TAME. We want to work on those advantages and give customers what they want. We have people at TAME that are very motivated to do a good job.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>LARGEST &amp; OLDEST<br></h4><p>We are the largest and oldest university in the country, and, in fact, we are the third oldest university in Latin America. We have over 300 years of history behind our institution's back.</p><h4>CHANGE IS HERE<br></h4><p>There is a renewed interest in changing the higher education system across the country, and we can include the Universidad Central del Ecuador (UCE) in this wave as well. The increased support of the government has been very important for public education, and the changes the sector has experienced have been very positive.</p><h4>INTERNATIONAL EDGE<br></h4><p>UCE has wide range of international agreements with regional, US, and European universities. Recently, we started implementing agreements with Asian universities as well. We have approximately 60 international agreements with other universities, and over 200 with higher education institutions at the moment.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>DEEP ROOTS<br></h4><p>Our university is a descendant of the Napoleonic University, which opened after Ecuador gained its independence from Spain, and was focused on educating qualified government employees. What we are looking for is greater openness and to be able to provide more updated services to the country.</p><h4>WELL KNOWN<br></h4><p>On one hand we are known in the country as a university and on the other hand we own a laboratory for civil engineering, to analyze soil and materials, where we have certain instruments that are unique in the country.</p><h4>FOREIGN LINK<br></h4><p>We have about 56 agreements with international universities. We have student exchanges, teacher exchanges, graduate studies, and post-graduate programs. We have agreements with Germany, the UK, France, the US, Spain, Italy, and Japan.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ONE OF THE FIRST</h4><p>We started in three fields with the College of Business, the College of Communications and Arts, and the College of Applied Sciences. This is one of the first research universities in Latin America, despite the fact that we don't receive any money from the state.</p><h4>REMARKABLE PLACES</h4><p>USFQ operates one of the most important stations in the Amazon, called the Tiputini Biodiversity Station. In an article by National Geographic, the author stated that “after visiting 13 countries, the most remarkable place in the world is Tiputini Biodiversity Station." We run the station in collaboration with Boston University.</p><h4>MOVING ON<br></h4><p>We have 5,500 students, but the university was meant only for 2,500. We've been adding rooms, but in two years we'll leave the medical faculty here, because the hospital is here, and maybe also the music program, but we'll move the main campus further out.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>RESEARCH IS KEY<br></h4><p>The main objective we are trying to achieve is to convert this university into a research university through sending staff abroad, replacing equipment, and constructing a knowledge park.</p><h4>ON THE INSIDE<br></h4><p>In the park, there will be six large research centers focused on the main areas of 21st century knowledge. These areas include biotechnology, nanotechnology, ICT, alternative energy, environmental and sustainable development, oceanography, and software development.</p><h4>ROOM TO GROW<br></h4><p>ESPOL Polytechnic University boasts the largest campus in Ecuador. The main campus occupies approximately 720 hectares of land, which has allowed us to expand in various ways. Firstly, we built all the academic facilities required for our programs. Secondly, we reserved around 200 acres for the knowledge park.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections31>

We provide services to more than 50 cities in every part of Ecuador, and we're present in most of the other small, economically active cities.</p><h4>DO IT FAST</h4><p>Our main focus is on international shipping. Our clients include individuals mailing documents to large corporations, local or foreign. We provide fast transportation, and that's our main advantage. Shipments from Japan, for example, can arrive in Ecuador in just two days.</p><h4>VERY ADVANCED</h4><p>I believe that the infrastructure in Ecuador is good and has demonstrated marked improvement. There's also a new airport being built in Quito. Compared to other Latin American countries, Ecuador is very advanced in this area.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>HUMBLE BEGINNINGS<br></h4><p>We are a Swiss company specialized in inspection, certification, and verification. We began in foreign trade commerce as facilitators, and our main services in Ecuador are inspections for banana exports and trade finance services.</p><h4>ALL THE WAY</h4><p>We manage global accounts in every country, with almost 100 affiliates worldwide, including Nestlé, Holcim, and a variety of fish producers, which is one of our main export industries. We manage the supply chain from the origin to destination.</p><h4>THE CHALLENGE</h4><p>One issue is that the Ecuadorean trade balance currently has a deficit of $1.8 billion. In 2007, Ecuador imported around $6 billion. Today, we are importing $22 billion. Consequently, Ecuador's major problem is to balance the trade deficit. Turning around the deficit will be the challenge in a short term.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WORKING TOGETHER<br></h4><p>The guidelines that we as general managers dictate are the responsibility of the cleaning, logistics, operational, legal, and financial staff, as well as post offices, tellers, drivers, and supervisors. The entire personnel of the post office have worked together to revamp the system.<br></p><h4>DEMAND FROM ABROAD</h4><p>We can reach any part of the world, but we are focused on the US, France, Spain, and Argentina, where many of the potential buyers of our products reside. Considering that Ecuador has been a migrant country over the last decade, Ecuadorean migrants are demanding our services from abroad.</p><h4>JOIN THE CLUB</h4><p>Club Correos is an international shopping club. It began with our customers mailing 20 packages per month and rapidly grew to over 2,000 packages daily. Customers can make a purchase, send it to the Club Correos office in the US, and we deliver it.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4><br></h4><h4>PAY FOR PLAY</h4><p>We work very closely with farmers and the company was one of the first organizations working to certify farms as organic. We began to enter into dialogue with people out in the fields. Because our employees  work harder to achieve this quality, we pay better.</p><h4>MORE ACCESSIBLE</h4><p>We are trying to make our chocolate more accessible by not including any allergens, and knowing what people want. For example, as many as 20% of people cannot consume or have difficulty with milk, so we avoid its use.</p><h4>FULL FLAVOR<br></h4><p>If you have a square of our salted chocolate with a sip of a very beautiful whiskey, you will discover a lot about the whiskey as well as the chocolate. It is a premium chocolate. It is not a low-price product, but people who understand flavor are hooked.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GREAT GRAPES</h4><p>The company began by producing table grapes on the premise that if we could grow good table grapes, good wine grapes could also be grown. Our plan was successful, and after we produced great table grapes, the wine grapes also worked out very well.</p><h4>ENIGMA<br></h4><p>Initially, it was tough to promote Dos Hemisferios as a product of Ecuador, because it is a country that is not recognized as a wine producer. However, after we sent our white wine, Enigma Chardonnay, to a contest in Mendoza, Argentina, we won a gold medal during a blind tasting.<br></p><h4>GET LARGER</h4><p>We have 360 hectares of arable land, but we only cultivate nine—we have ample space to expand. When we exported to Switzerland, we shipped a very small amount. With expanded production, we would be able to export to many countries and sell a higher quantity.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>GROWING VOLUMES<br></h4><p>With the increase in the volume of cocoa available, the amount that we produce annually has also naturally grown and continues to rise. We exported 7,000 tons five years ago, 9,000 tons three years ago, and 13,000 tons in 2011.</p><h4>WHY WORK WITH US<br></h4><p>We've been differentiating our product, particularly in terms of taste. We have a laboratory and we analyze the cocoa from all regions and towns according to our flavor profile. This is why the manufacturers like to work with us.</p><h4>NEW FLAVORS<br></h4><p>Cocoa has been fermented traditionally for 200 years, and it is a centuries-old process. We now have a modern fermentation process whereby we control the temperature and the humidity, creating a completely different technology that makes our beans taste different from those of our competitors.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our challenge is to innovate. This means that we need to be more educated about the industry. We have to apply new technologies to business and generate innovative products. Currently, one of our big breakthroughs is sustainable tourism. Ecuador has more than 150 certified operations in the area. Most are in the Galápagos, the Amazon region, near the coast, and in the Andes. It is one of our main strengths. Captur has its own training department, which prepares people for the industry. We prepare around 2,000 people a year. Universities are a problem, as they do not pay attention to what is required by the industry. The professionals that come out of universities lack knowledge in marketing and other areas. We have to work hard to compete with other top destinations in the region, such as Peru and Colombia. Those countries are also working hard to promote themselves. It is necessary to take demand into consideration and have a good strategy. We will start by training people, improving the business, and innovating. This is our challenge.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Guayaquil is one of the most affordable cities in Latin America in terms of accommodation. The expansion of Guayaquil's offers began with the construction of new hotels and the response to the demand that the city would be hosting congresses and conventions. Three-star hotels are proliferating throughout city because it's a segment that meets the demand we see from neighboring countries. At the same time, there is no need to worry about the weather, because the temperatures are mild all year round, which facilitates the trip. With the implementation of a large congress center, Guayaquil is ready to host international events, and this is the most profitable kind of tourism for the city. Thus, the city has seen increased activity in construction, job creation, and economic success. The tourism industry has experienced sustained growth every year. We are permanently working on expanding the North American market. Our strategy is also focused on tourism from neighboring countries, such as Colombia, Peru, and South America in general.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Ecuador has made a clear commitment to develop ethical tourism. Such a move does not jeopardize our competitive position compared to our regional neighbors. In addition, we have a competitive currency and better prices than our main competitors. However, there are some tax issues related to visitors and their activities in the country that put us at a disadvantage against our main competitors. I believe that the country should implement measures to provide tax rebates for tourist purchases in Ecuador, something Colombia and Peru already do. Such a move would make the market more dynamic. Visitors come mostly from the US and neighboring countries like Colombia and Peru. Nevertheless, we have a large number of visitors from Europe, especially from Germany, France, Italy, and the UK. In the last few years, we are seeing a considerable increase in the number of Argentinians and Chinese tourists, and we believe that the latter will become a very important market for us in the near future.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OUR NAME<br></h4><p>Café is an international word that everybody can understand. In Spanish, café means coffee, which is known today as the catalyst of the Industrial Revolution. This is a very important word, uniting cultures from different people all over the world. Put together, we created the Café Cultura, which evokes the image of people sitting around a table, talking about a variety of topics such as literature and politics.</p><h4>ALL FOR SALE</h4><p>Everything that we have in Café Cultura is made in Quito by hand. We perfected the idea of a boutique hotel; these handicrafts can also be purchased. The lamps, glasses, base plates, and tables are all for sale—everything is made here by highly qualified artisans.</p><h4>LIKE FRIENDS</h4><p>Traditionally, our clientele is comprised of people with the means to pay high prices, but prefer to stay with us because of what we are about, including our very engaging team of young individuals. The team truly provides a personalized service. We treat our guests like friends.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>EXPANSION PLANS</h4><p>We operate hotels in Cartagena and Quito, but Dann is planning to expand operations to other cities in the region. However, the Dann Carlton hotels are normally designed for business and leisure travelers.</p><h4>ATTENTION TO DETAILS<br></h4><p>I believe that the small details are very much appreciated during the days our clients stay with us. Therefore, we make constant efforts to cater to our guests' needs. This allows us to improve every day. We offer smart and fast transportation solutions at all times, offering our visitors the type of room and service they request and expect.</p><h4>APPROACH TO STYLE<br></h4><p>Our approach to style is different compared to other hotels. The company has always aimed for a signature look in our hotels, which is mainly seen in the newly refurbished guest rooms. However, style and decoration evolve fast, so the most important factor today is comfort.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUPPORTING GROWTH</h4><p>We have prioritized upgrading the hotel so that we can begin targeting the luxury sector. At the moment, we are still small, with only 50 rooms, but the project could grow to 100 rooms, and there will be a medical center established across the street. This will help support the growth of the hotel.</p><h4>GOOD BUSINESS<br></h4><p>There is a growing market for luxury accommodations in Guayaquil. There is a lull in the market right now, but we are working with the Guayaquil Bureau of Conventions to build business in Ecuador. Whenever there is a convention, it is good business for all the hotels.</p><h4>FROM THE GROUND UP<br></h4><p>Many hotels in Guayaquil are franchises that are part of international brands. That is the easy way to go about building a hotel business. We want to build our own brand from the ground up. Right now, there is no Ecuadorean hotel brand with the ability to compete nationally or internationally. We want to build a national brand with international links to fill this gap in the market.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NUMBER ONE</h4><p>Pichincha is a universal bank that serves all types of customers. Our microfinance program was established 15 years ago, when we found a very important niche in the market. Pichincha is not only the largest bank in Ecuador, but also the largest lender of micro credits in the country.</p><h4>GOOD EXPERIENCE</h4><p>The bank is with both the borrower and the lender throughout the process. Although it is an expensive banking strategy, it's very profitable in the economic and social sense, and these experiences have been fantastic for us.</p><h4><br>ELECTRONIC &amp; WIRELESS</h4><p>We process 300 million transactions per year, one-third of which are done through ATMs. An additional one-third are completed through the internet. This means that, in total, two-thirds of our transactions are done electronically.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FULLY COMMITTED</h4><p>Over the last 39 years, Banco Internacional has been committed to giving its clients products and services that offer real solutions to their problems. Throughout the years we've been mainly dedicated to credit intermediation in Ecuador's productive sectors.</p><h4>EFFICIENT IN PRODUCTION<br></h4><p>We have huge expectations regarding the export of non-oil products such as bananas, tuna, shrimp, flowers, coffee, cocoa, and hearts of palm. We are participating significantly in these sectors. Just as we have been very efficient in the productive sector, we are also successful in foreign trade.</p><h4>UNDERSTANDING</h4><p>We offer our clients a solid portfolio of products and services based on personalized assistance. We are dedicated to understanding the business, analyzing where investments come from, and managing the capacity for credit recovery operations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AAA CLASS</h4><p>Banco de Guayaquil has been operating in the Ecuadorean market for more than 85 years now, and today it is the bank with the highest credit rating—AAA neutral.</p><h4>EVERYWHERE MAN</h4><p>We have the largest branch network in the country: 191 branches and 780 ATMs. In addition, we have over 3,400 service points for our Banco del Barrio program, which is geared toward local SMEs. This allows us to be present in 216 of the country's 221 main urban areas, reaching 99% of the population.</p><h4>FAILSAFE<br></h4><p>New amendments in the Ecuadorean mortgage law will bring important changes to the sector, because, from my point of view, they are aimed at markets where mortgages for second houses drive the market, and they target future problems that Ecuador will have.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>VERY LIQUID</h4><p>The year 2011 was very positive for the banking sector in Ecuador; the banks reached significant levels of liquidity, and we saw significant growth in loan portfolios. The financial system remains very liquid, with a clear solidity and solvency above locally and internationally required levels.</p><h4>RISING DEMAND</h4><p>The regulations contribute to the management of risk and liquidity, and we have experienced an increase in the penetration of banking products due to economic development, and in the demand for consumer and car loans, credit cards, and mortgages.</p><h4>KEEP GOING<br></h4><p>Our main priority is to continue our expansion and development because we aim to increase our market share to up to 5% in the future. Today, we have a 3% market share. In order to achieve our goals, we need to maintain a growth rate above overall sector growth; something we have done over the last decade.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PROACTIVE PROMOTION</h4><p>Banco del Pací­fico has been in the market for 40 years and we have been very proactive about promoting our brand and our reputation for good service and state-of-the-art technology. We are proud of the fact that our reputation remained intact through the recent crisis.</p><h4>LOWEST RATES</h4><p>In 2004, we started promoting mortgages and lowered our interest rates from 16% to 10%. Since then, we have continued lowering our rates and we now offer the lowest interest rates of any private mortgage provider in Ecuador—normally between 8% and 9%.</p><h4>NEW WAYS<br></h4><p>There is very high demand across all industries right now as a result of the import restrictions the government has put in place. We see this as an opportunity for the local industry to diversify into sectors that were formerly dominated by imports, and we are exploring ways of offering financing in those sectors.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We use Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), which allows us to communicate with the meters bi-directionally, and it can be installed on any electrical system, regardless of the voltage level. We can send the meter a question, such as what the current consumption level is, and it responds automatically. If the inhabitant of the household attempts to remove or manipulate the meter, it sends a warning signal that we react to immediately. Through AMI we are lowering costs in many ways. In addition to mitigating our losses, we are able to read, verify, bill, and cut and reconnect electrical services from our office. Another project we are working on is developing a smart grid, which will be marketed in June 2012. With the smart grid, we will have our entire network displayed on a wall screen, and when someone calls the center we can see his or her location on the screen. We will request their name, account number, and a description of the problem. There may be a case where we have many inconveniences in the same circuit, and will therefore know the problem is a transformer. If another person from another area calls with a different complaint, the problem could be the feeder, and we would react by sending a surveillance vehicle. Everything is shown on the panel, and our responders will fix the problem and send information about its cause. Afterward, the information gets updated and the system refreshes itself.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We have been asked to advise other companies with lower development levels. In the commercial aspect, we have installed our system at five companies, and just recently we started with a sixth. This is a policy of the electricity supply sector and the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy. We will continue to help companies attain good business practices and help other companies that are a little behind in their development. We do it because it is one of the objectives of becoming a public company. The objective is to make all public service suppliers work under the best standards and to achieve an important technological leap. On the technological side we will incorporate a new commercial system. The Integrated System for the Electrical Distribution Administration (SIGDE) program is very significant as it is a huge technological leap. Empresa Eléctrica de Quito (EEQ) has a commercial system that is our pride and joy, but that system will be replaced by one that uses the newest technology available internationally, and the same will happen in every area, technical and administrative. It's a policy of the Ministry by which electricity distribution companies participate and EEQ is putting a lot of effort into making this policy a reality.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have launched a project in the jungle province of Morona-Santiago, where our conventional electric networks do not reach. To solve the coverage issues, Centrosur is installing a series of photovoltaic panels, and we installed the first 300 in 2011. By April or mid-May 2012, we will have installed 2,200 more panels, establishing a total of 2,500 panels dedicated to producing photovoltaic energy. We expect to install a similar number of panels in areas across Ecuador where it is not convenient to set up conventional networks. Through this initiative, Centrosur is paying special attention to the environment as well as cultures that have traditionally depended on the sun as a source of life. Through our own development, we have also created a marketable system that has been implemented for a variety of companies. The Ministry requested our products for companies along the coast and in the Andean region. The next step is the implementation of a unique commercial system that allows every company to become more efficient in customer service and debt collection. Our system has already been put to use in other companies, but the largest goal is to unify the processes. We will begin launching our system in combination with the Empresa Eléctrica de Quito approach to form a new process comprised of elements from each enterprise. Once the processes are defined we can move onto the development of a unique system.</p>]]></sections21>

We feel very proud that we were able to create this company in Ecuador.</p><h4>DOUBLE UP<br></h4><p>The expectation is that the size of our company will double from what it currently is, not only for the services that we normally perform, but from the introduction of this new field, Singue, with our partner from California. We are very confident that with these two projects we will grow to double the size that we are at this moment.</p><h4>NEXT BID</h4><p>We see the possibility to participate in the next round of bids and to diversify our services because we can perform additional jobs without the need to invest in too much in new technology.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NEW WAVE</h4><p>Over the last few years we have seen an increasing boost in new technology as well as environmental protection activities from the companies involved in the Ecuadorean oil and gas sector.</p><h4>KEY ELEMENTS</h4><p>Sertecpet is leaving a footprint on the sector in many regions, believing that it will bring us positive results in the near future. Innovation and R&amp;D have been the key elements leading the growth of the company, as they allow us to develop our own products.</p><h4>GROW &amp; EXPLORE</h4><p>We are very interested in all the mature fields in the country. Our main target is to consolidate the company as a leading provider of technological services and integrated engineering solutions, as well as to grow within the exploration area.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We can categorize our prospecting in two well-defined ways: metals and non-metals. In the non-metals segment, we are carrying out interesting projects, mainly in limestone and silica. These resources will allow the country to construct cement plants. We have engaged in prospecting to determine the best location to set up plants for the construction industry, and we expect to receive the first results by mid-2012. If the results are positive, we will launch cement projects of great magnitude, which is one of our goals in the non-metals sector. In silica, we are aiming to install a glass manufacturing plant, and we are in the midst of the first prospecting stages. Following the results, we will move on to the exploration stages. For these projects, we have to begin the process of obtaining the appropriate environmental licenses. The second direction of our prospecting activity is geared toward metals. We have identified some areas with huge potential in minerals such as iron sands.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Human resources is a very important issue in mining, and could be considered the main factor for the success of our projects. One challenging aspect is to find qualified human capital in the local market. Therefore, we are reinforcing our training programs, and require that all of our staff have studied beyond high school. We are also involved in technical and administrative training, and EcuaCorriente already has its first group of 30 employees that have graduated from our program, which includes training, theory, simulation, and practice. These employees have also been trained in machinery management. Currently, we are building a training center in El Pangui where we aim to train at least 100 people in machinery and resource management in 2012. In 2013, we will begin training more local people in terms of the refining phase and drilling. We also employ people at a national level, gathering the most qualified people and training them. Moreover, qualified people from China join us in carrying out certain work.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are one of the pioneer companies that has been able to maintain itself in the country. Considering the history of the companies that were present in Ecuador 17 or 18 years ago, we are one of the few that have survived through the difficult times in mining. Our strategy has been to come to agreements in every aspect, generating a good image and concept of mining that supports the government's efforts. Therefore, our company contributes to the government's goal of improving the quality of life; for us, it is really important to be responsible with our investments. We aim to develop projects that are fair for every party with clear legal and economic security. These factors are very important to International Minerals and its investors. The huge mining potential in Ecuador will continue for a long time. Bearing in mind the emblematic projects in the country, the exploration stage usually lasts about 15 years. To maximize the benefits of the resource, we must begin dynamic exploration and investment.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>This is the first time that Ecuador has been an attractive market for investments in mining, which entails a lot of challenges. Luckily, the government is fully supporting the industry. We are fortunate to have well-organized legislation, constitutional mining laws, and specific regulations. The government is pushing very hard to promote mining in order to offset the economic challenges the country faces. Although it is an intensive business in terms of capital requirements and operating costs, mining can help fill the investment gap that we are currently seeing in the Ecuadorean economy. Even though we are carrying out a medium-sized project in Ecuador compared to other mining countries, we are going to be the top gold mining company in the country as soon as we begin operations. Mining is going to lead business development in the future, especially for southern Ecuador. In collaboration with our Chinese colleagues at the Mirador and San Carlos projects, plus other gold projects in Azuay owned by International Minerals and INV Metals, we expect to represent 5%-6% of the country's GDP.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The strategy we have is quite different from what any other trade promotion organization does, in that we act like traders for other companies. So far we have seven clients that pay us a fee to sell their products, not only to promote them, but also to sell goods and close negotiations with buyers. This carries a risk because if you are the seller, you are responsible for the profitability. Trade promotion organizations go as far as to put the seller and buyer together, but then the closing of the deal has to be done by the private sector. In our case, we close the deal, we do the sale, and we get a percentage from it. In 2011, CORPEI conducted around 60% to 70% of its trade shows outside of the country. We were able to do this by transferring funds from the previous years to programs to be carried out in 2011, in order to find out if and how firms would buy services in the new scheme. We were very active at local trade fairs, and I can safely say that we will be continuing with these activities. We are organizing a big event in Ecuador called EXPO USA 360° in 2012, and we want to institutionalize this as one of CORPEI's big events. We are doing this in partnership with the local American Chamber of Commerce. We are trying to institutionalize some events that will be CORPEI's own and continue our participation in the most important international trade shows that we have participated in over the last years.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>“Ecuador Industrial" was the most successful project the Chamber of Industries of Guayaquil carried out in 2011. It was a national conference where medium and large companies in industry and commerce gathered to buy products, services, and parts from SMEs. We were able to transfer technological advantages and knowledge between companies of all sizes, and enable small companies to find credit from public and private banks. The Ministry of Industry and Productivity (MIPRO) played a major role by helping companies meet standards of excellence. SMEs were able to learn about formality, delivery time, and quality. We encouraged those companies to be more formal and transparent. We also substituted $74.2 million worth of exports in those two days, while giving business to local SMEs. We also have a lot of social responsibility projects, separate from MIPRO. We are building the System for Labor Integration (SIL) to get people with disabilities into the economy. We are offering training courses and preparing them to be a part of the workforce with equal conditions. We are the bridge between the private sector and the government. We explain to foreign investors where to invest, what to invest in, and what the advantages are of investing in Ecuador. The chamber also advises them on who to invest with, and encourages them to talk openly with the government, in case the government needs their investment specifically.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The government of Ecuador seeks to reduce the country's dependence on exports to the US by exploring new potential markets. However, this does not mean that the authorities want to reduce the overall percentage of exports to the US. Businessmen open new markets for our products, and even though the government is working to open new markets in Asia and the Middle East, these countries are not used to our main export products. Therefore, there is less potential in the immediate future. I believe that in the long term these could be excellent markets for our main export products. In addition, both the US and European markets have more than 250 million inhabitants each, which comprises a huge market for us. One of our main targets at the moment is to increase our presence within the business community through events. AmCham is working to broaden its range of activities, in terms of customs, tourism, logistics, entrepreneurship, and our relationship with the government. The mining industry is one of the sectors with the best potential to attract FDI to Ecuador. The agriculture and fishing industry, especially the shrimp segment, are also very attractive sectors for foreign investors; we have many climatic zones and very fertile soil. In this regard, I personally believe that the wine industry will bring much profit in the medium to long term.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MILITARY START</h4><p>We have historically provided the defense sector with military equipment. Over the years, the company grew, and we started to produce weapons and ammunition. We began producing explosives for military use, and today we sell our products to the construction sector for hydroelectric projects, roads, mines, and oil.</p><h4>BIG BANG<br></h4><p>Our explosives production unit has become increasingly more important, and we have established a strategic alliance with the Austin Powder Company in the US.</p><h4>DECREASING CHEMICALS</h4><p>As the cities of Guayaquil and Quito grew, they got closer to our facilities, and because we are also near flowing water, we had to invest a lot in water filters because of the smelting furnaces. The furnaces also produce a lot of emissions, and so we also invested in decreasing the chemical component.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MAIN SOURCE</h4><p>The main source of investment during this period has been from the government of Ecuador. The authorities have developed key infrastructure projects and invested around $5 billion in the sector for the construction of roads and bridges.</p><h4>SUSTAINED GROWTH<br></h4><p>Today, the demand for steel products in the housing and transport segments of the construction sector is fully covered by national producers. These segments have enabled the steel-manufacturing sector to experience an annual sustained growth of 8% over the last few years.</p><h4>TURN AROUND</h4><p>Currently, the sector is mainly focused on meeting local demand. A few years ago, imports outweighed local production, and one of our main targets was to turn this situation around. Fortunately, we can say that we succeeded.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BIG PICTURE</h4><p>In Ecuador, we have two production plants: one for food products (ice cream and margarine) and another for hygiene products and laundry detergent. Overall, we produce 120,000 tons of goods and enjoy $235 million in turnover.</p><h4>MAKES US PROUD</h4><p>Most of our products are made with Ecuadorean raw materials, which has helped to form our very strong brand name. We are proud to produce goods with a very distinctive Ecuadorean and Andean flavor, something that is in high demand in the Latin American segment.</p><h4>HERE AND BEYOND</h4><p>Consumers in Ecuador tend to prioritize price and quality over any other factor. Therefore, these are two of the features we always seek to boost at Unilever, thanks to our extensive network of production plants not only in Ecuador, but also in the entire region.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4>HERE TO STAY</h4><p>For us, coming to Ecuador has always been positive. We are constantly learning and aiming to achieve sustainable growth. We came here with the intention to stay; we are planning for the future by envisioning continued investments and growth in a responsible and sustainable way.</p><h4>HUGE VOLUME</h4><p>We operate from three production plants, 32 distribution centers, 13 production lines, and 600 sale and delivery routes. We cover the entire Ecuadorean territory, a total land area of 256,000 sqm, reaching a population of 14 million people.</p><h4>GROWTH OBJECTIVES<br></h4><p>The main objective for 2012 is to maintain sales volume growth. We are investing in the improvement of our production lines with the goal of increased efficiency. To do this, we will replace older equipment with higher production capacity tools.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THRIVING POPULATION</h4><p>Our aim is to help our consultants grow personally, professionally, and economically. People join the company, stay in the company, and thrive with the products and the sales system. We work heavily with incentives, premiums, trips, conventions, and seminars.</p><h4>DEGREES OF BEAUTY</h4><p>We started manufacturing in Ecuador in 1985 and used to produce lipsticks and nail polish. Later on we moved into fragrances, which today make up 50% of our sales. But we also do creams, healthcare products, deodorants, and shampoos—a whole range of beauty products.</p><h4>TURNING TO IMPORTS</h4><p>In the beginning, more people were consuming local products, which was good for everyone, because taxes were hurting imported products. But all of a sudden, especially in fragrances, which were highly taxed, people began turning away from national products, and opting to buy imported goods.<span></span><br></p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>PRICE CONTROLS</h4><p>In 2011, we had a good supply of milk, which is our basic raw material. With the implementation of new infrastructure in provinces such as Manabí­, it was much easier for us gather a good milk supply. We were able to increase milk production and stabilize its price.</p><h4>TIMES TEN</h4><p>To boost production we began a program with small-scale farmers and suppliers who were producing no more than around 50 liters a day. TONI provided training on how to produce milk, and many of the farmers began processing 500 liters of milk per day.</p><h4>START EXPORTING</h4><p>In Ecuador, we have a 75% market share in all of our product segments. For that reason, we can't expand at the speed we would like to. We recognize the need to either diversify with new products or start exporting our existing products to other countries in the region and to the Ecuadorean communities that live abroad.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has been in Ecuador for 18 years and our business model has been successful. We create companies that then propel business in the country. Microsoft's model is indirect in its approach; we are giving opportunities to local companies to offer value-added to the market. Microsoft invests more than $9.5 billion in R&amp;D on a worldwide level. We aim to create tools that support local industries as they develop and innovate using our software. You can develop on top of our tools and then we can sell the solutions. Microsoft has heavily impacted the Latin American economy. For every dollar Microsoft earns in Latin America, the local economy makes $12. We believe that people should have access to technology, especially while studying. This technology needs to be interoperable. When conducting research, students must have access to every kind of technology in order to increase the opportunity to innovate and create new ideas. In schools, we uphold Microsoft's policy to provide free products so that students can be exposed to as much technology as possible. The private sector supports various technological solutions. However, there has been a very strong shift over the past four years, and the private sector is becoming more conservative in its outlook. The public sector is starting to invest a lot more in ICT. We are seeing the public sector look for technological support as it works toward becoming more automated.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>I believe that the Ecuadorean market has yet to reach the maturity levels of others in Latin America, but it is growing aggressively and faster than other countries. I am convinced that the market will reach the maturity levels similar to other countries in Latin America such us Colombia and Peru. This trend is apparent even when we interact with other companies; the level of conversation is different than it was three or four years ago. The qualifications of the people involved in technology are also very different from what they were before. The market demands more specialization, dedication, services, and consultancy. We have a portfolio that allows us to offer a complete solution for our clients, from being a supplier to being a long-term strategic partner. IBM is able to deliver long-term, value-added proposals designed to help companies transform their business, become more competitive, offer better services, and therefore attract investments to the country. Considering the competition in the Ecuadorean market, there's no other company that can offer what IBM Ecuador has. We are able to enhance the quality of life that has been lost in many places because of the rapid growth of cities. By 2015, 60% of the world's population will live in urban areas, and we are already experiencing collapses in many parts of the world due to a lack of water, unstable electricity supply, and heavy traffic.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our main goal is to share with the public how to increase the number of broadband subscribers in Ecuador. We want many new projects, especially in revenue control or anti-fraud management. The main opportunity here is broadband mobile access. The main opportunity is to jump from the current situation to having huge coverage in order to supply broadband access everywhere, including some rural areas that are very expensive to cover. Not only Alcatel-Lucent, but all the operators in general should work toward that goal with a new business model, trying to equalize the top market with these new requirements. In Latin America the same opportunities exist in Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Chile, and Argentina. For Latin America in general we need to promote not only technological innovation, but also the economic means to make the most of these opportunities. Additionally, opportunities exist in movies, pre-paid TV, and gaming, areas that require strong bandwidth and represent new opportunities, not only for service operators and infrastructure suppliers, but also for software developers, cloud technology, and services. There is a new policy to link all public services to one cloud system, which means health, education, and other public institutions could be managed from one cloud across the entire country. This is a good starting point.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>By mid-2008, the market started feeling one of the biggest financial and economic crises the world has ever witnessed. The GCC was hit and the situation became extremely tough and difficult. Since then, the situation has remained difficult, but we bounced back and made sure that our business would thrive by sticking with our customers and clients, serving them at our utmost best and thereby gaining their trust and confidence. However, in our experience, investment in value-added services was extremely challenging. It is hard to make people understand that while it is based on intelligence and human resources, there is still a certain level of risk when you invest in a company like Cellempower. Though we are profitable, and we weathered the storm, there are still challenges—it is just the way the country is. The attitude of the investors or institutions is extremely conservative regarding this innovative ICT business, which is now generating two—sometimes three—digits of growth, year-in and year-out. ICT revenues represent more than 35% of the telecoms industry's total revenues in less than five years' time. We are as confident as the serious analysts that this sector of mobile value-added services and data in general will continue generating more wealth and opportunities, thanks to the technological readiness, quality of the terminals, and the involvement of different major players.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The local film industry in Dubai is still in its early stages, and the Emirate is experiencing a very interesting phenomenon. Both fear and excitement spread rapidly here, and I would not be surprised if filmmaking catches on at a similar speed. Anything that grows fast can be very risky as well, but so far the spirit of the industry is daring and fearless. A decade ago, there was very little infrastructure for filmmaking. Today, many more resources are available—whether filmmakers seek crew or equipment. I can confidently say that I have made a film in the UAE without hiring equipment from overseas. However, we still have a lack of personnel in the field. In film, there are many departments, and in Dubai, it can be difficult to find a specialized pyro-technician, precision driver, or stunt master. We do fly in specific crewmembers, but the basic actors and technicians are here. Film fever has infected the Middle East, especially in the GCC. To be more specific, Doha, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai are increasing their efforts in film education and awareness through new programs, workshop training, university courses, and festivals. In the past, the Dubai International Film Festival (DIFF) was the only celebration of the industry in the region, but today we have over five film festivals in the Gulf. This is a very good sign that there is increasing demand for film, and many young aspiring filmmakers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We offer SMEs web stores that address their branding needs. For retailers without e-commerce infrastructure of their own, we provide an online platform to sell their products. We are trying to build an e-commerce community. If we do not come together, there will not be an industry. Therefore, we are trying to cater to businesses as much as we are trying to cater to consumers. Other innovations we are introducing concern online payments. We are introducing bank transfers as an option for those customers who do not wish to share their credit card information online. These customers can also purchase pre-paid cards and control the money they spend at Logta. Logistics is very important, and couriers now have to enhance their operations related to e-commerce, or new players in the market will fill this void. Some integration is needed between retailers and logistics. Retailers need to improve their inventory of goods available on online platforms. We notice that logistics operators do not treat online shoppers very seriously, and the quality of their operations as far as e-commerce is concerned falls short of customer and retailer expectations. Also, there is room for investments in warehousing, which we have already started in Saudi Arabia. This model had been applied by Amazon for a long time, and we are adopting this model gradually, trying to implement it in a way that speaks to the needs of the region.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>LONG TERM</h4><p>We have been operating in the Middle East for almost 30 years. The extent of our operations has come about through the business units that we have acquired over this period of time. We have organizations that have been with us for the past 30 years across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and other parts of the Middle East.</p><h4>MOVING AROUND</h4><p>The spread of our business is particularly focused on energy, retail, and automotive. These are the growing sectors. For example, building a refinery in Abu Dhabi implied the logistics of moving the products from the source in Korea or Japan into the UAE. In retail, a good decision is to bring products into Jebel Ali Free Zone.</p><h4>GREAT OPPORTUNITIES</h4><p>We always look at completing acquisitions that will bring value to our portfolio. Within the MENACA area, there are some great opportunities. We have a presence in 12 countries. There are another six countries that we could move into. Some of the interesting markets for the future are Libya and Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>NICE DRIVE</h4><p>The Al-Futtaim Group is the one of the largest car importers in the UAE, representing a huge share of the market with our wide variety of car brands such as Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Volvo, Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge, as well as Volvo and Hino trucks.</p><h4>THE BELIEF</h4><p>We believe strongly in delivering logistics services to the market outside of our Al Futtaim Group. The purpose is two-fold. One the one hand, I believe that the size of our operations in logistics open us up to an excellent leverage opportunity in the market. On the other hand, if we can win large customers in the market, it proves our abilities and it keeps us on edge with the requirements and expectations.</p><h4>THE TRADE HUB</h4><p>The Dubai trade platform that has been developed here in the UAE is the most amazing tool I've seen, and it can compete with any other in the world. The ease of doing business, establishing a company, and conducting highly automated transactions are some of Dubai's best features.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>HERE'S THE HUB</h4><p>Dubai has developed into one of the main global logistics hubs, through the commitment from the Dubai government to build world-class air and ocean ports and port facilities supported by the free trade zone concept and a transparent regulatory environment.</p><h4>FIRST IN</h4><p>We are among the first companies to operate at Dubai Logistics City, and we spent quite some time to establish and implement the processes, in close collaboration with the local customs and DWC authorities as well as DNATA. Every entity was eager to support us.</p><h4>VERTICAL FOCUS</h4><p>Generally, we do not invest heavily in infrastructure and trucks. Instead, we prefer to work with strong local partners, extending our global network. We also form partnerships to develop strong IT solutions for our vertical focus.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>THE CONCEPT</h4><p>STORALL is one of over 30 companies under the holding company A&amp;H Al Ghurair Investment LLC, which is one of the leading groups in the private sector, operating across a spectrum of various industries such as hospitality, education, marketing, manufacturing, and logistics. The concept of STORALL was developed in order to offer a variety of storage solutions.</p><h4>UNDER ONE ROOF</h4><p>The beauty of the STORALL model is that everything is under one roof. For example, institutional clients such as banks might lease a few units of self-storage that they prefer to manage independently but also use our warehousing for top-tier inventory management reporting systems.</p><h4>GROW IT</h4><p>We are increasing our capacity by several thousand cubic meters in both our warehousing and self-storage facilities. We have expanded by 30% in the past years and are currently finishing an additional 25% expansion to be followed by another 20%-25% expansion by the end of 2012 or early 2013.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AT ONCE</h4><p>Zones dedicated to the ICT, education, and media sectors were established at the same time, in line with the idea of building a knowledge-based economy in Dubai. The idea of a media zone was not new; when Dubai Media City was established, similar zones had already been launched in locations such as Jordan and Egypt.</p><h4>BEST BANDWIDTH</h4><p>In general, it is very important for us to keep the ICT infrastructure up to date. We are a leader in terms of fiber-optic distribution within the UAE, and that is an advantage. Within Dubai Media City, we are continually working with our telecommunications partner to provide the community with premium services, such as high-speed bandwidth.</p><h4>ENHANCED UPGRADES</h4><p>We continue upgrading our equipment, because what was useful 10 years ago is not effective today, especially in terms of online content and digital media. We are working closely with the government to enhance these upgrades.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SERVING DIRECTLY</h4><p>We had to invest in our ICT department, and so we created our own telecoms department within the free zone to specifically serve our partners directly. For example, we temporarily deployed a state-of-the-art platform by Cisco, and we were the largest community using IP telephony at that time.</p><h4>SPACE FOR CHANGE</h4><p>Today, we have more than 1,300 ICT players operating within Dubai Internet City. We had to plan the right environment for those ICT companies, and in just 10 years we've been very successful in attracting almost all of the key players. Every year we review the industry's requirements and provide space for change.</p><h4>GET STARTED</h4><p>We are fostering innovation by establishing the telecommunications center, subsidizing services for young entrepreneurs, and soon we will be announcing other packages for locals who want to get started.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>WORLD CLASS</h4><p>We are focused on the service aspect of the industry. The last survey we conducted revealed that 97% of our clients would recommend us to other clients. We are very proud of this. Secondly, we aim to deliver IT processes, and we are world class in this respect.</p><h4>BUZZWORD</h4><p>The buzzword for a number of years has been cloud computing. However, we are in the early stages of adopting this technology. The SME segment is much faster on the uptake, especially for software services. We are also seeing the adoption of hardware-related components of infrastructure.</p><h4>TAILORED FOR SMEs</h4><p>We have a new initiative for SMEs, which are enjoying huge growth in the UAE. We have a tailored offering for these mid-sized companies to begin producing and operating more efficiently.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We provide a complete cycle of services for investors, whether designed for development or management. Investors come to the market with a pitch for land, and we find the land that suits their development plan. When they decide to develop, we find the best architects in the market and accompany the architects with our engineering team, which monitors every stage of the project until completion. The moment the building is ready, our management teams oversee the lease or sale of the building. Our services have not changed dramatically; we have only refined our processes and become more efficient. Some areas will require attention in the future. For example, we have to invest in facility management and improve our services to tenants. We are offering high-class facility management to tenants and landlords, which has evolved and improved compared to the early days of the company. On the residential side, investors can now purchase property for 50% less than in 2007 or 2008. Rental prices have fallen, which means that the value of a property will eventually decrease. We have experienced a drop of 40%-50% in rent, which reflects the value of a property—now is the time for investment. On the commercial side, there are great deals on the table where investors can secure a steady income increase of 8%-10%. A number of deals are locked with lengthy lease contracts, which are good for new investors.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>wasl Properties was established to act as a property manager, and it specializes in management services. This model has been successful over the past four years and is starting to set a benchmark in the market. Overall, the wasl brand is now set as a benchmark against which other service levels are being measured. We have a fairly large and diverse portfolio of commercial and residential properties under our management. We focus more on mid- and low-rise properties, as opposed to high-rise, and we also offer villas and townhouses. There are around 1,000 villas in our portfolio, in addition to 25,000 units distributed between low- and mid-rise housing units. We also have a large portfolio of industrial lands that we rent out to investors on a long-term lease basis. Furthermore, we are moving toward managing freehold properties with our owners association management services. Finally, hospitality comprises a big segment of our portfolio. There is no doubt that there has been a reduction in the level of development in the last three years. However, we at wasl have been doing well since we offer a high level of services. The crisis has witnessed some owners reducing the level of services. Some owners even reduced maintenance of their properties. Yet, the market is witnessing a strong recovery, with increased levels of real estate transactions in the freehold market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The facility management (FM) industry in the Middle East is still underdeveloped, and the business is still in its nascent stage in the region—here the service delivery is largely in a reactive mode. There is a serious skill set issue within the work force industry; we also have an issue with the lack of understanding of the concept of facility management. We operate with different set of enterprises, some only have a reactive approach—they only call us when there is a problem and have zero vision of preventive planned maintenance. Then there are companies that take serious note of FM, adhering to the planned preventive regime. Thus, there are two environments in which we operate: reactive and preventive. For this part of the world, FM is very new, and another challenge is finding a skilled work force at different levels of management. Generally, when buildings are designed, developers must incorporate and integrate FM. Architects create utopian structures for which it is virtually impossible to build efficient FM models thus impacting the service delivery or resulting in higher FM costs. For example, often in context to façade cleaning in certain skyscrapers, due to the complicated designs and structure, the delivery becomes complex and costly too, therefore FM-friendly designs ensure lower maintenance costs, and therefore boost investment returns and reduce operating costs.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>I think we all agree that in terms of the way that the patient, the purchaser, and the provider work together, the balance in this country is not right. It's not right because there is no gatekeeper that controls how many times a citizen of the UAE can access health care. It can be accessed as many times as a person chooses. A patient can go to 12 different doctors for the same condition on the same day, and the Thiqa Program will pay the invoices for each consultation. There is no incentive for the patient to stop getting health care. In certain situations pre-authorization is required, but anything under AED1,000 will be automatically covered. Patients here believe that they are only doing right by themselves in getting third and fourth opinions. This practice is not seen as being distrustful of any of the individual doctors, whereas in the UK people are rather diffident about asking for a second opinion. It erodes motivation for doctors, and in the long run, I firmly believe that it does the patient more harm than good.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The market here is unique purely because of demographics. Some sources put the average age at around 30-32. Less than 1% of the population is over the age of 60. Dubai has one of the highest migrant populations in the world—80% of the population is expatriates. Considering these factors, healthcare needs to be specially tailored, which means focusing on a lot of young families through pediatrics and maternity specializations. The other specific factor here is that there are a lot of conditions related to lifestyle, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease, even in young people, and the corresponding treatments need to be accommodated within the healthcare system. Rashid Hospital also has one of the most fantastic trauma departments in the world, and this is crucial due to the amount of road accidents that occur here. We came here knowing there was going to be a lot of competition within Dubai Healthcare City. We felt confident that what we offer is unique, and we know we operate hospitals to the highest standards.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The services that we provide here are of a general and acute care hospital, where we have all specialties under one roof. You can call it a one-stop shop for healthcare services. We are also adding some new services because our target is to be a medical hub in the region. In that vein, in the second phase of the project we are developing six center of excellence with 50 beds each, so that we can foster different specialty centers. These specialty centers have been designed purely in partnership with the German universities. So, before people go to Europe, they will think twice, and consider coming to our hospitals for treatment instead. To further boost this idea, we have planned for a medical tower accommodating 200 clinics for the community-based doctors. Furthermore, this project will also include a post-graduate training center attached to these hospitals. This will help to identify and attract the best healthcare professionals from around the globe. In terms of our relationships with vendors and suppliers, we have developed very long-term relationships.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>There is definitely strong demand in the market, and that is what is driving the success in the UAE and Dubai specifically. The health authorities are taking bold steps to open up the market to private sector players and increase competition and therefore quality. One example of this is Abu Dhabi's introduction of mandatory employer-funded healthcare for all nationals and residents of the Emirate. This has opened up a great deal of choice for patients and enabled providers to compete in terms of quality. It has been a real success story so far. We have 1,300 registered patients, and that number is growing every week as more and more people find out about us and word spreads about the high-quality care we provide. Around 30% to 40% of the surgeries we have performed to date have been revision surgeries for people who have undergone procedures before either in the US or in Germany, Singapore, Thailand, or locally. Our physical therapy has been a hit, and we are very happy with the outcomes we have seen.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>A PHENOMENON</h4><p>We started our real estate venture very early on in Dubai and were among the first private developers to launch operations in the Emirate. Our business started in late 2002, due to the implementation of new laws in May of that year, when the real estate sector became a phenomenon.</p><h4>BEST BUSINESS</h4><p>The rental pool program is connected to our hotel apartment developments. We believe that serviced apartments in key locations are the best business. This business model creates more benefit for the customer than just a simple hotel room.</p><h4>FOLLOW THROUGH</h4><p>The key to surviving the crisis was to plan for building each and every project, despite the speculations around the topic. We focused, launched a project, and ensured that we could build it; this has been our strategy since the beginning.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>DELIVER &amp; MAINTAIN</h4><p>Dubai Pearl is an entirely new project being developed with the support of Abu Dhabi's Al Fahim Group, one of the UAE's most highly respected business conglomerates. The simplicity of the new master plan and modularity of the construction grid have made the Dubai Pearl project scalable and relatively easy to deliver and maintain.</p><h4>NEXT GENERATION</h4><p>Comprising 1.86 million sqm, Dubai Pearl is currently the single largest luxury development being built in the Emirate. It represents the next generation of luxury developments within the city, built to the highest architectural standards with an unrivalled grouping of global brand partners.</p><h4>ON THE EDGE</h4><p>Companies such as Dubai Pearl, with well thought out strategies and developments that are able to demonstrate value and sustainable advantages, offer a competitive edge in the long term. This is the ideal time for developers to chart their long-term strategies and look for the next growth curve.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SURVIVE &amp; DEFEND</h4><p>Our portfolio of finished products is worth $600 million, and the projects have been delivered and are now occupied. We managed to survive the crisis, defend our name and reputation, and maintain our contacts while waiting for the economic climate to improve.</p><h4>SEE THE LIGHT</h4><p>We are not expecting a repeat of the eight-year development boom, but we are expecting the industry to normalize. With capital gains, our numbers average between 15% and 20%. We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we are far from a full recovery.</p><h4>FLOATING TIME</h4><p>We consider ourselves to be experiencing what we call “floating time,“ which has continued for about three years. During this period, we have been seeking new opportunities as investors and businesspeople. We are looking to the markets of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, and even Jordan, Egypt, and Libya.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We are starting to see more tender projects in every field, especially in construction and materials. When the recession happened, people started to do more refurbishment, and it is amazing how that segment has developed. We managed to find work, despite the fact that the competition is fierce. During the boom, we saw many new construction companies from abroad start up, but most of them have not survived in this tough market. However, the companies that were originally in Dubai are persevering. Some smaller companies did stay in the Emirate, but the volume of work has definitely decreased over the last three years. Dubai is getting back on track, and we are very proud to have a leader like HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. He worked very hard, took on all the pressure, and did not blame or point fingers. Instead, he made a comeback, and he led us to the positive situation we are in today; many of Dubai's financial problems are dealt with, and everything is under control. We have gained credibility in the international market, and more global companies want to come back to Dubai. We have already begun to see many people return. Originally, Dubai was based on trade and services, and we are starting to build a financial hub. We have never been based on development or the buying and selling of apartments. In 2011, 150,000 new residents moved to Dubai.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The focus is now on the infrastructure demand in the Arab world, driven by the huge growth in population. What that growth means is the need for more housing, water, power, and sewage lines, and this is the core specialty of the integrated engineering services that Drake and Scull offers. We are seeing tremendous growth in this part of the world and also in Asia and North Africa, which is why we are now expanding into India, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Algeria, and Djibouti. There are substantial opportunities for our services in these areas and especially in the water and power sectors.  These prospects are here and they are here to stay. It's not about a trend—it is about a position. There are plenty of projects that we are executing at the moment across our entire business streams in the MENA region, so the business model of Drake and Scull follows a pattern. We try to meet all demands in the construction industry from end to end while maintaining the highest level of quality and international standards.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Abu Dhabi is building nuclear energy, and we are technical advisors for that program. We were the first company hired, almost three years ago. Dubai is talking about building a possible nuclear facility, and if that materializes, we would have an interest in that. To me, renewable energy is the future in this region, despite the traditional wealth of oil and gas reserves. In the longer term, especially with the oil and gas crisis, these commodities are being seen as more useful if exported, so governments are looking for means to generate renewable power. It's not only economic—there are also environmental concerns in the long term, and I really applaud the UAE for being a pioneer in that respect. Masdar City is a good example of that. Such initiates, creating a new lifestyle without generating carbon, are an important consideration for GCC countries. I believe that there will be more renewable energy in the industrial sector here, such as in the poly-silicon industry. In Qatar, we are involved in a project to make a polysilicon facility. We believe that renewable energy opens new markets, especially in the support industries to create manufacturing facilities.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>25 YEARS</h4><p>Interface has been in the Middle East for more than 25 years, and we have always been based in Dubai. However, six years ago we opened our regional head office here and at the same time built a much larger team of people in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE.</p><h4>SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS</h4><p>As we are a global leader in the design and production of carpet tiles, we have manufacturing plants from the US to Asia. In 1995, Interface became one of the first companies to publicly commit to doing business in a more sustainable way.</p><h4>THE MATERIALS USED</h4><p>In terms of sustainable buildings, probably the biggest impact you can have in this region is in the consumption of energy and water, which seems to be what everyone is focusing on. However, the materials that are used in a building also have a huge effect.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>HUMBLE BEGINNINGS</h4><p>The first imports the company made were back in 1993. We imported the first materials for $15,000. At the end, in the brokerage business you do not make much money—just enough to survive. We then started importing materials. We spoke with suppliers and asked to supply materials on a consignment basis. I sold the materials then passed the proceeds back to them. That was how we built the business.</p><h4>AFTER THE CRISIS</h4><p>Because we were present in so many countries, business in different markets was barely affected, and that allowed us to bounce back very quickly. Our business increased by 25% between 2010 and 2011. We are expecting another 25% growth this year.</p><h4>GOALS</h4><p>Our goal is always to expand. We want to open more and more stores. We have 33 stores at the moment. By next year we want to have 50 stores in total. We want to open a new store every two months.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PUMP IT UP</h4><p>The team that manages Emirates Beton has been in the industry for over 20 years. We have, as a team, gained valuable technical experience in the business of producing high-performance concrete and in pumping it for high-rise projects.</p><h4>RECORD BREAKERS</h4><p>I have been involved in projects such as the Maktoum Bridge, Wafi, Grand Hyatt, Shangri-La, the Burj Al Arab hotel, Emirates Towers, Jumeirah Beach Hotel, and City of Arabia—which are all famous landmarks—and most importantly the Burj Khalifa, where we surpassed the previous world record for high-rise pumping.</p><h4>TOP QUALITY</h4><p>Corrosion is a very predominant factor in this region, which is enhanced by the ground water and environmental conditions. There are windblown salts as well, and so the quality of the concrete here has to be exceptionally good</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE IDEAL CHOICE</h4><p>Our business aims to build close ties to the consumers in order to anticipate their needs and understand their tastes. DuBiotech was the ideal choice for IFF, with incredible infrastructure that is unique in the region.</p><h4>THE ADVANTAGES</h4><p>The buildings in DuBiotech provide the infrastructure we needed, as it is very important for us to have access to a clean and sterile air flow. We change the air eight times per hour for the purposing of evaluating fragrances. The air must be clean to carry out this process.</p><h4>THE PRODUCT</h4><p>As a flavor and fragrance company, we cater to  many industries in Dubai. The region is very diverse. Flavor-wise, we develop sweet flavors for products such as juices and snacks; scent-wise we cover everything from personal care to home care and fine and beauty care.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>HOME SWEET HOME</h4><p>Dubai has been extremely welcoming with the free zone legislation in general, and DuBiotech was the natural choice. When we arrived we were an under-resourced company with only three people, and today we are 40 people. DuBiotech actively advised us from the start, facilitated the journey of creating the legal entity and helped us where we lacked experience.</p><h4>THAT GROWTH</h4><p>The Middle East in general is a very attractive place today. Maquet's global revenue generally is driven out of Latin America, Singapore, the Middle East, India, and China. Just to put things in perspective, in four years we have grown our revenue from $7 million to close to $90 million.</p><h4>ROOTS</h4><p>Our initial roots were in medical furniture. Then we evolved into therapy over the course of 180 years. We are trying to transform our business into a therapeutic company that is focused on better patient outcomes, and we took this direction with the acquisition of Siemens Life Support Division in 2003.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>CREATION</h4><p>The creation of DuBiotech was announced in 2005 by UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum. The vision was for Dubai to be a hub for the life sciences industry and to encourage research in this area.</p><h4>ON TRACK</h4><p>To date we have delivered two projects, the first being the laboratory building and the second the warehousing complex. The goal that we are working toward now is to attract multinationals and companies that have products ready to access the market immediately.</p><h4>EXTRA SUPPORT</h4><p>Many companies have really innovative technologies that they want to bring to the market, and to build a presence they need support from the Ministry of Health and other authorities. We bridge the gap between the government and the wider industry to advise the government and support its understanding of new technologies.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The acquisition was made in 2008 and we were obligated to make Mapfre Atlas follow the same business model that Mapfre uses around the world. Atlas was a very solvent company, but too corporate oriented and too heavily focused on Guayaquil. The challenge was to implement the Mapfre model, which has a more national scope; we are interested in doing business across the country and expanding our product lines, not just in corporate products, but also in individual insurance. We are also working to diversify our sales channels. The main points of sale were our brokers. We have maintained these brokers, and are expanding their numbers, but we also wanted to make agreements with banks and other entities. In terms of corporate culture, we have adopted a code and the staff has gladly accepted the changes, seeing them as beneficial. Ecuador, from an insurance point of view, and considering other economic indices, ranks in the middle of Latin American countries. For a market that is valued at approximately $1.3 billion, there are a lot of insurance companies present.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Equivida belongs to GrupoFuturo, a holding company. It was launched in the 1970s as an insurance broker. Later, the group gave birth to Seguros Equinoccial, which operated all the insurance lines. In 1994 Grupo Futuro decided to form two new companies. One was Salud S.A., a prepaid healthcare firm; and the second was Equivida, an insurance and reinsurance firm. The latter was geared toward taking care of all types of personal risks, but mainly life and personal accidents insurance. Nowadays, Seguros Equinoccial works only in non-life insurance. Personal life insurance's share in our portfolio increased from 4% in 2008 to 13% in 2011. We have grown at a rate of 58% every year and expect to end 2012 with a 20% share. Our main target here is the middle class, and there is definitely great potential for growth because economic development has resulted in a middle class with higher purchasing power. However, corporate insurance is still very important for Equivida.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Panamericana had been a very conservative company throughout its history. Since I started with the company, Panamericana has changed dramatically. I started working in a more aggressive and commercial way, with the goal of re-entering the market. Currently, we are aiming to provide our brokers with an excellent service at an unbeatable price. We started this program three years ago. The company began working with quality processes in 2012, after one year of study and research. We have undertaken the never-ending project of improving our services, and the company has taken a protagonist stance within the market. Recently, we have decided to make a huge advancement by investing heavily in technology. Something exciting will happen, but it won't hit the market until late in 2012. We are working on several products. We are not attempting to cover the whole market, and instead emphasize coverage for certain groups. For example, right now we are developing a product that's a mix between insurance and assistance services for the elderly.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The purpose of our services, products, and company is to save time for people that analyze the figures of the insurance market in Ecuador and 18 additional countries in Latin America. We gather published material and the financial records that these countries publish. We then make it available on the internet for our users, which are mainly global and regional insurance companies. We are a niche company that offers a subscription for our services. Over the past decade, we have visited almost every country and insurance company we work with, and our subscribers recognize the value of our newsletter and services. We participate in many insurance association events from year to year, such as the Inter American Federation of Insurers (FIDES) Conference. We have gotten to know the countries, executives, and needs of each country. Over the last couple of years, we have also been generating country reports, as well as a line of business reports related to insurance. Our customers appreciate the way in which we offer an idea of current activity so they can make better decisions.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The single most important reason behind our success is that we have the finest workshops in the world as well as the world's largest VW workshop. The company has one of the largest Porsche workshops in the world, and we are in the process of building the world's largest Audi showroom, which will have five floors. The only way you can sell a high-ticket car is to invest in facilities. We are the world's largest Porsche dealer—no other dealer comes close to us. Our firm is just starting the design for the new Porsche center. We are the agents for Dubai and the Northern Emirates. From Dubai, Fujairah, and Sharjah, we reach all our markets. People who have the money to buy our type of cars will always have money. Some customers  deferred purchases during the global financial crisis, but sales always pick up. For VW, which represents our mid-range segment, what happened was many people left during the recession. They then all started coming back. We are back now to figures we had in 2007-2008. Most of our customers hold onto their cars for between three and five years. The company is also very active in the secondhand car market. Monthly, we sell 20-25 used Porches and 50-60 used Audis. We sell what we get in, but we do not get a lot of used cars to sell.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Looking at UAE vehicle sales in 2011 up to and including August, we can see that MPVs—or multi-purpose vehicles—represent the fastest growing segment in the UAE market, witnessing 24% growth. However, this a relatively small segment of the overall UAE automotive “car park.“ More interesting to note is the 12% growth in the luxury car segment, which itself gives a strong indication that consumer confidence is returning to the UAE. Light commercial vehicle (LCV) sales are witnessing growth of 12%, and the traditionally dominant passenger car and SUV segments are continuing to grow, albeit at lower digit growth rates of 3% and 2%, respectively. The total GCC car market is up just 1% in 2011, and the UAE car market is up 10%, but Arabian Automobiles' sales growth across the Nissan product range is up 35%, and we take great pride in having outperformed the UAE car market by more than three fold. During the boom years, business came to us without the need for marketing. There is no substitute for developing an organization based on best practices. We need to have the IT to enable the business to function at the highest levels in an automated fashion. Our people need to be educated to deliver the best performance to more than 180 nationalities living in Dubai. The company has to get the basics right to achieve customer satisfaction and customer retention.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Galadari Automobiles has over 35 years of history within the UAE market, so it is one of the oldest automotive distributors in the local market. It has also had a distribution agreement with Mazda for 35 years, making it one of Mazda's oldest partners in the region. The market has changed from basically a seller's to a buyer's market. Customers want a pro-active approach and proper follow-up. They want proper professional treatment. The customer now has plenty of choices. He will browse around in the showrooms looking for the best offer, and it is not only about the car and the package, it is also about the treatment he receives. Our aim is to give personalized treatment to our customers. It is not an easy task because of the different nationalities we have in Dubai. Everybody has his own perception of how he wants to get treated, so it is difficult in this kind of environment. But we are looking forward to fulfilling these kinds of objectives. Of course, service is one of the key factors because the sales executives are getting trained to sell the cars, and increased customer loyalty or the retention ratio comes from the service. If the customer is satisfied with our service then maybe he will consider Mazda for the next purchase or recommend us to a friend. Therefore, we are really focusing on the service side to treat the customer in a different and more personalized way.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH</h4><p>Steel is very important in many countries, but owing to the fast development of the UAE, the demand for structural steel is exceptionally high here. At the moment, we are focused on steel building materials for industrial, oil and gas, water, and power facilities.</p><h4>ADDING &amp; EXPORTING</h4><p>Most of the material we use is imported from Western Europe and Asia, particularly Korea and Japan. We engineer, manufacture, and add value to this material in Dubai in order to prepare it for the local market or export it to other countries.</p><h4>POSITIVE &amp; CHALLENGING</h4><p>We have almost reached the maximum capacity of our factory, and we need to maintain our strengths to win more projects. Currently, we are finalizing contracts in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as well as in Abu Dhabi. I am very positive about 2012, but it will not be an easy year.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MEASURABLE ACHIEVEMENTS</h4><p>Ducab started by producing simple low voltage cables for construction, but now produces the full range of  low, medium, high, and extra-high voltage products. Also, we now produce our own copper rods and PVC and employ over 1,200 people at our sites in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p><h4>MOST SIGNIFICANT</h4><p>Regarding the markets that we focus on, the domestic sector is the most significant. We own a market share of between 35% and 65%, depending on the product. We are also strong in regional markets.</p><h4>STRONG COMMITMENTS</h4><p>In 2010 we announced a 50% growth rate and in 2011 a rate of almost 40%. I think it is the commitment of the management team, as well as the whole staff, looking to provide quality of service to clients and customers.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>CHASING OPPORTUNITIES</h4><p>A priority for Gulf Cryo is to continue to expand our regional footprint from one border to the next, reinforcing our regional competitiveness as well as defending established territories. We will be proactive in chasing opportunities and continue to build and maintain our product portfolio.</p><h4>STRATEGIC APPROACH</h4><p>In terms of our strategic approach, we know our core strength is in bulk and packaged gas product lines, and we know the regional economies are driven by the oil and gas sector and government infrastructure projects, so naturally these are areas to concentrate on.</p><h4>ONE-STOP SHOP</h4><p>We are building up new capacities to improve our product availability for air gases, CO2, and hydrogen, and also expanding our packaged gases distribution points in our existing markets. We are more and more a one-stop shop when it comes to industrial and medical gases and their related services.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Considering GM's 100-year history and where we will be in the next century, emerging markets are the driver of growth in the automotive industry. Currently, over 60% of our sales are completed outside of North America, and going forward we seek to further strengthen our position in the Middle East. The Middle East is set to grow faster than most regions in the world over the next decade. We are forecasting that total industry vehicles sales in the Middle East will grow from about 1.15 million units in 2011 to 2.1 million units by the end of the decade—reflecting approximately 85% growth. This would make the Middle East one of the world's fastest growing automotive markets outside the BRIC countries of Brazil, Russia, India, and China. This is due to the positive economic outlook for the region, particularly due to strengthening oil prices, and favorable demographics. Educational levels are increasing, the middle class is expanding, and about 60% of the population is under the age of 25. These elements are very beneficial for the automobile business. Many consumers are buying their first car, and a variety of others are upgrading to larger and more expensive vehicles. With our portfolio of brands and models, we are able to sell vehicles to meet all these needs and wants—from entry-level to luxury cars. GM's portfolio in the Middle East reflects that with Chevrolet, GMC, and Cadillac all positioned for growth.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>GE has been in the region for over 80 years. We started operations by supporting the oil and gas sector in power generation. People know us as what we used to be, an appliance company. There is a lot that the Middle East region has had to offer, particularly Dubai. Over the years we have found new ways to strengthen our relationships and partnerships. Just look at the region's growth—over the last 30 years, Dubai has transformed dramatically. Though it has limited natural resources, the city wanted to monetize these resources for infrastructure development. First, Dubai built a very strong infrastructure network to help improve people's lives with electricity, clean water, and transportation systems. Second, Dubai used this monetization to build good healthcare and education systems. Third, Dubai knew that its energy resources were limited, and it wanted to diversify its economy industrially. Finally, Dubai wanted to stimulate tourism by offering many support systems. GE also has strong business functions as an oil and gas company, and we were in a position to help monetize the region's natural resources. We're a power generation company, a water company, and a transportation company with aviation and even rail. We're also a healthcare company. Dubai's vision and what GE has to offer matches perfectly. That's why we increased our presence to suit the region's needs.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We have been in the region for more than 50 years, and we truly believe in the potential of Dubai and the UAE as a market, and even more as a regional hub for Philips in the Middle East. We manage 14 countries from our regional headquarters in Dubai, focused on diversified businesses such as health care, consumer lifestyle, and lighting. We also see Dubai as a gateway to expansion into other parts of the region, as the Emirate enjoys a neutral position, representing “the Switzerland“ of the Middle East. It is also well equipped to serve different areas. The Emirate is progressive and innovative in its approach to business and growth. This attracts companies such as Philips, which centers its efforts on meaningful innovation. We also have regional hubs in Beirut, Riyadh, and Istanbul. These bases all fall under the umbrella of Dubai. At its core, Philips is focused on innovation, and Dubai offers the perfect combination of innovation and location, aligned with development in the region and the UAE. Dubai is very adept at embracing innovative approaches. The healthcare system works toward the application of the latest technology and the sharing of knowledge. For example, the Saudi German Hospital, a recently built leading hospital in Dubai, is a facility that is fully equipped with Philips' technology and innovations. We bring in our global knowledge and experience.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, the banking industry in our region has changed significantly, especially when it comes to the high-net-worth (HNW) individual sector. First of all, the number of HNW individuals in the region increased dramatically over the past decade. The amount of wealth that is held by HNW individuals in regional terms has also increased. Many of the regional commercial banks have started paying attention to these facts and developed private banking platforms to cater to HNW individuals. The international banks covered the region for many years with suitcase bankers. However, in recent years they have set up offices with teams of bankers on the ground. Bahrain used to be the hub of the offshore industry, but now the DIFC seems to have taken the lead and has attracted a larger number of banks to the region. We work to offer a service that is similar in terms of quality to an international private banking boutique. However, we book the business locally and are committed to a long-term presence with local understanding. These things set us apart from the international banks. We have our own custody platform through which assets are booked, while if the client works with international banks the money would need to be sent overseas to international booking centers based in jurisdictions such as Switzerland, the UK, or even Singapore.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In private banking, size matters in the sense that the world has become increasingly complicated. IT capabilities, controlling, and reporting are much more expensive and complex. Financial markets have become more complex, and with globalization a bank has to be much more active on the markets, not just in Europe but in Asia as well. To have the capacity to handle this, a bank needs to be a certain size and have the right knowledge and people to preserve and capture wealth, and of course always be aware of how the environment is changing. There are a combination of factors to consider when deciding who you can really trust with your wealth. We have to be very active, and we are doing that through sophisticated IT management. We have developed our own tools, which we manage entirely internally for ultimate security. The banks' internal systems have historically been closed, but we have opened them up to our clients. Even if we ultimately make the decisions, the client can always check in on what is going on. It is not a trading platform, but a very sophisticated asset management platform, recognized as one of the best in Switzerland. So the first step for us was ease of access to information, and with that came the need for greater client involvement on our part.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our core focus is private banking because we are a Swiss private bank. Our tag line is “Sustainable Swiss private banking since 1841,“ and especially in today's times this motto has really helped us grow our business and gain client confidence. In addition to the conventional private banking offering, we have expanded our offering in the last year by launching family office services as well as a comprehensive Islamic wealth management offering for our clients. In addition, we also provide value-added services to our clients via our associate Alpen Capital, which provides investment banking advisory services. I feel this model really works as the investment banking advisory business of Alpen Capital adds value to the private banking business of Sarasin-Alpen. We have a comprehensive Islamic Wealth Management platform based on sharia principles. We also have our very own Sharia Board that is responsible for reviewing and monitoring our Islamic offering. It is an essential offering, as many of our Arab clients, who form 70-80% of our customer base, often want a sharia-compliant structure. We launched our services based on extensive client demand and we are one of the only Swiss private banks to have such a comprehensive offering.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Overall, 2011 was a very interesting year. It started out very well but then came to a halt very quickly when the Arab Spring affected the whole MENA region. The combination of the Arab Spring and the international economic situation made it extremely difficult for players in the UAE to access international debt capital markets. The challenging times in the market resulted in six or so months of inactivity in the region. It wasn't until the Abu Dhabi-based company IPIC decided to pursue some significant debt capital market transactions that other entities in the region decided to follow suit. So far, 2012 has been an interesting year. The variety of financial instruments that have come onto the market this year has demonstrated that there is a large appetite for debt and sukuk instruments in the region. It is now clear that the Emirate plays a crucial role in debt capital markets simply because the vast majority of players that operate in the sector—not the debt issuers, but the banks, the lawyers, advisors, and traders—are all based in Dubai.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>As a first step in pursuing our regional expansion plans, we chose the UAE on the basis of its status as a world-class regional hub with a robust regulatory structure offering an efficient and straightforward business environment. Being a dedicated MENA investment bank, on-the-ground presence in key markets was a necessity, not an option, and we needed a regional platform with international standards that would enable us to attract global and regional talents and for that the UAE was our premier choice. Of course, having a robust financial and logistical infrastructure and a favorable time zone, with among the most convenient and modern travel infrastructure in the region, allowed the UAE to be the trade and merchants hub for the region, and we were eager to be part of that.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Investors will pay a premium for companies that have good disclosure in this region. And we know there is a problem when people globally do not trust the information. Over the last three to four years we have started to see a positive change in this region. However, many companies do not fully understand the benefits of transparency, and so there is a long way to go. Still, if we look at how far we have come in terms of transparency in the last three to four years, there really has been a shift. Another problem was that, back in 2008 with the financial crisis, most of the companies coming into the region were hedge funds. So as soon as the crisis hit, this fast money left, driving the market down further. The repercussion was that for the next two to three years companies perceived foreign investors as more trouble than they were worth—not fully comprehending that by taking control of the investor relations function they could attract longer-term value and growth-driven investors.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>We officially set up our offices here in February 2008 after a history of running the business out of London. Our business model is to look after institutional money, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and foundations. The significance, therefore, of Dubai, is the strength of domestic opportunity. The other part of the distribution business is looking after the wealth of individuals, and Dubai offers the best opportunities in the region. Approximately 90% of wealth and assets in the broader Middle East sit in the GCC. Within that space, there is a real focus around Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Bahrain. Qatar and Oman are also significant, but from a regulatory perspective, this was the best choice. This is because of the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). It is a regulatory framework that everyone is aware of, and it is very easy for us as a foreign organization to operate here. Our expansion plans are always just around working with our clients to grow assets and look after them.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>In terms of insurance, Dubai has possibly the most potential within the Gulf. If you compare Dubai as an emirate against other cities in Saudi Arabia that are quite large, like Khobar, Riyadh, and Jeddah, I would say Dubai has the largest mix of companies. The UAE is the most advanced in terms of the population and insurance uptake. Dubai is therefore a very competitive market. There are close to 60 companies operating here, and 160 registered brokers in the small market. New large players are coming to the market, such as the likes of Zurich, which is going to have an impact in terms of the competition in 2012. The biggest potential lies in health care. In Abu Dhabi, healthcare coverage is compulsory. In Dubai and other Emirates, it is non-compulsory, but it is going to become compulsory in the next couple of years. It may happen this year or the next, but it is bound to happen. And most companies have started to move toward offering healthcare benefits to their employees as the norm. There is also potential in terms of marine insurance, and AXA is primarily very strong in the area within the Middle East. The motor market has always been very competitive, but again there is growth potential depending on the costs, and there has been much improvement in 2011 compared to 2010.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our focus when we started in terms of medical and life insurance was on the local community. However, expatriates comprise a big percentage of the population here in the UAE, and you cannot ignore that this is mainly an expatriate market. If an expatriate is in Dubai this year, he/she might be in Qatar the next year, or in the UK the next. We wanted to be able to offer a policy that they could take anywhere in the world, with the same coverage. This was why we entered into a partnership with William Russell, and at the same time, we wanted it to be tied to the rebranding exercise that we did. We therefore told the market that we were rebranding, enhancing the image, as well as catering to certain classes of business that we would not otherwise be able to service without the partnerships. We have very specialized products that we are offering to the banking sector now. We have structured a product that is designed to help banks offer loans and financing in an easier and cheaper way. This is a very well-established and mature product in Europe, but in the GCC I think we are the first company to offer this sort of product.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are predominantly in corporate insurance, but increasingly we're looking at the consumer space as well, including homeowners, personal accidents, and lifestyle products. We have large plans for all three. We are the leader in financial lines and directors in office insurance, for example. However, we are continuing our efforts in educating the markets. We spend time developing the market by holding seminars and publicizing novel insurance products. Chartis is a pioneer in terms of distribution innovations. The company aims to continue strengthening its relationships with brokers in the market. There is no doubt that brokers play a very important role. We have conducted a variety of research and market reviews, and the company has identified pockets of customer bases that are interested in online shopping. This is something we are looking to develop through our call center. As a retail-oriented country, there may be an opportunity to position insurance as a retail product. This is another type of distribution innovation. On the sales side of products, we see a need for a customer-oriented product. The incumbents have not refined the product to fit different income groups and national groups. We're looking to brand insurance offerings both insurance wise and product wise in a way that fits specific segments. There's another huge opportunity in terms of customer experience, which is largely underdeveloped.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The insurance market is consolidated at the country level—and the UAE is the largest insurance market in the region in close competition with Saudi Arabia, which had tremendous growth in the last few years. Dubai is in the top range of insurance penetration per capita when we compare it to other countries in the region. The market has evolved immensely over the last decade. In the late 1990s most health treatment was funded by the public sector. Governments became more and more aware of increasing health costs and inflation, and sought to shift the funding of healthcare  to the private sector. Many governments in the region made the decision during the mid-2000s, and introduced mandatory health  insurance. Coupled with this move, employers wanted to offer more and more benefits to their staff and many companies are now providing medical insurance. We have seen double-digit to triple-digit growth in the past three or four years, and now about 80% of the population is insured. We don't consider the market totally saturated yet; there is still room for new products and ideas. There is definitely new business coming in as the new numbers of people arriving to this country are still very high. We are currently managing 4 million claims annually amounting to $550 million.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Dubai was built as a regional hub rather than a local economy. Our place of work is Dubai, where we enjoy a nice lifestyle in a fairly open society, with the proper infrastructure and political stability. Companies are based here, but many conduct business outside of the Emirate. For example, this is the regional office for the Middle East and Africa, and Dubai is just one of the markets in which we operate. Some of our primary markets abroad are Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Kenya, and Tanzania. We're also moving into South Africa, Uganda, Zimbabwe, and North Africa in the future. Looking at the neighborhood, other options could include Lebanon and Saudi Arabia, but these countries have drawbacks, such as occasional political strife, size, and lack of dedicated resources. From an expatriate perspective, and as an international investor, Dubai is more comfortable. It is crucial to attract the best people who can manage businesses successfully, and if we can't attract high-caliber staff, it will be difficult to protect our investments. Dubai attracts people, especially when comparing it to the rest of the neighborhood and region. Currently, the UAE is home to the largest insurance market in the Middle East. We're projected to close at about $6 billion in 2012 for some 5 million people. The market is even larger than in Saudi Arabia, where forecasts predict $4 billion of premiums for a population of 25 million.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have been very active in the last couple of years with many concerts, events, publications, and getting all the stakeholders together, raising awareness, engaging with different partners.Basically, that has helped to push the country in the right direction. One of our core functions is being a forum, and that means that we are a group of people with lots of knowledge in different areas of green buildings, which can help our stakeholders in making sure that we get to the goals much more effectively than if we were doing it on our own, so to speak. The membership is reflected by the whole building supply chain, from the person that finances it to the banks and lawyers involved in structuring operations. There are also the actual developers themselves, the consultants that design it, the contractors that build it, the material suppliers, and then the owners and operators. This is the entire supply chain, and members and expertise represent every level.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Our primary field is engineering. I am a mechanical engineer, and most of my staff members are engineers and LEED Professionals. We take a subject and work on reducing as much energy from it as we can. The backbone of the company is engineering, and then we have the LEED System. Water and electricity are about 60% of any given building's inputs, and most of it is mechanical and electrical engineering. That is why we are successful in green buildings. Energy and water are the ingredients of a building. LEED is a simple way of making a building. It quantifies elements of the building and gives you a quick and easy way to assemble it optimally. We did this for a long time, and the US Green Building Council asked us to develop education programs. That's the third aspect. We also conduct LEED Education Programs. We teach mostly engineers, architects, NGOs, product suppliers, and those involved in the building industry, the fundamentals, and how to achieve green buildings. That is the first course, and there are also more advanced courses. These three business units are interrelated.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>When we began this carbon-based biogas program in 1985, we understood the potential of the technology. We developed a portable, family-sized domestic plant, which worked without the use of carbon and was utilized to manage the organic waste generated within the household. Gradually, we have made the technology more efficient and made it suitable for any institution that is generating waste. At both the institutional and domestic levels, the gas generated through this technology can be utilized to replace cooking fuels. On a larger scale it can be utilized for generating power. Another advantage of this technology is its ability to handle organic waste, whereas other waste management systems can only handle sorted waste. Through the bio-management process we can produce three by-products: energy, liquid fertilizer, and solid fertilizer. The technology hygienically disposes of the waste, producing energy and fertilizer, and in addition, it contributes to protecting the environment from carbon emissions, because methane gas is generated through the breaking down of waste.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>When we started our business, we looked at the energy efficiency of existing buildings. We would go into a building and see where energy was being used but did not deliver a service; it was effectively an energy audit. We would tell the clients that we can save them 25% off their energy bills. They can then use their savings to pay us back for the investment we will make. Obviously, it will be two or three years before the client pays the full amount back, just like a bank service. The clients end up extremely happy. Around 19 years ago, electricity was much cheaper, but now everybody wants to save on energy costs. One thing then led to another. We started with some big projects, such as the Trade Center and Terminal 2 at the airport in Dubai. Then, one day, a client questioned why we weren't involved in projects at the building stage, instead of implementing our technology later on. As a result, we opened another service called Energy Value Analysis (EVA). Basically, EVA overlooks the energy designs of the consultants from the energy point of view from the design stage.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>One of the things Nokia is focusing on is being a local company. The introduction of the Customs Union with Russia and Belarus made us local in the sense that we work with our partners more closely. We have localized our products for Kazakhstan and expanded our offices here, and we are the official mobile phone of the Asian Games. At the same time, our base in Kazakhstan allows us to serve other markets in the southern CIS. We have gained much experience in this market, and have increased our retail sales. Consumers are demanding our products and we are providing them the best quality. We are cooperating with local operators and have launched various campaigns to bring new products to consumers. Regarding value-added services, there's definitely a significant amount of demand coming from consumers. The market is moving away from inexpensive devices toward smartphones. People are following the trends in Western Europe and are demanding the same products.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>People didn't used to worry about saving energy, but in the last five years the rising awareness has become significant. Now, more customers are concerned about energy usage, and Alsi sells the latest in technology to help clients save money. We are aiming to develop software platforms and customize them for local needs. The problem is that many customers have never seen such improvements in efficiency, and so we provide examples on how they can use this technology. We are organizing some classes for our customers in order to demonstrate our IT infrastructure. We don't interact very much with local providers because we develop for ourselves, and because it's more relevant to work with the local representative offices of international brands that promote best practices. This is because we want to attract new customers and keep them. In Kazakhstan, there is little interaction between competitors, and as a result this community of companies is not consolidated.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>If you have been to Astana, your plane landed on the runway using our lights. We have provided complete airfield lighting solutions for Aktobe and Pavlodar airports and several helicopter landing pads. We have many references in the telecommunications sector, such as supplying the railway station in Astana with information systems and LED solutions, supplying a Philips display to a 30,000-seat stadium in Astana, a speed skating arena in Astana, and many other sports facilities. Our task is not just to sell, but also to provide the right solution for the customer. We have also taken an active part in the reconstruction of sports venues, such as the Sport Palace of Baluan Sholak, to which we supplied and installed a professional lighting system and LED screens, as well as control and ticketing systems and a fantastic architectural lighting solution. We have equipped 13 of Kazakhstan's airports with high-technology aviation weather systems, which give real-time weather data in airports for the pilots of all types of planes.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Our profit goals are a little less ambitious than our competitors. However, we are a profitable company delivering significant returns to our shareholders. We are a very cost-conscious company that monitors costs at every level. We do not have many employees in our company, and we don't spend much of our budget on advertising. However, we promote our products in combination with attractive tariffs to inspire people to buy our services and products. That is how we offer lower prices and maintain the same margins as our competitors. I believe our prices are 30%-40% lower than they were in 2010. Our customers are happy, and our competitors find it very difficult to answer to us. The competition has to choose between losing customers who seek low-cost options, or lowering their prices and losing revenue. As the competition faces this dilemma, we enjoy comfortable business conditions. In 2011, every operator introduced 3G in Kazakhstan. There was a high demand for this technology and its release was well met by customers.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We closely monitor the movements of other airline companies and market developments and analyze the fares offered. We try to establish a balance between our competitors' fares and our current price structure, and determine the best fit for our strategy. Our prices differ from the low to middle range or a little higher; it depends on the destination. Besides this, we strive for an operational fit, meaning our flight schedule should balance with market demand. The nature of Kazakhstani traffic is mostly business-related, and the average Kazakhstani travels to Turkey or Asia for tourism. With further developments in the tourism segment, Kazakhstan has large potential to attract foreign leisure travelers as well. I see huge progress in Kazakhstan, but there are obstacles to overcome, such as the development of Almaty International Airport. The current airport is not large enough and it is rapidly reaching its growth limits. The new terminal has been partly built, but construction needs to accelerate and catch up with the country's development, rather than hamper its evolution. This means that more complete infrastructure should be in place. Infrastructure is very important for the country's development and also for the airline industry, and I believe that the authorities should not hesitate in developing the airport and its surroundings further.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Prime Aviation is fully incorporated in Kazakhstan, where we operate on behalf of a number of high-net-worth (HNW) individuals and two charter aircraft that support the oil industry. On a secondary basis, we hold an operator certificate that supports our customers seeking air transport services out of Almaty or Kazakhstan. Part of our fleet is privately managed and geared toward a number of HNW individuals, and we perform aircraft maintenance on their behalf. We ensure that the crew and engineers are trained, the aircraft is serviceable, and that all the documentation is up to date. Our customers first choose the size of the aircraft desired, and then we begin our calculations. After the core costs are assessed, we ask where the customer wants to fly. For example, flying to Astana is much cheaper than to Moscow. This is because in Moscow everything takes place in business airports, and customers have limited choices. From there, we begin to assess other costs. Going to Astana accrues a smaller cost, whereas flying to Moscow is less affordable. We ask, and the customers tell us what they want; for food, we could serve a sandwich or caviar. Prime Aviation also offers a standard package with set costs. We also consider time a factor, and how long the customers will be away. The number of passengers is also up to the customer, who can choose between nine and 13 travelers on each aircraft.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Eurocopter's achievements over the last 20 years are remarkable: the company owns the largest market share worldwide in the civilian and para-public market, which is 43%. In addition, the company has the largest range of helicopters. Innovation is at the heart of Eurocopter's culture, and 13 models were launched or completely modernized over the last 20 years. We are currently working on several very innovative products, such as the EC175, X3, and X4. These will mark a distinctive breakthrough in the helicopter industry. Eurocopter is also able to meet the challenges of very different customer groups and offer solutions suitable to their demands. Eurocopter Kazakhstan Engineering is an integrated part of the overall Eurocopter network, and can rely on the knowledge available in the main plants, subsidiaries, and participants. Meanwhile, it is becoming the Central Asian hub of the company. We will offer support for Kazakhstani EC145 customers and training for pilots and experts. We will also assemble the EC145 helicopters for Kazakhstan at our plant in Astana, with personnel from Kazakhstan. Our aim is to gradually increase the knowledge about this helicopter among our experts so that they can serve our customers as well as our German or French staff can. We have already begun training the first mechanical and aviation experts, and the company plans to achieve this goal through cooperation with its German staff.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUPPLY CHAIN</h4><p>We started the distribution and marketing of pharmaceutical products in 1999 with only one supplier and we have distributed to hospitals, pharmacies, and sub-distributers. Now, Viva Pharm has 25 suppliers and 25 partners, and it represents them here in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>THE BALANCE</h4><p>Prescription drugs account for 80% of our total production, and 20% are over-the-counter drugs. In terms of supply to big companies, the ratio is 50/50. The retail market is growing, and it's bigger than the hospital market.</p><h4>THE PROCESS</h4><p>Outside the country we distribute big-branded products because we have to register our local products. It's a long process that can take over a year. In the production business, you have to decide what you are going to sell three or five years down the line, as you need to produce, test, and submit the product to the Ministry of Health.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>COMING ALIVE</h4><p>The pharmaceutical industry in Kazakhstan was in its infancy 10 to 12 years ago, but now the country is particularly active in increasing the production of generic products for domestic and regional markets.</p><h4>IN THE UNION</h4><p>The Customs Union gives advantages to plants working under Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). From 2014 onward, a company that acquires GMP accreditation will be able to sell its products in the Belarus and Russian markets and participate in state tenders.</p><h4>CLIMATE</h4><p>Overall, Kazakhstan has a favorable investment climate. The country is taking the necessary measures to raise the standards for local manufacturers, which have to comply with GMP standards in order to compete in the local market.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>IN THE GAME</h4><p>Pfizer is committed to health improvement for millions of Kazakhstani citizens by providing access to safe and effective medicines and related healthcare services. Due to our efforts, not only well-known drugs, but the most comprehensive scientific developments became available for Kazakhstani patients.</p><h4>A GOOD EXAMPLE</h4><p>The Kazakhstani market is characterized by political stability and a favorable investment climate. In addition, the pharma market in the country is in the process of becoming more organized, transparent, and accessible than elsewhere in Central Asia.</p><h4>DEVELOPMENT POINTS</h4><p>We have already observed substantial improvements in the pharmaceuticals sector, such as clearly developed regulations for registering pharmaceuticals, the medical products advertising law, and advanced legislation on clinical trials.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BRINGING IN THE KNOW-HOW</h4><p>We brought in a large amount of know-how and professional staff to the country, and educated our local doctors and nurses abroad. Now, the company has become a leader in providing private medical services and it is a leader in many medical sectors.</p><h4>THE CENTER</h4><p>To begin with, I established the Center of Israel Medicine. As a doctor, the company was within my knowledge. There was very good technology in the private medical sector in Israel, and I aimed to implement it in Kazakhstan. The Center of Israel Medicine is a very professional private medical center, and one of the first of its kind in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>TIPS FROM THE TOP</h4><p>When investors arrive, they establish a presence in the country, open an office, invest money, and operate and manage a business. Only then can companies begin expanding. It is no longer possible to take intermediary steps. Therefore, the greatest opportunities are in the diversification of businesses; shifting from raw materials to develop high technology.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Our clients pay a lot of attention to a car model's year of production. In 2012, the 2011 model is already perceived as old. Furthermore, they are not interested in fuel consumption and engine specifications. What seems to have the biggest influence on their decision is word of mouth and the opinions of their peers. We use print media to educate the public and to inform them about what characteristics consumers should look for while buying their cars. Our message is simple; we are a good company with excellent products and service. We are building our maintenance capacity for hybrid cars, which requires a completely different skill set and facilities. We had five Porches with hybrid motors delivered to Kazakhstan, and only after that did we start working with such vehicles. At the moment, they are just expensive toys that a limited number of people can afford. We do not see a mass demand for hybrid vehicles. As the technology develops and hybrid styles become more affordable, we will see more demand for these vehicles.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>The relationships Renault has with its corporate clients are very well established. French companies, pharmaceutical companies, and food companies especially like our cars. Additionally, we are attracting more corporate clients from different sectors. Renault employs a very flexible pricing policy; corporate clients enjoy discounts. Our business, including our high-quality and favorable terms, is spread between existing and potential corporate clients as we enlarge our company. Our retail sales are also increasing year by year, which is very pleasing. We import cars upon receipt of an advance payment of 10%-15% of the value of the car. In terms of volumes, we are bringing in some 200 vehicles per month. As for price, our SUV is in the range of $18,000-$25,000, in which there are no competitors. In 2011 we sold about 300 cars, though in 2012 we are planning to sell 1,200 cars; 100 each month. Additional financing instruments like our deal with Nurbank will help us increase sales in 2012. In 2011, we had a limited range of models on sale, which we have increased over the past year.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Toyota's strongest point is customer satisfaction and care. The product needs to be reliable, and it should provide customers with safety and comfort. If it doesn't work it damages the brand. The second factor is to make customers feel comfortable during the selling process. Also, after-sales services are crucial to give our customers complete satisfaction. Thirdly, service quality, treatment, and transparency in prices contribute to customer trust. Another important aspect is marketing. In 2010, we didn't do a lot of marketing as supply was limited and we did not need marketing to sell, as the demand was there. However, if we want to double our sales we will need more pro-active and customer-oriented marketing activities, not only through mediums such as billboards, the internet, and radio, but we need to perform more data-based marketing. Toyota  likes to enjoy a very close relationship with its customers. While some brands focus only on sales, buying a Toyota means life-long service. This is our philosophy.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>RMA is a global company with roots in Southeast Asia. We began life as a specialist company modifying vehicles, but are now active in a number of areas including automotive, heavy equipment, power generation products, financial services, and even food services. Today, RMA operates engineering and automotive modification centers in Thailand, Indonesia, South Africa, and Turkey, where we process vehicles directly from the manufacturers and engineer them to specific requirements. For example, in Turkey, we are making ambulances from the popular Transit platform. We are unique in that we are the only company certified globally by both Land Rover and Ford to convert their vehicles without voiding the warranty. However, modification is just one aspect of our business. Recently, we have expanded the company to distribute a variety of heavy equipment, from earth-movers to fire trucks, and we are also one of the largest global distributors for SDMO, a French power generation company. We also add value for our customers by offering additional services, such as leasing and financing.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BULK COMMODITIES</h4><p>In the mineral sector, the main focus is on bulk commodities that are easily marketed to our neighbors, especially China. Therefore, we receive many client enquiries regarding ferrous minerals, such as iron, manganese, vanadium, and titanium.</p><h4>TOUGH COMPETITION</h4><p>One of the concerns that arises when attracting foreign investors to Kazakhstan's mining sector is the very competitive nature of the business. There are many countries that seek foreign investments in mining, and currently sub-Saharan Africa is enjoying a surge in investments.</p><h4>MYRIAD OF OPTIONS</h4><p>I believe that Kazakhstan has the mineral potential that offers plenty of options to larger operators as they meet thresholds of minimum capital, returns, and timelines. However, there are a myriad of smaller deposits for local exploitation, and these resources are open to all players as long as they have the means to exploit the minerals.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SOONER THE BETTER</h4><p>We have started investing heavily to develop expertise here and to spread knowledge throughout the industry. The sooner we do it, the better. In the future, we want to be able to consult with other companies throughout the world.</p><h4>JUST COPPER</h4><p>We began our company working with gold production. However, we ceased the production of gold and decided to focus on copper. All of our copper deposits are located in Kazakhstan. We are currently capable of producing 7,000 tons of copper per year and we aim to increase our capacity to 20,000 tons in 2012.</p><h4>MORE INDEPENDENTS</h4><p>We need to increase the number of independent small producers because they are driving the industry, researching the technology, and industrializing the country. We help the country by creating jobs and investing in new technologies.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SPECIALIZED TOOLS</h4><p>Sandvik Mining has been in Kazakhstan for 10 years with a fully operational branch. The business in Kazakhstan is quite diverse, and we are involved in the mining and construction sectors, where Sandvik offers specialized tools.</p><h4>BEST BUSINESS</h4><p>The mining industry in Kazakhstan is one of the best businesses. Kazakhstan is growing consistently and regularly, and we are growing with it. Sandvik enjoys a long partnership with the country, and we feel it's an excellent place to work.</p><h4>SEEKING STARTUPS</h4><p>There are new joint ventures about to begin, and many of these are with both Kazakhstani and Western mining companies. There are many companies seeking to start businesses in Kazakhstan, simply because the country is politically stable, resource rich, and a nice place to live.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FRIENDS OF THE SCHOOL</h4><p>Our university is unique in that it did not begin with Bachelor's programs, but with short courses. The university is built upon our business experience—the members of the Board of Trustees are prominent Kazakhstani businessmen and friends of the school.</p><h4>GOT TALENT</h4><p>Many people presumed that we would never acquire the financial resources, educators, management, or government support we have today. However, we have been ranked the number one business school in Kazakhstan for the past three years, and we earned this distinction because we have the talent.</p><h4>ENGLISH ONLY</h4><p>I have always been confident that our school could achieve great success. Our strategy has included a strict focus on English and teacher development, as well as orienting ourselves toward the needs of the government and the local market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FAIR DEMANDS</h4><p>Initially, the medical department had the highest demand. Currently, the most popular faculties at KAU are humanities, international relations, journalism, tourism, and ICT. Other popular majors include management, economy, law, and accounting, which demonstrate fairly static demand.</p><h4>ENSURING SUCCESS</h4><p>English is the language of instruction, and our curriculum adheres to US standards. Additionally, the tuition process, schedule, and degree requirements mimic the US system. To be awarded a credit, students must spend 15 hours in the classroom and 30 hours studying independently.</p><h4>NETWORK IN</h4><p>Every year, we host two job fairs: one in the fall, and one in the spring. We encourage all of our students to attend and begin networking for their future. We have also signed agreements with companies in various sectors, such as finance and international relations.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OUR SCHOOL</h4><p>Our school represents an innovative school model in the Republic of Kazakhstan, implementing new pedagogical technology and teaching methods that integrate the national standards and the philosophy and teaching approaches of the International Baccalaureate (IB).</p><h4>KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER</h4><p>About 30% of our staff are expatriates who have the experience of working somewhere abroad delivering different international programs. Their experience is very appreciated here, and we share our ideas and experience, organizing collaboration between our international and Kazakhstani staff.</p><h4>A NEW KIND</h4><p>Private schools like Miras can offer our educational system a new kind of teacher; a teacher who is open-minded, a lifelong learner, and ready to accept change and implement new ideas in education and communications.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SHARING EXPERIENCES</h4><p>The ABC serves as a direct line to the US political and diplomatic establishment here in the Middle East, and we assist in interacting with the UAE authorities. We also provide the ability to meet with other Americans and share personal and business experiences in Dubai, as well as the broader region.</p><h4>THE LIFESTYLE BRAND</h4><p>I think the UAE has been doing a great job of explaining to US investors the particular economic advantages that the UAE has to offer. Dubai has been very successful at marketing itself effectively as a business and lifestyle brand, and this is slowly eroding the one-sided US stereotype of the Middle East.</p><h4>PARTICULAR INTERESTS</h4><p>Health care and education are sectors that are attracting significant attention of late. For example, Duke University has a presence, and New York University (NYU) has established an amazing program in conjunction with the UAE federal government in Abu Dhabi.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SOFT BUSINESS</h4><p>We needed good mechanisms for interacting socially with UAE nationals, and so we went to the Dubai Chamber of Commerce with the idea of a golf tournament. The executives thought it was fantastic and said that they would sponsor a UAE national team to participate.</p><h4>MAINLAND COMPANIES</h4><p>There is something in the order of more than 300 Australian businesses registered with the Dubai Chamber of Commerce. But those are what you would call “mainland“ companies; businesses that choose to register outside of the free zones with a government entity.</p><h4>TRUE STRENGTHS</h4><p>One of my main focuses is on driving business outward from here into the rest of this region  and trying to find ways for us to act as a conduit for our members to do business regionally, not just in Dubai. That is where Dubai's strengths lie.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>PRIOR TO ARRIVAL</h4><p>Business groups around the world offer companies and individuals a good starting point when entering a new market. British companies often use the BBG to develop relationships and conduct research before they arrive.</p><h4>BASE STATION</h4><p>Dubai has offered relative safety and security for companies wanting to operate within the region. It is great testament to the leadership of the country that so many of the world's leading companies choose the UAE as a base.</p><h4>UNTAPPED POTENTIAL</h4><p>As the region continues to develop, and more companies see the benefit of Dubai as a business center, more opportunities will also arise. One of the best things about operating in Dubai is the untapped potential of the region.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>DEBT MANAGEMENT</h4><p>The main strategy we use for debt management is to understand the reason for default, and then our goal is to come up with a set of practical tailored solutions that suit the debtor and the creditor circumstances. In some cases we find ourselves obliged to do the debt collection through a legal procedure by our law firm.</p><h4>NOTE FOR STARTUPS</h4><p>Start-up companies need to be aware of all the challenges ahead. We at AL WADI benefit from our long experience in debt, legal, and risk management to advise the investors proactively while their businesses  grow and expand.</p><h4>HOW IT'S DONE</h4><p>We run a smart free due diligence to find out if the debt is collectible or not, abroad or domesticly, and collectible over long, medium, or short term. The defaulters can be of two types: some are not capable to pay; others misuse the crisis trying to delay the payments to save their cash.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>HOW TO GET STARTED</h4><p>There are a number of ways for non-UAE nationals to establish a business presence according to UAE law, which include branches and representative offices of foreign commercial companies, limited liability companies, professional firms and sole proprietorship, or complete business start-up through one of the free trade zones.</p><h4>GOOD GUIDE</h4><p>We can guide clients through the entire business start up process including advice on and assistance with the correct commercial structure, type of trade license, sourcing an appropriate local sponsor or service agent, identifying suitable office space, processing residence visa applications, opening bank accounts, and relocation of families.</p><h4>A LOT TO OFFER</h4><p>The UAE has a lot to offer those wishing to start new ventures or established businesses wanting to establish a presence in the Middle East including no corporate, income, capital gains, property, or wealth taxes, and it is easy access to finance.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>LENDERS LOVE SMEs</h4><p>Lenders love to have SME customers, but when it comes down to it, they are not always as keen, and able, to lend them money. My incoming plan was to build a finance company that exclusively focused on lending money to small businesses.</p><h4>OPTIONS</h4><p>If you want to trade within Dubai, you must be a wholly owned company. If you want to use Dubai as a hub from a logistics prospective, or if you want to practice certain activities, such as medicine or professional services, then you can trade within the free zones. If you want to take a product and sell it into Dubai, then you have to be on-shore.</p><h4>CAMPAIGNING FOR CHANGE</h4><p>There needs to be legislation that allows a company to declare bankruptcy without the owner going to prison, so that they can stick around and work towards resolving their problems. We are a big campaigner for that.</p>]]></sections21>

Since January 1, 2010, this union has been changing the rules of the game.</p><h4>FULL OF HOPE</h4><p>The government initiated a new road map for 2020, which aims to diversify the economy and attract new investments to the country. There are also new free economic zone and industrial zone projects. With the high oil and commodity prices, we are full of hope for Kazakhstan's economy and construction sector.</p><h4>OUR BELIEF</h4><p>We believe in this country, we believe in the leadership of this country and we invested in this country. We still continue to invest. We increase our production capacity every year.</p><h4>ANDREW O'BROOKS</h4><h4>PICKING UP SPEED</h4><p>It's always nice to have a big population and a large demand for industrial development. In Kazakhstan, industry is distributed around the country in various pockets, and a lot of cargo is moved by rail. However, the road industry is beginning to increase slowly.</p><h4>THE BASICS</h4><p>Our business comes predominantly from international transport. Many companies are investing in new technology to be able to drive into Europe, and in order to do that they need to meet the Euro 4 emission standard as a minimum.</p><h4>FINDING THE MARKET</h4><p>In the future we'll probably have a presence in the west of the country. We have to look at how to position ourselves strategically and correctly for our partners. This is our fourth year and we're still learning the market—Volvo is still trying to understand where our major customers are.</p><h4>ÖZGÜR GÜNAYDIN</h4><h4>WORK THIS WAY</h4><p>Right now we have almost 150 people working for us. Our approach has increased our mining business four fold in about five years. In numbers, our market share increase from 40% to 50% in terms of product sales, and we also grew our customer support service business considerably.</p><h4>LOYALTY RULES</h4><p>Our loyal customers never think of another option; they think we are the best and will stay with us even if there is another attractive option.</p><h4>AS A TEAM</h4><p>In mining, most of the service companies are serving companies from their branch locations, and mining customers are far away from the cities. What we did was open offices and workshops at their facilities. We allowed our people to work on location, and they ended up working as a team with the customers.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>EXCLUSIVE</h4><p>After 25 years, we are experiencing an annual turnover of more than $130 million. In 2011, we reached $125 million, working in three main areas: audio/video, games, and books. Meloman is the exclusive distributor for all six of the major Hollywood film studios, and we also have the exclusive rights to sell home videos in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan.</p><h4>BIG CONTRACTS</h4><p>Now that we can monitor our sales online, we have a huge advantage. We signed our first contract in 2001 with Sony Columbia, and in 2009 Meloman signed with our latest Hollywood film major, 20th Century Fox.</p><h4>FOREIGN SUPPORT</h4><p>We owe our success to our foreign partners, who supported us in developing a network across the country and giving us the skills to sell products through distribution chains. In terms of country of origin, 15%-20% of our products are produced in Kazakhstan, 14% are Russian, and the remainder comes from Hollywood.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>CONSCIOUS BUSINESS</h4><p>We registered 90% growth in 2011, as a result of our hard work and the projects we have carried out within the company. Most importantly, we are conducting business very consciously, as we designed a budget based on a planned development strategy.</p><h4>DIFFERENT STYLES</h4><p>Kazakhstan is a very large country with a low population density. Consumer behavior changes from region to region. While people in the South like to bargain, Western consumers enter the store and buy goods at their marked price.</p><h4>UNLIMITED RESOURCES</h4><p>There is a large increase in the demand for computer technology and smart phones. Products such as iPads and Samsung Galaxy Tabs are revolutionizing the way people think; users now have an unlimited resource for information.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MADE POSSIBLE</h4><p>The past year has been revealing for us in many respects. We have achieved excellent results, which was made possible by the optimal combination of aggressive marketing strategies and the ongoing monitoring of the quality of our products.</p><h4>PERSONALLY APPROVED</h4><p>Each of our new projects is an event in terms of innovation. Each one of our offerings is the result of the hard work of a team of specialists. That is why we are confident in our business; we personally inspect the quality of our products.</p><h4>3D &amp; SMART</h4><p>Our company is currently focused on the development and implementation of innovative technology. In particular, our goal today is world leadership in 3D and smart technologies. This applies to the company's positioning in the global and local market place.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AWARENESS</h4><p>In terms of inquiries through our switchboard and email server, we have seen the most interest from the retail sector. We know there is a great degree of interest and awareness in that area of the business.</p><h4>MEETING NEEDS</h4><p>In response to public interest we have just commissioned a fairly extensive market research survey to gauge public perceptions and needs. We have also looked at what challenges we could face in terms of legal obstacles.</p><h4>EQUAL CHANCES</h4><p>The economy is growing at a rate of 7% without necessarily stepping on anybody's toes or cannibalizing other businesses. This natural growth will give us the opportunity to meet our objectives.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MORE FOR INVESTMENTS</h4><p>In the past, our customers were very conservative, and preferred to keep their money in the bank. Now we're seeing more people use their funds for investments, albeit in a conservative manner.</p><h4>LARGER COMPANIES</h4><p>We want to focus on larger companies, rather than SMEs. We support large companies as they develop their businesses. Such companies are very dominant in the economy vis-í -vis the SME loan segment.</p><h4>MORE EXCHANGE</h4><p>Asian economies, particularly China, are large investors in Kazakhstan. We can anticipate continued Chinese interest in investing money in Kazakhstan. There are more flights to Asian destinations, especially Hong Kong, and that indicates more exchange and more opening up.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>RIDE THE WAVE</h4><p>Credit demand will come in response to increased investments. There are significant investment requirements in the country in the sectors of energy, power, and mining. If some parts of the local capital markets or the financial industry can supply these funds, the resources will be absorbed and create a new wave of demand.</p><h4>CONFIDENT &amp; HAPPY</h4><p>The year 2011 was very successful for us, and we were very satisfied with our operations throughout the country. We have a great deal of confidence in Kazakhstan's short- and long-term outlook, and this gives us plenty to be happy about.</p><h4>STRONG &amp; STEADY</h4><p>In today's interconnected world, any economic tremor will affect nearly everyone at some level. However, this is not a major cause for concern, and we do not expect a second crisis to destabilize Kazakhstan in any major way.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>PERFECT COMBO</h4><p>We are part of an international banking group and have been active in Kazakhstan for more than 10 years. We aim to combine our international know-how with our experience in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>QUALITY &amp; ADVANTAGES</h4><p>Besides financial strength, we are focused on the products and services that deliver high-quality added value to our clients. The quality of our staff and service, variety of products and services, IT infrastructure, and large distribution channels are some of our competitive advantages.</p><h4>NEW PLANS</h4><p>We will continue to deliver unique services to the market, especially in credit cards and alternative delivery channels. In 2012 we launched the installment feature in credit cards and have plans to introduce several advantages to our credit-card holders.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>ADM is an investment advisor to a fund. We advise the Kazakhstan Capital Recovery Fund (KCRF), which was set up jointly by Kazakhstan Capital Management (KCM). The fund is targeting distressed asset investments, which is definitely the correct field. Due to the consequences of the global financial crisis, the Kazakhstani financial system was damaged. Many borrowers were not in a position to service their debt, and therefore became distressed. There are a number of reasons for this, including the general economic contraction and the under-capitalization of many companies with high levels of debt and inadequate capital. The investors recognized an opportunity to set up this fund. We have identified and executed several transactions. We don't actually look for distressed assets—we seek distressed sellers. The assets we help are similar to a tree or flower that hasn't been tended properly; in order for it to be healthy, it needs to be watered and cared for. If the crop was bad to begin with, it doesn't matter how much you water it. We aren't seeking to help someone whose assets are inherently in bad shape. It's very difficult to turn around a bank in any economy. But in this economy, there is an increasing scarcity of funding for all institutions. Previously, Kazakhstan relied on the large international capital markets, and only recently have we switched to depend more on the domestic market, based on deposits.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>There are still issues in the financial sector that need to be addressed. The regulator has been working hard to resolve some of those issues, and I think a lot of progress has been made. We have seen several initiatives proposed that should help address the backlog of non-performing loans on the banks' balance sheets. Outside the difficulties faced by the financial sector, in our view Kazakhstan deserves a higher country rating, on a peer comparison basis, than the BBB it has right now. Once these issues have been resolved, I'm sure Kazakhstan will be well positioned to see its rating upgraded. One of the key problems is the shortage of investable projects and the shortage of good-quality borrowers. The biggest institutions in the country are reasonably liquid, have funds that they are ready to deploy, and are looking to expand their lending activities. However, due to competition for quality credits, margins in the banking sector have been declining steadily over the past few years, putting pressure on bank equity. Distressed asset funds are an emerging business niche and a business opportunity. Once again there's still a lot of improvement in terms of legislation that can be achieved in this respect. More importantly, there are many toxic assets in the world today. Unfortunately, Kazakhstan is not the only country facing this issue—many markets, both emerging and developed, are embattled with the same challenges.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In the Kazakhstani setting, some commentators criticize pension assets as they accrue interest at a slower rate than inflation. There are government guarantees, and we expect that rates should at least return to the same level as the inflation rate. The short-term effect of inflationary pressure was high. With the high inflation rate, there was no instrument that could handle this return in the short term. From that point of view, the inflation spike was not expected. It was not reflected in prices. Today we have a balance mismatch. It was reflected on the pension funds that were invested in different government instruments and corporate bonds. How do we close this mismatch? It has to be covered and refunded by the government. Certain politicians said that the systemic approach was wrong and it needed to change. The problem is that there is no short-term cure. You cannot create a properly functioning money, bond, or fixed-income market that will revive the performance of pension funds and close this gap. The gap exists and it is certainly a liability of the government. Regulation changes are needed before the fixed-income, stock market, and liquid bond markets begin to function properly. This seems unlikely, as the government will always be looking for lower yields for state debt from different bond agencies and also pension assets funding for their own investment programs. This approach will prevail.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>The situation has significantly changed in comparison to the previous years, and we strongly believe that our new team is capable of making adequate decisions in this new wave of investment banking. Our main goal is to become a retail investment bank. We are the first company to give our clients the opportunity to work through an internet platform. Our clients can access the ASYL platform from any location in Kazakhstan, and it is compatible with Kazakhstan's legal framework. Once the People's IPO enters the market, people across Kazakhstan will begin trading more as attractive companies enter the market. Our model eliminates the problem of distance; our clients do not need to come to an office to do business, and every transaction takes place online. We also decreased the price of our commission rate, and a number of offers are very inexpensive, which is very useful for us and attractive for our clients. There are still many problems, but we can see light at the end of the tunnel. There is a large toxic asset fund that the government can withdraw from the banks to create a new fund. With this fund, all the banks will be able to solve their financial issues and grow freely. The National Bank believes that any bad loans can be withdrawn from the banks or be bought by the government, and that would be very positive for us.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The number one problem the 2008 crisis created was not the dysfunction of the capital markets, but the huge loss of trust in institutions, consultants, experts, and rating agencies. The global economy is still structured around a few places like London and New York, but I believe that we are going through a period when globalization is beginning to reach an apex and is now in decline. In other words, everything will have to go through another painful transformation where stock exchanges shift from seeking to emulate London and look to emerging markets such as Johannesburg. Therefore, Istanbul should be Istanbul, Moscow should be Moscow, and Almaty should be Almaty. These markets don't have to try to copy the experience of London, New York, or Frankfurt. Quality can mean very different things in different countries, and the emerging markets will benefit from an era of individuality. At Troika Dialog, we are doing everything by the book: research, sales, and trading. I believe that our share of activity on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) is already a bit larger than it would be normally, especially given the amount of resources we employ here in Kazakhstan. Since we have ambitious plans and are looking to enlarge our staff, I anticipate that this will translate into a greater share of the local market.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Kazakhstan has a young insurance sector, in which life insurance is even younger. For us, the main thing is the development of pension insurance. The second type of insurance we work on is designed for people injured at work, which is mandatory. Once a year every company insures its employees against accidents. Today, GAK is a brand of reliability and stability in the life insurance market. Being socially responsible and strictly adhering to its mission, GAK is actively involved in implementing the best solutions and standards for life insurance in Kazakhstan. As the only state-owned life insurance company, GAK serves as an analyst and consultant on annuity insurance. GAK insurance was created in order to successfully implement a program for the development of the insurance market in Kazakhstan, as well as a program for social reform in the country. The company was originally designed to solve a number of issues in the social sphere such as realizing a citizen's right to a pension from insurance companies on the basis of retirement life annuity contracts. Until 2009, a little more than 1,700 people had opted for such plans, but by 2010 the number increased almost four fold to 6,308 people. At the same time, one in every four contributors at the age of 55 signed a pension annuity contract with GAK, which shows their confidence in the company.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We don't position ourselves in certain segments. Our target is to provide the best service in the market in terms of issuing policies, identifying claims, and offering a wide range of insurance products. Most of our business is corporate, but we also operate in the retail market. We do not open many offices around the country, nor do we advertise. In nine years, we haven't implemented any advertising campaigns and in 2011 we became the number one in voluntary motor (CASCO) insurance in Kazakhstan. We succeeded to attract the attention of a number of vehicle owners in the country. We continue putting a lot of effort in the development of services for this segment. Our customers see that London-Almaty provides the best quality services and they share this information with their friends and family; that is the reason behind our success. It was a management idea to become a leader in the market not by means of opening dozens of offices or putting money into advertising, but to encourage our happy customers to give London-Almaty publicity by word of mouth. Our main clients are SMEs and retail, but we are not present in every sector due to the local nature of the market. Decisions on insurance in the big companies do not typically depend on the quality of insurance company services; instead clients are told to buy insurance with some particular insurance provider, and very often they do not make their choices voluntarily.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Today, the retail insurance market remains the most stable source of insurance premium inflows. Under present economic conditions, this insurance segment is developing in a quite predictable and natural way. The motor owners' civil liability compulsory insurance (OGPO) is leading as per the volume of insurance premiums. Thus, according to the Committee for the Control and Supervision of the Financial Market and Financial Organizations of the Republic of Kazakhstan, as of April 1, 2012, the insurance premium inflow for the OGPO segment totaled more than KZN5.5 million. The increase in 1Q2012 amounted to only 2% over the same period in the previous year. Therefore, the growth rate is not as high as before. This suggests that this insurance segment has already become stable, with each insurance company taking its position in the market. The success of retail insurance mainly depends on infrastructure, such as an advanced agent network and information facilities. These are all very important components in promoting and serving retail insurance products. The Nomad Insurance agent network is one of the largest. Today, over 2,500 agents are working throughout the country in 17 different cities. When talking about retail insurance, it is worth mentioning voluntary retailing. I would like to point out that people have started showing great interest in voluntary types of insurance.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>There are facts, forecasts, and desires. Today, the fact is that we are working not only with corporate clients, but also with retail customers; people with average incomes who have an inexpensive car that is subject to mandatory insurance. BTA Insurance also has a second type of retail customer, and they tend to have above-average wealth and are looking to insure their property and expensive cars. There are the voluntary types of insurance, and of course we have our corporate clients; legal entities that insure their property on a mandatory and voluntary basis. As per forecasts and desires, an analysis of GDP dynamics including wage increases, inflation, and other macroeconomic indicators suggest an increase in business activity, not only in the corporate field, but also an increase of citizens with incomes above the average. We want to attract these consumers more, because we see that this is where our future is. We are developing our service side and will be introducing advanced technology to enhance the experience of our customers. Currently, our insurance portfolio is quite diversified, and none of our insurance segments take more than a 22% share. Oddly enough, we have very high demand for our voluntary health insurance program, although not from individuals. In fact, it is companies that provide social benefits to their employees that request this program the most.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>The government puts a lot of effort into decreasing taxes for SMEs, while opening up business procedures and decreasing the number of documents needed in order to start doing business. It is also working on not bothering young entrepreneurs with excessive inspections. The authorities are also providing loans and student credit at low interest rates. This will also create streams of development in the SME segment, allowing people to open up their own hairdressing shops, bakeries, kindergartens, and markets. This is where we see a big potential, as young entrepreneurial companies are very vulnerable, with tight margins. I also see high demand for health insurance because the country is not yet a good platform for medical insurance. There are three ways to finance medical insurance: through the state, private companies, or a mix. There is no mixed model here yet, but one day, industry heads will have to get together and come up with a way of bridging the gap between the two sectors. The corporate market is huge, and there is a lot of competition. I'm more interested in profit over market position, which are two aspects that must be balanced properly. This can be achieved by targeting less competitive but segments with more potential. The country will have no other chance but to develop this way. While the oil and gas industry is moving backward due to oil prices, SMEs are growing.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BUILD BACK</h4><p>Logistically, the marine industry in Kazakhstan was never developed by the Soviet Union to a very deep extent, so Kazakhstan had to catch up over the last 20 years. Currently, there are around 300 marine vessels registered in Kazakhstan, which is an impressive number.</p><h4>GOING INTERNATIONAL</h4><p>We are going international; the company has reached a point where we feel we can go beyond Kazakhstan's borders and build on the knowledge we currently have through our personnel and our customers.</p><h4>PHASE II</h4><p>The next phase will be established in targeting new markets, clients, and projects in Caspian area in addition to servicing our core project Kashagan Field. Just like all the other contractors and sub-contractors, we are eager to begin work on phase two of Kashagan.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>WIDE SPECTRUM</h4><p>Currently, we are mainly dealing with material supplies to companies involved in the extractive industries. We supply a wide spectrum of products that mining and oil and gas companies need on a day-to-day basis.</p><h4>VITAL LINK</h4><p>I believe that there will be an increased demand for transportation. China, Russia, and Europe, as well as the domestic market would all benefit from more investment in the upgrading of this vital transport link.</p><h4>WELL REFORMED</h4><p>Kazakhstan is among the most well-reformed countries, with credit ratings also up compared to last year. This is an achievement for the regulators and policy makers. Not many countries in the region have managed to up their ratings.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>MORE CONSCIOUS</h4><p>Since 2010, the Kazakhstani government and oil companies are more conscious in comparison to previous years. It is important to launch a powerful service to tackle oil spills. Before drilling and exploration projects start, oil spill response precautions have to be taken.</p><h4>SHARE KNOWLEDGE</h4><p>We believe that local knowledge is the most important thing to be successful in Kazakhstan to further develop and improve preparedness. On the other hand, as a Kazakhstani company, MEKE Kazakhstan would like to share its global expertise with local staff, suppliers, and sub-contractors.</p><h4>CLEAN SEAS</h4><p>MEKE is continuing its activities as the leader in marine environment protection and cleaning sector with the motto “Let's leave clean seas to our children.“ We also pass on the knowledge and skills we have learned in real emergency situations to our customers.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MORE THAN BASIC</h4><p>In the power segment we offer systems that do more than just control the process. We provide systems that help companies become more environmentally friendly and optimize the production process.</p><h4>MEASURING PROGRESS</h4><p>We supply metering stations for oil companies that allow them to determine how much oil is being piped through. The same goes for gas; we launched a gas-metering project for the Asian Gas Pipeline.</p><h4>NEW PRODUCTS</h4><p>The introduction of new products is very important to us, as it allows local customers to carry out projects that were previously deemed technically impossible. One example is wireless technology that facilitates communications by using antennas, and operates from a control center utilizing radio waves.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>ENDLESS SOLUTIONS</h4><p>Honeywell is quite a diversified company. We have thousands of industry solutions, from thermostats to aviation and avionics, and much more.</p><h4>ALTERNATIVES</h4><p>We are working with alternative energy sources, such as green energy. I am particularly trying to push a new product, a home wind generator. It is a unique product with about 52 worldwide patents. It has no gearbox, and it is very cheap and easy to maintain.</p><h4>PERFORMANCE CONTRACTS</h4><p>We can easily save 20%-30% on energy consumption if we apply modern technology to optimize and control consumption and distribution. We are starting to propose performance contracts to customers, so that instead of paying for the solution, they just pay us a percentage of the amount they save.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>PRIOR TO ARRIVAL</h4><p>International leaders operating in Kazakhstan have many factories in China, which were established using European technology. Production from these facilities is shipped to Europe for branding prior to coming to Kazakhstan.</p><h4>AHEAD OF THE REST</h4><p>Clients demand quality and the availability of equipment at the same time, which our company presents. Chinese products may be more affordable, but the quality of their goods lags behind.</p><h4>COMPETITIVE EDGE</h4><p>We purchased equipment from European countries such as Italy, Germany, and Belgium. With this high-tech equipment, we are able to automate our production and reduce the cost of the product, which has given us a competitive edge.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>365 DAYS</h4><p>Turkey has the biggest potential for geothermal in Europe after Iceland. Out of all other renewables, geothermal production is the most efficient. Once you have the source reservoir and the power plant, it works for 365 days of the year.</p><h4>ONLY RENEWABLE</h4><p>In the energy sector we are only interested in renewables because gas is expensive, even though it is an easy investment. More than 50% of production is from gas, but the margins are small. Although not the easiest investment, we invest in renewables because they are much more important and will benefit the whole country in the long term.</p><h4>KNOW-HOW PARTNERS</h4><p>In Turkey we need partners who can help us with know-how and favorable financing terms. As a group we are financially strong and we don't have a problem with financing in our projects.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AT THE FOREFRONT</h4><p>The energy sector has been at the forefront in Turkey over the last couple of decades. The traditional business segments of Borusan Holding have been mainly steel, distributorship and logistics. Thus, it was the strategic decision of Borusan Holding to venture into the energy business.</p><h4>THE MIX</h4><p>We plan to have a portfolio mix of wind, hydro, solar, and gas energy with a focus on renewable resources. Wind energy will remain the major portion of our portfolio.</p><h4>THE FLAGSHIP</h4><p>As our first operational power plant, Bandırma wind farm, with an installed capacity of 60 MW, is our flagship project at the moment. We put the project in operation in 2009 and made subsequent capacity increases in 2010 and 2011.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>AIR CON ONE</h4><p>Our main activity is commercial and industrial air conditioning, which we have been doing for about 47 years. We have started seeing a lot of market interest in installing more energy efficient systems.</p><h4>SOLAR FLARE</h4><p>In terms of solar conditions, Turkey is one of the world's most suitable countries. As for the technology, the sector has developed rapidly in recent years in terms of efficiency. There is an abundance of manufacturers, and as a result there is a very positive pricing strategy.</p><h4>IN THE FUTURE</h4><p>The solar energy segment is definitely something that will grow in the long term. The world's total solar energy installation is around 500 GW. In the last 20 years, Turkey has installed about 4 MW.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>HIGHER PLACES</h4><p>Solimpeks' roots date back to the 1970s. We are third generation and it's not an exaggeration to say that we were born into the solar energy business. We have a strong, well-educated, and experienced team to drive the company to higher places.</p><h4>GOING NUCLEAR?</h4><p>In the short term, Turkey is going to invest in nuclear energy. Right now there are two ongoing nuclear projects. One is a done deal, and the negotiations for the other are continuing. Meanwhile, there is increasing public attention on green energy.</p><h4>INDICATORS</h4><p>According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the ratio of global renewable energy to total energy consumption is expected to increase by 53% by 2020. This indicates massive potential in the hydroelectric and other renewable energy markets.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Battery-powered cars are three to four times more efficient than regular cars. The sector hasn't taken off properly yet because we don't know how to store electricity efficiently, and that creates a range of problems. Much has changed over the last five years, with advanced battery technology and a lowering price. Thanks to gadgets such as the iPad, the price of lithium ion batteries has decreased as there is wider production and a lot of governments are investing money via subsidies, such as China. The US and Israel are especially looking to invest in alternative energy sources for transportation to move away from a reliance on fossil fuels. An Israeli-American company called Better Place develops battery-swapping technology because batteries have limited lifespans. In 10-20 years, Israel will become a country where you can only use electric vehicles. For our commercial customers, we install the charging infrastructure in their warehouses and put in our own meter. At the end of the month, they just pay us say ‚¬1,000 per car for 3,000 kilometers. We also pay for the electricity. We have a campaign called “everything but the driver.“ We started the campaign with our Danish partner to launch it also in Denmark, because it is a very attractive opportunity. We looked up an old partner in Germany, and we also want to do it the UK if it makes sense. We want to enter the UK directly, as London is an especially large market.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Commercial vehicles make up 30%-35% of total sales. There are two reasons behind that. First of all, there is a tax incentive. In Turkey, there are very high taxes in the car market; not only for imported cars, but domestic cars as well. This is called the Special Consumption Tax, which can be as high as 120%. If you would like to buy a ‚¬200,000 Bentley in Turkey, you can only buy it for ‚¬500,000. Medium- to high-income level individuals are buying family-type passenger cars, such as the Volkswagen Polo or Golf. They also purchase from other competitors, such as Fiat, Ford, and Renault. The luxury segment is relatively small, something like 15% of total sales. In terms of local production, most of it is focused on commercial vehicles for the domestic and export market. All of the main brands, such as Ford, Fiat, and Renault, are being manufactured in Turkey. The reason that they are focused on commercial vehicles is that the Special Consumption Tax on this vehicle type is 15%, which is much less than that of passenger cars. Another reason is that there are a growing number of small entrepreneurs, and they would like to buy a car and use it for their business during the daytime and for their family in the evening. It helps both personal and business needs. We finance most of these cars. Most of the financing demand is for small- to medium-sized vehicles. Most Lamborghini customers, for example, make a purchase simply by using cash.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>The year 2011 has broken records for Ford Otosan with respect to production, exports, and domestic market sales. Becoming the “best-selling brand“ for the 10th consecutive year, which is an outstanding achievement in the automotive industry where up to 60 brands compete, Ford Otosan has broken an impossible record. As Ford Otosan, not only were we the bestselling brand of Turkey in 2011, but we also became a leader among Ford markets by achieving the highest market share in Europe. Overtaking France and Spain in terms of total sales with our retail sales of 141,633 units, we became Ford's fourth greatest market in Europe following the UK, Germany, and Italy. Surpassing the 1.5 million ceiling in exports with our Connect exports to North America that exceeded 90,000 units, our growth strategy in global cargo and the delivery of the 175,000th Cargo formed the milestones of the success we achieved in 2011. In my 25 years of experience in this business, I have learned there is never a single reason for anything. The success of Turkey's economy as a whole was one of the reasons, for sure, but there were others, such as the elections, the weather, and the situations in Syria and Iran not being as serious as they are now. We applied many different contingency plans to keep our company as safe as possible during the recession period after 2008 crisis.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Automotive sales are closely related to GDP per capita growth; economic problems in Europe will have a negative impact on the demand side. However, we see this as an opportunity for Far Eastern manufacturers that have facilities close to Europe. Thanks to the logistics cost advantage of Hyundai Assan, we believe that any drop in export sales to Europe will be limited for us. Furthermore, Turkey's surrounding region still has active demand and this balances demand decreases from the European region. I believe that the tax increase will not have an absolute negative effect on car sales, but the demand for smaller engine cars will increase. It's hard to forecast consumer behavior over the short term, but for the long term, with the anticipated increase in personal income levels overall, car ownership will increase despite high taxes. It's clear that manufacturers and distributors should plan ahead for increased demand for small passenger cars. The Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, Taner Yıldız, thinks that the effect of new tax regulations on automobiles will fade away, and I think he is also forecasting the replacement of larger-engine cars with smaller ones in the car pool. The availability of a qualified labor pool, a strategic location close to Europe, the Middle East, and the CIS, increasing local demand, and strong support from the government are the advantages Turkey has.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>We believe that branding is very important for Turkey, and that the country can create its own automobile brand in various platforms. And now we are very close to our target. We opened the door to a new segment with our Concept V1 vehicles and we are working in this direction. We are carrying out comprehensive research to market Concept V1 in different markets such as handicapped accessibility, comfort, environmental friendliness, iconography, and low-cost features. We want to carry our cars proudly in world metropolises as Turkey's first automobile brand in the taxi segment, and later on in the highly accessible vehicle segment. In order to implement our strategy to target international markets we are in a very intensive working tempo. Within the scope of our “V1 Global Marketing Vision“ working study, we are researching macro indicators, supply, demand, and regulator perspectives. Our goal is to create a highly accessible vehicle platform with the Concept V1, make it a benchmark in the international arena, and create a brand in the Turkish automotive industry. We want to conquer the US and the UK in the international markets and be accepted in the Turkish market, and then we want to reach Asia, South America, and other big markets. Karsan plans to start the mass production of the Concept V1 in the first half of 2014, and targets production of 4,000 to 5,000 units yearly to start.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BALANCED MANNER</h4><p>We grow in a steady and balanced manner as we are open to continuous development. In the Turkish market, which reached TL15.2 billion in size in 2011, we ranked third with a 5.1% market share. An analysis of the market in terms of the number of boxes sold showed that we completed the year in third place, selling a total of 100.4 million boxes.</p><h4>STRONG PLAYER</h4><p>We are determined to be a strong player not only in the domestic market but also in foreign markets. As a reflection of the progress we have achieved in this vein, we currently export to a total of 48 countries. By the end of 2013, we aim to raise our exports to $40 million.</p><h4>MANY OPTIONS</h4><p>The Turkish pharmaceutical market is one of the emerging markets offering high growth potential. One of the most important reasons for foreign companies' interest in Turkey is that the pharmaceutical markets in developed countries have reached their saturation point and are growing slowly.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>VERY DEEP</h4><p>Turkey's pharmaceutical industry has transformed over the past few years from being a relatively high-margin industry sector to a low-margin one. It's becoming more and more like the European market, especially on the generic side. The changes have been very fast and very deep.</p><h4>COMPANY EVOLUTION</h4><p>Biofarma has very recently turned to a new strategy and tried to adapt itself to the changing market conditions. The main features of this shift are a more differentiated product portfolio strategy, separate development and management of branding and commercial activities, and more aggressive R&amp;D work.</p><h4>GROWING THE MARKET</h4><p>Domestic companies possess the capacity to deliver the quantity needed to grow the market. Quantitatively there is not going to be a supply problem for the “conventional“ products. But, domestic companies are not able to deliver high-tech production outputs.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>MAKE IT SUSTAINABLE</h4><p>We want to see a different pharmaceutical industry when we arrive at the year 2023, because if the current unsustainable policies are maintained, we will no longer see a strong and powerful pharmaceutical sector in Turkey.</p><h4>ATTRACTING ATTENTION</h4><p>The new incentive legislation is expected to attract the attention of foreign investors and bring in green-field investments in areas where we lack know-how, such as biotechnology, bio-similars, and oncology. Furthermore, Turkey is an attractive market given its large population.</p><h4>FILLING A ROLE</h4><p>There is a very open niche area in value-added generics that could be exploited through improving existing products rather than spending large amounts of money on innovation and trying to seize a role in the innovative industry. Due to the production culture that we have, Turkey could fill this role.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>DRIVING UP</h4><p>Turkey enjoys a relatively young population. This will automatically create demand for medication in the next couple of decades. The population is growing quickly, and this will also mean the number of elderly citizens will increase, also driving up demand.</p><h4>WORKING TOGETHER</h4><p>The public demands innovation, as do patients, which we have to provide from a moral perspective. This is an opportunity not only for the generics business, but it is also important for innovative products. If generic medication is enjoying good opportunities, this will also provide increased exposure to innovative medications.</p><h4>HIGH RANKINGS</h4><p>Yeni Recordati is in a growing position in this market. Our main target is to grow faster than the Turkish market. Considering the different sources of organic and acquisition-based growth parameters now in Turkey, Yeni Recordati has become one of the top-20 companies in unit production, and is in the top 25 in terms of the value created after these acquisitions.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>THE OTHER SIDE</h4><p>Our brand is the best-known rice brand in Turkey and has been well received for about seven years. Our goal is to introduce something different to the sector. We wish to offer pre-cooked rice blended with vegetables and are planning to move to that side of the retail market.</p><h4>NUMBER TWO</h4><p>In 2011, Turkey's total production was very close to 900,000 tons, which is number two in Europe after Italy, a country that produces around 1.6 million tons. This was one factor that led us to building a factory in the Tekirdağ region.</p><h4>PAY ATTENTION</h4><p>In the near future, Turkey will be one of the largest agricultural producers in the world. If enough attention is given to the sector, then I believe it can develop and grow into a major agricultural center in the region.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>TO THE TOP</h4><p>Per capita income is growing and consumption habits are changing, signifying a big opportunity for organic production. We have the capacity to bring sales from zero all the way to the top.</p><h4>KEEP ON FARMING</h4><p>What we are conveying to the ministry is that it should support the farmers, not the industrial companies. There is a huge emigration out of Anatolian villages at the moment, and one of the best ways to keep people in the villages is to draw them to organic farming.</p><h4>LONG-TERM PLAN</h4><p>Our goal is to raise consciousness in the market so that we can increase demand. This will help the farmers. Approximately 90% of organic milk in Turkey is produced by our farmers and company. If we can assume the same long-term growth rates for Turkey as in the UK, then I foresee us reaching around a 14% market share within 15 years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>CHALLENGES &amp; GOALS</h4><p>During the 2001 economic crisis, we began developing solutions to boost the growth of tomatoes. Our developments helped the crop produce more fruit and nutrients than ever before. Every second there is a challenge and a goal, and we put maximum effort into every step.</p><h4>EXCLUSIVE PRODUCER</h4><p>Since 1987 the country has improved greatly, and we now have huge faith in it. The government helps R&amp;D companies, and we feel honored to receive this support. Our infrastructure is ready for these investments, and we are the exclusive producers of our goods.</p><h4>ONE, TWO, THREE</h4><p>We produce value-added products that are more profitable. Many of the products we produce are innovations. We work first for ourselves, second for the country as a whole, and third for people of every economic and social class.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>SOUGHT AFTER</h4><p>Since white meat is an affordable, healthy, and reliable protein source, it has been sought after very heavily in recent years. Per capita consumption, which was 13.8 kilograms in 2006, increased to 18.8 kilograms in 2011.</p><h4>LIFESTYLE CHANGES</h4><p>We offer 30 types of products to our customers in almost 250 varieties. Thus, we can satisfy the demands of many types of customers. We have become a part of a lifestyle change through the demand for further-processed products as well as chicken meat.</p><h4>NEW EQUIPMENT</h4><p>We continue to expand our current facilities with additional investments. We now have the best and most state-of-the-art facilities in Turkey, including a new cutting department and processing facility.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We believe that it is important to re-establish the Silk Road. In the coming years, we will be flying to mainland China and Hong Kong. In addition, we will focus on traffic from China to Europe and Africa that connects through Turkey. This relationship may be one of the processes that triggers Turkey's position as a logistics hub. Considering the activity over the last five years, the economic relations between Turkey and China have increased tremendously. Five years ago, the total volume of trade was $2 billion, and now it is $20 billion. In the medium term, we expect this figure to increase to $50 billion, and $100 billion by 2022. Nowhere in the world are rates increasing at this speed. Meanwhile, we maintain our traditional foreign trade partners such as Germany, Italy, France, and the UK. These are the countries where exports and imports involve a large amount of high value-added material. For a country to be a logistics hub and center, every mode of transportation should be managed and developed in terms of capacity and infrastructure. In land transportation, Turkey is strong, and on the maritime side it is developing. However, air transport is the fastest growing mode of transportation in cargo. In order to be a serious and substantial hub, we need to offer flexible capacity, as well as services for the surrounding countries in the long term.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Despite the overall slowdown in Europe and Asia, more than 31,000 passengers flew Gulf Air to the Turkish commercial capital, Istanbul, in 2011. Located at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, Istanbul continues to be a popular destination for travelers and their families. During 2011, Gulf Air increased its frequency to Istanbul from five to seven weekly flights, having a split-schedule with morning and evening flights. The convenient schedule allows smooth connections for passengers travelling via the airline's hub in Bahrain to the largest Middle East network and to popular onward destinations, including the Indian subcontinent, the Far East, and the GCC region. Turkey is a strategic destination for Gulf Air, and Istanbul is an especially crucial market for us—both as a tourist destination and as a business hub, with more than 2,600 travelers a month. Passengers have been travelling between Istanbul and Bahrain since 1988, when our first operations started. As a contributor to Gulf Air's network, the Turkish market is strong, with over 60% of sales from Istanbul, some being onward connections to our global network. A restructuring plan has been initiated with the goal of securing Gulf Air's long-term sustainability. Maintaining our role as the region's largest Middle East network is our aim in the current initiatives.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>When we started a joint venture with Turkish Airlines it was very simple; make better food on board Turkish Airlines flights. That was the idea, and everything else fell into place. Our firm accounts for 100,000 meals in three shifts, which is a really large number. We use fresh ingredients and cook by hand, meaning that although we produce en masse, we do not compromise on quality. The mindset is a boutique approach, and Turkish Airlines is our partner in Turkey. We also cater and operate a lounge at the airport; it is an oasis where you can relax. There is a cinema, a café, a library, and you can play pool. There is also a newsroom and an olive garden. This increases brand awareness. We are considered in this country as an airline-catering brand. This is a premium part of our operations, but we are so much more. In Austria and other countries we do far more, and that is why we decided to open a location in Istanbul. I think it is a great opportunity in terms of the business itself, but far more it is an opportunity to develop brand awareness in the country and be ready for the next step of our expansion.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>I started with Emirates in August 1993. I come from an export-import background and worked for British Airways and then Emirates. Dubai was largely unknown, and so I spoke to the Chamber of Commerce, customs, the warehouses, and cargo villages to discover the export-import trends. Then I did the same thing in Turkey. We went to Turkish producers and exporters, and we made a booklet translated into Turkish that showed how to do business with Dubai, how to invest in Dubai in the free zone, how to set up a company in the free zone or outside it, and how to export. They were trying to sell to Germany and the US, but they had quotas. In Dubai, there are no quotas. We gave them contacts. This was all before the internet of course, and this information is easier to access nowadays. For two years, my office was full of exporters looking to get contacts. After we built up the business to a certain extent, we started to promote Dubai as the closest place with the nicest beaches and sea when it is freezing in Turkey. During the cold winter months, the warmest places Turkish people used to go were to Florida and the Caribbean, which are about 16 hours flight time away. Dubai is just four hours away, offering luxury hotels, high-market restaurants, good shopping, very high-quality service, warm weather, and very nice beaches.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>I represent KLM, Air France, and Delta Airlines in Turkey, which is an important country for all three airlines. Turkey is the origin of many of our passengers and also a key destination. Istanbul is especially booming and finds itself on all the top-10 lists for must-see capital cities in Europe. We have observed increased traffic to Turkey, with inbound and outbound industry passenger numbers totaling 13 million. This has made Turkey a market larger than Denmark, Austria, Portugal, and Greece. The market has yet to become as large as Italy, Germany, or Spain, but we expect it to continue expanding in the future. Considering the developments in the country's GDP, the economy grew by 8% in 2011, compared to less than 1% in the eurozone. The Turkish economy is projected to grow by about 4% in 2012, compared to the -0.5% growth projected in Europe. This makes Turkey a key market for us, and we are basing our regional headquarters in Istanbul to underline the importance we attach to this market. We understand that in the coming decades, Turkey will be a crucial market for us. Similar to Germany, Italy, and Spain today, Turkey will be tomorrow. We need to be here, and we aim to create regional synergy and cost efficiency through our work in the country. Without a doubt, this is the perfect location for a regional office.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>We have 10,000 employees, almost 800 network points, and 3,000 vehicles throughout Turkey. Most of our employees are blue-collar, and managing this whole network of people with limited educational know-how is difficult, especially as using technology becomes more cost effective. In 2012, we are investing in both technology and education, and have engaged in programs with universities across the country. Now, for example, our couriers attend classes to become certified. This is very important for Turkey as a whole, not just for our sector. If 10,000 blue-collar workers go to university, this represents a great educational advancement for the country. The logistics sector is growing every day, and international players have become very interested. The sector is now valued at $80 billion, but it has the capacity to grow to $200 billion. There are many logistics companies of different sizes in Turkey, but the average customer does not believe in these companies as much as they do in North American or European. It is our responsibility to educate customers on how to make use of a logistics company. We are investing nearly TL10 million toward new technology this year, including handheld terminals and document sorting machines. Furthermore, we are investing in electric vehicles such as green cars, which are both environmentally friendly and cost effective. In fact, 100% of our transportation activities are carried out by road.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Horoz Lojistik is in the top three or four companies. There are about four other companies of our size, and we are a family-owned business that faced many competitors as it grew. We manage to keep up, and there are some advantages of being local. There are also companies that have middle production facilities or vendors overseas, so when that happens, multinational contracts become very important for them. Both sides of our joint venture are very happy with the situation, and everything has gone well so far. SDV is a large company that belongs to the Bolleré Group, which owns many subsidiaries in addition to its logistics division. This link was very important, especially in terms of trading with Southeast Asia. Because that gap was closed, we developed more warehousing activity and inventory management where we operate distribution centers that allow companies to store their stock and replenish goods for their retail stores easily. To operate our network accordingly is very important. We have to be able to provide solutions for our customers and combine experience to target certain industries. Economies of scale can also come into effect. We have goals to develop in other industries, and it is our game plan. When you plan for the future, you often end up opening an office or developing a company to serve the needs of the market. This is how we will continue over the next five years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>In 1Q2012, we invested in a bonded warehouse project in Bursa. At the beginning of 2013, we will open another logistics center in Istanbul, which will be a closed space of 36,000 sqm. In total, the area of the complex is 70,000 sqm. We will continue operating our two logistics centers in Istanbul and open additional facilities in Bursa and Izmir, as well as branch offices in Adana and Ankara. We also have representative offices in Trieste, Italy and  Shanghai and Guangzhou, China, boosting our extremely powerful air and sea freight capabilities in the Far East. Mars Logistics owns exactly 500 trailers and has an extra 300 trailers through our sub-contractors. In the last four years, our railroad transportation capacity has also been increasing. We are now one of the largest railroad transport companies in the sector, working with more than 7,200 customers per year. Most of our clients are multinationals or are among Turkey's top companies. By the end of 3Q2012 we expect to add 200 trailers, and in 4Q2012 we are aiming to deliver another 300 trailers. We will start 2013 with a fleet of 1,000 self-owned vehicles. In every branch of logistics, there is increased competition between companies. In the last four years, we saw many buyouts from a number of investment companies. It is important that companies do not decrease their prices at the expense of service quality.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>NEW ARTISTS</h4><p>Art is a growing industry in Turkey. Lately, Turkey has been booming, both in its economy and in art. We have a lot of new artists in Turkey. This will be the next big thing in the next five years. Higher profile individuals are exponentially becoming more involved with art every year. The price of Turkish contemporary artwork is rising very quickly.</p><h4>MAYBE DREAMING</h4><p>A lot of people are doing business in Turkey, and many of them require long-term housing. There will be demand, but it will not be as high as some people expect. A lot of people are dreaming, but I think in a few years Turkey will realize even more of its potential.</p><h4>PLAYING THE CARDS</h4><p>Turkey needs so many new housing projects that the demand will go on forever. The more you produce, the more you will sell. I think demand will rise seriously. Of course, the next five to 10 years will be very important for Turkey—this is the period where, if we play our cards right, Turkey will advance to European standards.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>USING OUR EXPERIENCE</h4><p>We founded the group five years ago, although we have 35 years of experience behind us in the real estate and contracting market in Turkey as well as in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>DRIVEN BY CONCERN</h4><p>People are nervous about earthquakes and want to be sure that they are living in solid, safe, and modern homes. Another reason for growth can be attributed to urban renewal in Istanbul. Projects like this are being promoted to alleviate inner city congestion and urban infrastructure.</p><h4>PRESTIGE IS OURS</h4><p>We are a young and dynamic team at Ege Yapı, and we are very fast and efficient; our quality is exceptional. On top of that, we also have worldwide experience. We have a top-notch team of 200 engineers and architects. All of these factors explain how we won the bid for a prestigious project.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>TIGHTLY WOVEN</h4><p>Turkey is changing, and therefore there are new and different demands. It is not the Turkey of 20 years ago, where everything was more rigid. Today we have a more independent-minded population, but we still have strong family values and tight family units that span generations and are interwoven.</p><h4>INCORPORATING UNITS</h4><p>We have three high-rise buildings on the outskirts of our latest project. These are intended for singles. We then have family-oriented apartments in the center of the project, so they are in the same project but they are not living together.</p><h4>IN THE AFTERMATH</h4><p>After the effects of the crisis lose their impact and the market becomes smoother, most of our funding will come from abroad. Turkey is a safe harbor—the money will flow here, costs will go down, and there will be a larger contribution from the international finance markets. This is going to have to start from Turkey.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>SUIT OURSELVES</h4><p>At Esin Yapı, we use all of the newest and latest technology for our projects. We work with an international network of people and firms that develop and offer this technology. We aim to use the innovations that are best suited to Turkey.</p><h4>LOVING GREEN</h4><p>We use many green materials. They are very expensive, but our customers are willing to purchase green technology, recognizing that the use of green materials will lower their utility costs in the long term. This is especially true for residences, as people can live in buildings at a lower cost.</p><h4>RECIPROCITY RULES<br></h4><p>There are 16 million inhabitants and many people from abroad who are interested in purchasing real estate in Istanbul. With the new reciprocity law, everyone wants to own a house in Istanbul. There are many potential investors because Istanbul is an attractive city that boasts central real estate where people can enjoy a high-quality lifestyle at an affordable price.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>A CERTAIN MATURITY</h4><p>Here, in Asia, and in South America we have growing markets that we think will continue growing, whereas in Western and Eastern Europe, as a group, we are stagnating. For some people, Turkey is still an undiscovered place, but for experienced investors, like our group, Turkey has attained a certain maturity that classifies it with European countries.</p><h4>THE CHAIN</h4><p>Our client base is quite varied. We work only with dealers, people with whom we have a contract, and we do not sell to anyone else. We don't sell directly to construction companies, for example. We have regional directors in Izmir, Ankara, Istanbul, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea, who work with around 350 official dealers.</p><h4>THE NEW MODEL</h4><p>Unlike 10 years ago, the competition has improved its quality, and it is very competitive. Fortunately, the market is growing. If you are vigilant and careful enough, we welcome the competition in Turkey. I think that is the new model for investors.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Shell has been a part of Turkey's growth and development since 1923, the year of the establishment of the Turkish Republic. Turkey has a very important place in Shell's history and in its future plans. As we often emphasize, Shell believes in Turkey's socio-economic dynamics, qualified work force, and in its great growth potential. Shell follows Turkey's momentum with pleasure and supports its growth with its investments. Turkey has a very strategic geographic location between oil and gas resources and major markets. We strongly believe that our recent partnerships in oil exploration will only enhance this position. In short, Shell will continue being a long-term, trusted, and strong investor in Turkey. Total automotive fuel consumption in Turkey, including gasoline, diesel, and AutoLPG, increased by 4.4% in 2011 over 2010 and reached 24.8 million cubic meters. It is foreseen that the market will continue to grow parallel to the increasing amount of cars in Turkey and the growth in the economy. Turkey has a very high energy demand growth rate and it is located right between major oil and gas resources and major markets. Turkey's biggest advantage for further investments is its strong and sustained economic growth and stability in the recent years. This drives demand growth for energy and investment potential.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is very important for Lukoil because it is an important link in the chain of the company's global logistics system. The products we produce in Turkey can be easily imported and sold within the country, which is producing at a deficit. We really believe in Turkey and will continue investing and expanding here. Turkey fits our international retail and refining network perfectly, and that's why we're here. Through the purchase of Akpet, Lukoil's position in Turkey has significantly changed. However, changes in legislation have had an impact. Contracts that were signed for 15 years became invalid, and we had to resign them for five-year terms. Not only has this significantly decreased the value of the system, but it has also brought about a number of issues, such as an imbalance between the obligations and rights of key players within the dealership network model. We're still optimistic and trying to do our best to have a profitable business here. In fact, 70% of our business in Turkey is retail. The rest is allocated toward the distribution sales business. Since new legislation was passed in 2010, we have been able to sell directly to distribution companies operating in the wholesale market. Lukoil also sells jet fuel to aviation companies throughout Turkey, especially in Antalya, where we have good infrastructure. Here in Turkey we have a blending plant in Aliağa in Izmir with a capacity of 12,000 tons, and we produce lubricants there.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>OMV aims to be a focused, integrated oil and gas company with improved overall profitability and strong growth. The strengthening of OMV's shareholding in Petrol Ofisi not only demonstrates the importance of Turkey for OMV, but also strengthens OMV Petrol Ofisi's strategic position as a leading brand in Turkey's industry. As a leading fuel company in Turkey, with a long-established standing and reputation, Petrol Ofisi is well known for its commitment to its customers and employees. OMV Petrol Ofisi cares for its customers and provides the best fuel product efficiency that supports Turkey's economic growth and expands the energy market. Customer focus is at the heart of our strategy in 2012. Car penetration in Turkey is expected to increase from 102 per 1,000 people in 2010 to 123 per 1,000 in 2014, and we want to be the standard bearer for the ultimate customer retail experience. We will be raising our customer service standards to be exemplary within the industry, not only encouraging customer loyalty, but also improving the customer's filling station experience with a variety of offers. Similarly, we expect oil product demand in general in Turkey to increase by 27% between 2010 and 2021, and that Turkey will be the fourth largest gas market in Europe by 2020. The integrated solutions of OMV Turkey will be well positioned to capitalize on this market trend.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TOP FIVE</h4><p>Between 1998 and 2001 we reorganized the company to run two brands. In 2001, we recorded $10 million in turnover; in 2004 we reached $50 million. According to the GFK report, we are now ranked in the first three or five positions in different areas, especially food preparation, cooking, and beverage items, such as coffeemakers.</p><h4>LOOK TO OUR NEIGHBORS</h4><p>Over the last two years, we have discussed how we can establish our well-known brand outside of Turkey. We focused on neighboring countries and also Germany, because there are 3 million-4 million Turks drinking tea and coffee in these areas. This phenomenon also affects the other ethnic groups in these countries.</p><h4>CONNECT TO ASIA</h4><p>We would like to connect the know-how from Asia to Turkish lifestyle habits to create new products. This is the way we look at R&amp;D and the future as well.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>ALMOST HALF</h4><p>The business began as a ready-to-wear shop. The furniture part of the business has developed over the past 15 years, beginning with small decorative pieces, which quickly grew into selling all sorts of furniture. Now, 40% of the company is furniture.</p><h4>IMPORTANT INNOVATION</h4><p>The development of middle-class families accounts for the growth of the majority of retail in Turkey. Our population is huge—we will soon have the largest population in Europe and this is a consumer country. It's also important to be innovative.</p><h4>EXPANSION ABROAD</h4><p>We are focusing first on neighboring countries, but we don't want to limit ourselves. We opened a store in Dubai in May 2012, and we will have eight stores in the UAE in the next two to three years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GROWING UP</h4><p>The company has grown strongly through the diversification of its product range, technological advancements, rapid capacity increases, corporate R&amp;D function, and opening up to global markets.</p><h4>HOW WE PARTICIPATE</h4><p>We believe that public-supported R&amp;D spending and incentive policies can create synergy as long as private enterprises have plans to innovate as part of the strategic agenda. In fact, Åžişecam considers its R&amp;D initiatives a significant basis of its claim to global participation.</p><h4>MAJOR PRIORITIES</h4><p>Our major priorities in flat glass are based on energy efficiency with a focus on environmental sustainability. This generates potential in construction glass products. The Turkish glass industry has also developed products for the automotive and electrical house appliance sectors.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>GOOD BASE</h4><p>Good export potential based on technologies that occur in some sub-sectors carry great importance for the evaluation and diversification of the country's exports. Turkey is a good manufacturing base for these kinds of products.</p><h4>ACCELERATED PRODUCTION</h4><p>Due to its geographical location, Turkey can provide an advantage for emerging economies. Moreover, the supply chain is very strong. There are many of small companies producing parts; the base is very strong. As a result, it is an accelerating product area.</p><h4>MAIN MARKETS</h4><p>European countries are our main markets. Nearly 70% of our export sales are carried out in these countries. Nevertheless, everywhere is our target—the Middle East, CIS, Russia, Europe, and North Africa for white goods. As for brown goods, the US will be added to this list.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>TAI is the second largest F-16 manufacturer after Lockheed Martin. It has been, and still is, one of the most experienced F-16 upgrade companies. As of May 2012, in collaboration with Peace Drive II program, TAI is working on new production to modernize the 66 F-16s of the Turkish Air Force. This is a record in the history of TAI and will be done at a pace that will more or less remain the same until 2014. Even though this has created a series of challenges and required considerable investments both staff- and facility-wise, thanks to our F-16 heritage, none of these programs have missed their respective delivery schedules. TAI's diversified products and capability range grant a unique and unmatched position for the company in the international market. Fixed and rotary-wing platforms, as well as unmanned systems and modernization suites, are a challenging field. The ANKA   MALE Class UAV System, T129 Attack/Tactical Reconnaissance Helicopter, and C130 Avionics Modernization Suite are three major products that have technical superiority and a commercial advantage in the international market. Worldwide recognition of and demand for these products is encouraging for TAI's international market and development activities.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Roketsan was founded on June 14, 1988 through a Turkish Defense Industry Executive Committee (SSIK) decision with the intention of meeting the country's rocket and missile needs for domestic resources. The company is composed of leading Turkish government and private shareholders and currently has around 1,500 employees at its modern facilities. Roketsan has been listed among Turkey's top 500 industrial enterprises since 2007 and is one of Turkey's top 1,000 exporters. Its indigenous design and state-of-the-art technology are shaping the sector thanks to its experienced, well-qualified, and dynamic workforce. In addition, Roketsan has been the reliable partner of national and international projects, working intensively with 400 domestic and 200 overseas companies and cooperating with 250 domestic and 50 overseas subcontractors. With its “continuous improvement“ and “do it right the first time“ principles, Roketsan is well on its way to becoming one of the top 50 rocket and missile organizations in the world. During the Stinger European Common Production Program, Roketsan undertook responsibility for the propulsion system. In such a program, engineering development groups are composed, and the technology that will be used is transferred and assimilated.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>After a one-year process, we have successfully established the Turkish Aircraft Company as an A.Åž. with the Turkish Aeronautical Association (TAA), which has a 51% share. By the end of 2012, we hope to launch production. This is the first company of its kind in Turkey. The TAA was originally established by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in 1925 with the aim of building an indigenous aircraft. Today, we own 49% of the company. One of our most well-known partners is from the Dornier family, which founded a German aircraft company of the same name in 1922. Dornier built hundreds of passenger aircraft, as well as produced amphibian aircraft, such as pontoon planes. Claude Dornier was the founder of the company, and he is the grandfather of Irene Dornier, one of our partners. The Turkish Aircraft Company is the combination of both Turkish and German interest and investment. I am very happy to have Irene Dornier as a partner in the company; the name alone means a lot. There are approximately 250 small airplanes operating in Turkey. In contrast, Italy is a paradise for sports planes, with over 4,500 small aircraft registered, and huge potential for more. In the Munich area, there are at least 700 sports aircraft for a population of 2 million people. We see huge potential to train ultra-light pilots and grant private pilot licenses. The domestic market has very good potential in Turkey.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Alp Aviation is Turkey's third largest aerospace exporter, and it has a 20% market share of all Turkish aerospace exports worldwide. We hope to increase these figures in the coming years. We started off as the Alpera Group of companies, established in 1997-1998. We began in a number of industries, but not aerospace. However, the company anticipated that aerospace would be a growing market, and there were no private companies in the sector. We started at the right time and partnered with the right company through a joint venture with Sikorsky. From the start, we formulated a plan to create a world-class company that could enter into niche areas such as flight safety components and engine rotating parts. We did not limit our company to Sikorsky but opened it up to international original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in major civilian and military programs, such as the Black Hawk program for the US government, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, and the F-135 engine program for the F-35, along with a number of commercial programs including the Boeing 787. We invested in the right product groups, the right technology, and the right people, which has been very helpful. The company distributed few dividends, and instead reinvested a large part of the profits generated.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<p>Infrastructure in the US is far more developed than this region, but that's an opportunity. If we take the mobile phone industry as an example, we didn't have the infrastructure opportunities that the operators needed in the beginning. Nokia and Ericsson were present, but there was no Turkcell or Vodafone. Similarly, in our type of private aviation, for now we don't have the base stations that we need to set that infrastructure up, but if the market is there, and we have a product to support that market, then the infrastructure will follow, just like it did in the mobile phone sector. This is also what happened with the automobile. When Ford first produced the Model T, there were no roads to support it, but the product led to the creation of a road network. If you're the owner of a private jet and say “please build me an airport,“ the authorities will naturally say no. But if you have thousands of people with this request for a new mode of transport, then it becomes a necessity for the government, and it becomes something it would want to do—it would solve a lot of the problems airports have with congestion. We've been growing exponentially. We have around a dozen aircraft in the Turkish region alone. We just sold five aircraft to Dubai. I expect that by the end of 2012, which is when we start delivery of the Eclipse 550s, we should have around 60-70 aircraft in this region.</p>]]></sections41>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>IN ONE YEAR</h4><p>We have almost 700 students, including graduate students, six faculties, 21 departments, almost 140 academic staff, and 70 administrative personnel; so there are almost 1,000 of us. We've achieved a lot in a year.</p><h4>MORE THAN TEACHING</h4><p>We set research goals for staff, and these are an important element of promotion within the university. Research is what distinguishes universities from schools and other educational institutions, so we think it is very important. To be a university professor, you need to do more than just teach.</p><h4>INTERNATIONAL FOCUS</h4><p>We have a few international teachers in our language preparatory school, and we have 15-20 international students from countries such as Pakistan, Turkmenistan, and Somalia. Now, we are receiving applications for the current year, and we are placing an emphasis on internationalization.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>EARLY BEGINNINGS</h4><p>In 1995, I founded a private university with a language school offering Farsi, Arabic, Russian, and Greek language courses, which were not on offer then. The political situation in the country didn't allow these languages. When I founded these schools, I was taking a risk, but I started a successful trend.</p><h4>MATCH MAKING</h4><p>We offer applied education, and no university can emulate what we do. Every student has to work in a company for two days a week. In their first year with a company, students begin to develop business relationships with enterprises, which they often go on to join permanently after graduation.</p><h4>GLOBAL PERSPECTIVES</h4><p>We're trying to prepare our students for life in an international sphere. We also try to send our students abroad on Erasmus and summer programs. We send our students to places like the US, India, and South Africa for six, 12, or even 24 months, to give them a global perspective.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>RESEARCH &amp; FINDINGS</h4><p>We researched education in the UK, the US, Russia, Finland, Denmark, Japan, Germany, and France. We looked at all the private and public schools from high school to university, as well as religious schools, and analyzed our findings.</p><h4>ALL IN ENGLISH</h4><p>In math and science the language of instruction is English and the school is really tough. Students work with their teachers at night, going to laboratories and doing their homework, and we are open on Saturdays and Sundays.</p><h4>AFTER GRADUATION</h4><p>It is not compulsory to take the TOEFL exam when students graduate, but approximately 80% of them do take the exam, and we are the number one school in Turkey in that regard. All of our students go on to university. About 20% go abroad and almost all of them are awarded a scholarship.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>EVERY ANGLE</h4><p>We have several faculties as well as schools of applied sciences that house vocational programs. On the faculty side we have business, engineering, law, arts, and sciences, and we are also setting up schools of architecture and design.</p><h4>TOWARD EMPLOYMENT</h4><p>The entire university is geared toward employability, but in the vocational programs this is even more obvious. Aviation management is one such example. If you look at the growth of the aviation sector across the world, it is growing faster than global GDP.</p><h4>PRIME LOCATION</h4><p>We offer a North American style of education at one-half or one-third of the cost. All of our faculty members were educated in North America. We do all of this in a very interesting city. Istanbul is a city of 14 million and it is an economic and commercial hub for the entire region.</p>]]></sections31>
		<sections41><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>A YOUNG BASE</h4><p>As a young university, we have had a chance to observe the experiences of other new universities, and we have put everything in place. Now we are at the stage of building a strong foundation.</p><h4>MANY FACULTIES</h4><p>The university has 10 faculties, and five of them are health-oriented. There's a medical school, a pharmacy school, a dental school, a four-year healthcare program, and also an occupational school. We also have communications, arts and sciences, law, and social sciences faculties as well.</p><h4>A CHANCE TO COMPETE</h4><p>If we develop the necessary vision from now on, our students and graduates will have the chance to compete with those from other universities, both national and international. We would like our graduates to go and get jobs in Germany, the UK, the US, or anywhere else in the world.</p>]]></sections41>

We established it as a center specifically for Turkey, but its success led it to becoming a regional center that serves the entire world with our products.</p><h4>THE LARGE MAJORITY</h4><p>Turkish universities and local institutes are well positioned for partnerships in the form of joint projects or innovations, as the R&amp;D center in Turkey has 350 Turkish R&amp;D engineers. Currently, Huawei Turkey has 770 employees, the large majority of which are Turkish.</p><h4>PUSH FOR INNOVATION</h4><p>Turkey has the advantage of a large population of qualified young people, and they help drive the push for innovation. In 2011, the number of smartphone users increased dramatically. The shift toward mobile cloud computing is another very important technical direction for Turkey.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>FAST PACE</h4><p>With regard to technology, Turkey is one of our most important countries. This is largely thanks to the country's large, young population, which easily keeps up with the fast pace of development and quickly incorporates state-of-the-art technology.</p><h4>THE FACTS</h4><p>There are 6,750 students in computer engineering departments at 72 universities in Turkey. Together with other engineering departments giving education to students who can work in this field, this figure is 45,000. In 41 techno-parks, there are 14,500 engineers, 1,690 companies, 64 R&amp;D centers, and 20 business incubators.</p><h4>NO MATTER WHAT</h4><p>There were fluctuations in the IT industry in 2011, just like all other industries, due to the elections in our country and economic fluctuations throughout the world. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affected the industry negatively. Despite this, we achieved record double-digit growth.</p>]]></sections11>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Through progress made in recent years, Turkey has taken seventh place among agricultural economies in the world. Accordingly, Turkey is a country that is rapidly expanding the exportation of agricultural and processed food products. This development trend is a beginning for Turkey, and the country has the potential to produce more processed food products and increase its ranking. Turkey has a highly favorable climate and geographic position, hosting approximately 3,900 of the world's 12,000 cultivated species. With respect to its features, Turkey has the potential to contribute significantly to the food security of the world. There have been critical investments in infrastructure aimed at increasing agricultural production. Turkey has focused on completing irrigation projects, designing incentives that encourage planned growth through a basin-based production model, and drafting supportive policies that develop the food industry. We have implemented regulatory infrastructure that includes a product tracking system for agricultural products and ensures that all exports are produced according to EU and worldwide standards. There have also been critical advancements in the farmer registration system, which monitors statutory arrangements in terms of R&amp;D. Turkey aims to produce food brands that are known globally and provide a feeling of trust to consumers worldwide.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In addition to advertising and promotional activities conducted by the Hazelnut Promotion Group, we also place a lot of emphasis on R&amp;D. For the past 10 years, the Hazelnut Promotion Group has carried out many projects such as preventing aflatoxin formation in hazelnuts and determining their shelf life, nutritious value, and benefits for human health. In order to understand at which stage aflatoxin formation occurs, the Hazelnut Promotion Group conducted a project with TÜBİTAK titled “Determination of Factors Affecting Aflatoxin Formation and Preventive Measures in Hazelnuts.“ The three-year study revealed that aflatoxin formation mainly occurred after harvesting, during the drying and warehousing stages. Moreover, we discovered that storing hazelnuts in polyethylene bags under humid conditions also contributed to aflatoxin formation. This study demonstrated the importance of training farmers and traders in order to minimize aflatoxin problems in hazelnut exports. During the project, training programs were organized, and growers, traders, and exporters were educated with the cooperation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. Turkey exports hazelnuts and related products to 103 countries worldwide. Approximately 76% of hazelnut exports are shipped to EU countries; the leading importers are Germany (23%) and Italy (19%).</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>With traditionally high demand for its quality products and also its competitiveness in the international market, our country is one of the leaders in fruit and vegetable production. In recent years, Turkey has made great strides in both its technological infrastructure and also in terms of environmental and safety standards. With the spread of new technologies, production capacity has expanded greatly. This has meant that Turkey has become even more prominent in the international marketplace. Our fruit and vegetable exports grew by 7% in 2011, reaching $2.3 billion, while citrus fruit exports grew 27% to reach $1.1 billion. Turkey achieved record annual exports totaling $134.6 billion in 2011. Our fruit and vegetable exporters and producers have contributed to this growth, mainly by expanding into new markets. Logistics is very important in our sector, as for all sectors. The cold chain is crucial, especially when exporting over long distances. It's also very important to provide rapid delivery to nearby markets so as to maintain our market share. Logistics is key to delivering goods to markets at the optimum level of freshness and quality. At a time when the international markets are more competitive than ever, it's not just important to maintain your share in existing markets, but also to seek alternative markets to expand into. The recent economic crises have highlighted the importance of market diversification, and we too have been following this approach.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BE IN BURSA</h4><p>Bursa is a very important zone, which is growing very rapidly compared to other parts of Turkey. Industry in Bursa is very active, and considering the growth of the country as a whole, it is very attractive for investors.</p><h4>CONTAINERS</h4><p>Container activity brings in the highest revenue. In general, container volumes are double or triple the amount of cars we handle. Container logistics tends to be much more expensive, running at higher rates. As a result, container handling is our primary business.</p><h4>TRAFFIC TERMS</h4><p>Over the last five years, the percentage of the world using containers has grown 2.4 times. However, in Turkey this segment saw almost double that growth, with activity increasing 4.5 fold. This means that Turkey is growing much more rapidly than the world average in container traffic terms.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>BETTER &amp; BRILLIANT</h4><p>TASS won the tender for İDO at a live auction, which was very exciting. The hand-over of the company was completed in June 2011, and since then, we have been working very hard, hoping to make the company a better and more brilliant one.</p><h4>DOUBLE FIGURES</h4><p>We want to be known as an international brand in the near future. This requires some significant figures in turnover, annual growth, and revenues. Hence, we aim to secure a company growth rate that is equal to double the country's general growth annually.</p><h4>TO THE SEA</h4><p>There are many opportunities in every sector in Turkey. The transportation sector, railway projects, and infrastructure work promise a real potential, but we believe that marine transportation is the future. Turkey has invested heavily in air transportation and highways in the last few decades, but now railway and marine transportation projects will take the stage.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>OPTIMIZED</h4><p>We have purchased high-quality Mitsui cranes and support equipment in the terminal and have developed highly trained staff. Yılport has cutting-edge technology for the port business in Turkey, such as optical character recognition (OCR) for containers and advanced systems for managing the business.</p><h4>GATEWAYS</h4><p>The ports in Turkey are very dynamic in the sense that the cargo mix is diverse, and the Marmara region has the advantage of being the gateway to the Black Sea. The large facilities are predominantly gateway terminals that have fairly balanced import-export cargo volumes.</p><h4>ENVIABLE LOCATION</h4><p>For Yılport, we are projecting a 15% increase in container volumes for 2012. The economy may account for approximately 5% to 6% for the region, but we are located in the most industrialized area of Turkey and in close proximity to the largest consumer market.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Turkish businesses entered the Kazakhstani market 20 years ago. Now, Turkey is a completely different and very powerful player in the EMEA region. Turkey's experience will be very useful in the countries of the CIS; Turkey is geographically close to the region and we share a mutual culture and history, which contributes to our cooperation. There is already a trade agreement between our countries, and Turkey is developing new technology and products for new and existing export markets. I firmly believe that the trend of importing technology from Turkey will continue. There is no reason why this cooperation will not come to fruition. Turkey is experienced with and healthily integrated into Europe. Moreover, the country possesses extensive knowledge of the CIS region and the Middle East. Its experience over the past 25 years has made the Turkey a good integrator in the retail and construction sectors. The activity of Turkish construction and engineering companies in Kazakhstan's real estate and construction sector is a good example of blending Western technology with the Turkish mentality.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>To date, there has been approximately $36 billion worth of investment in the shopping center industry. One-third of that was sourced from international investors, while the remaining two-thirds was from domestic investors. That is different from examples you see in Eastern Europe, where the majority of the investments come from international investors. Our circumstances are a result of the significant capital owned by Turkish entrepreneurs. Furthermore, there have been shopping centers built by Turkish entrepreneurs in surrounding countries. Currently, there are over 25 shopping centers owned by Turkish investors abroad. The first one was built in China. This huge wealth balances FDI; however, there is still interest coming from international investors. In the coming year, we will probably see $2 billion or $3 billion in FDI. Every year, I would expect between $1 billion or $2 billion in investment. I believe that we can expect $10 billion worth of investment over the next five years.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Turkey has recorded very serious and significant progress in the construction sector over the last 40 years. With the international expansion policy during the 1980s, Turkish contractors were awarded important, mega-construction projects, many of which were carried out abroad. Considering this process, the strong aspects of the sector could be listed as a world-class equipment pool, experienced technical personnel, technological knowledge, the ability to create alternative projects addressing different income groups, the added value of being domestic, extensive overseas work experience, increased real estate demand in parallel with the growing economy, and intense entrepreneurship. Although Sinpaş GYO was established in 2007, Sinpaş Group is one of the most important real estate companies in Turkey. With its strong corporate structure and economic power, quality of construction and after-sales services, concept projects that facilitate urban life, and the company's public and auditable nature, Sinpaş GYO has become one of the most sought-after real estate companies in Turkey.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>In Turkey, sellers generally assume that by working with more than one agent, they can sell their property more quickly. For high-value properties, we believe that it's much more effective to market and sell the property under a brand like Sotheby's, because we offer security and exclusivity. However, this presents a challenge in terms of marketing because we then sign a special agreement with the client that requires us to withhold their name. There is a large difference between the way realty is carried out in the US and how businesses operate in Turkey, so we had to adapt under the Sotheby's brand and follow a new strategy to conduct our activities in Turkey. In the various US markets, there are set commission rates for real estate. When property owners buy or sell houses, they are required to pay a fixed rate to the agent that represents the seller versus the representative of the buyer, and this rate usually fluctuates between 2.5% and 3%. We work with 3% commission rates. Currently, there is high demand from customers in the Middle East, mainly due to the new reciprocity law being discussed.</p>]]></sections31>

The Iranians have also invited us to build a shopping mall. They want a minimum of three and maximum five malls as big as the Istanbul Cevahir Shopping Center.</p><h4>HAJJ YOUR STAY</h4><p>We also have another investment project in Saudi Arabia. In Mecca and Medina we are building 5,000 studio apartments for Hajj pilgrims. One studio is sold to 36 people who stay there when on the Hajj.</p><h4>ATTRACTED TO YOU</h4><p>There are many great malls in Istanbul. However, any that you go to for over an hour will just bore you. You could spend a whole day in Cevahir, and you wouldn't be bored. In Iran there aren't any proper malls. Therefore, it makes sense that Cevahir would be attractive for them.</p>]]></sections01>

Frankly, we're used to working up north. We're more familiar with the people, the language, the climate, and the bureaucracy in Russia.</p><h4>TOP 100</h4><p>Internationally, we are in the top 100. Currently we have projects in Russia and the Ukraine. We will build some of the highest buildings in Europe, in Moscow with Capital Group, and the project designers are SOMGROUP.</p><h4>DIFFERENT TASTES</h4><p>We've mostly worked with local architects, and projects have mostly been minimalist. However, there are different tastes in different countries. The Russians and Middle Easterners like their architecture a little more opulent and showy.</p>]]></sections11>

Tekfen Construction has undertaken projects for global energy companies such as BP, Eni, and large state-owned companies that require the highest professional standards.</p><h4>SECOND CHANCE</h4><p>The company was very active in Iraq for 25 years before the war, and the country offers significant potential now that some stability has been achieved. Tekfen Construction now has the opportunity to re-open its Baghdad office and renew its registration.</p><h4>WHERE WE LEFT OFF</h4><p>Tekfen Construction will also re-open its branch office in Libya, and is closely following the opportunities and new developments in North Africa.

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>G4S has been in Kazakhstan for the past 15 years, and has a very different approach to providing security. The company had well-established procedures and controls that had never before been in place. Since then, the security business in Kazakhstan has made significant progress. Many people who have previously worked for G4S now work for other security companies or as security managers on the customers' side. As a result, we share our experience—not very openly, but in reality the fact is that many companies use our approach to provide security services. Since the very beginning, G4S was the best in Kazakhstan. Although the market has grown in quality because of knowledge, procedures, and human capital, we still believe we are the leaders. My vision for the future of the security business in Kazakhstan is what we call at G4S “secure solutions." It means we provide everything our customers need. It is our job to advise them. In December 2010, there were new changes to the Guardian Law, which became effective in January 2012. It has changed the face of the sector. Aside from bringing about consolidation, security businesses are now allowed to perform technology protection under their current licenses. Additionally, affiliated security companies within a group of companies are now not allowed to provide security services to that group. These regulations are directed toward ensuring more professional services.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Pedersen and Partners focuses on emerging markets, and we have offices all over the CIS region. Recently, we bought one of the first executive search companies in Russia, and their partners joined our team. In December of 2011, we also bought companies in Spain and Colombia, and now we have offices in Madrid and Bogotá. In Kazakhstan, we started doing business from Moscow, and one of the first executive searches we conducted was for an oil and gas company called KazMunaiGas, before it became nationalized. We helped the company prepare for an IPO and we assisted KazMunaiGas by bringing in a capable executive. We have been operating in Kazakhstan since 2005, and in 2007 we opened an office in the country. Since then, we have been very active in the local market. Expatriates who have never visited Kazakhstan are hesitant about living or working in the country. However, once they arrive, they find that Kazakhstan is truly different from their expectations. Expatriates often want to stay here beyond the terms of their assignment. When we ask why they have chosen to stay, they explain that they are intrigued by the mixture of culture here—it isn't entirely Islamic or Eastern. We can also testify that it is much easier to do business here than in Europe or the US. The tax climate is much more comfortable, and there are many different projects to develop in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our staff is exclusively Kazakhstani, and we have little experience with expatriates. However, the company has no problem working with international companies. Our first big experience of working with a national company was in 2008 when we won a tender from a large local holding. We spent six months negotiating, but the company came to us first. The difficulty was in regards to bureaucracy because we were forced to provide many documents. In terms of working, it takes time to get feedback. Kazakhstani companies have many levels of approval and multiple interview stages; the decision-making process is quite long. For private companies, the process is easier and simpler, as they aim to find the right person in a concrete period of time. They are commercialized and focus on business processes or improvement rather than on other obligations as employers. Other than that, there are no major differences between private and national companies. One of the reasons for our success is that we never compare ourselves to the competition; we believe that we have a personal strategy and our aim is to follow one mission. We are working to be in contact with our customers more and more, analyzing their needs and valuing their feedback. For the first time, we invited an international audit company to check our financial records for 2011, and the company listened to recommendations.</p>]]></sections21>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The reality today is that emerging markets like Turkey will be responsible for the long-term, sustained global growth of many multinationals. The 90 countries managed from here, which include a mix of emerging and developing markets, are critical to the company's future global growth plans. Managing the variety of markets is not as difficult as it might seem. We have six business units based in South Africa, Kenya, Turkey, Russia, India, and Middle East/North Africa. We have functional teams in Istanbul with finance, legal, public affairs and communications, marketing, human resources, and strategy capabilities. The functional team works as part of the global team to come up with strategic plans for each market. We share that with the business units, and we expect them to enrich and add value to them by adapting these plans to their own needs. We operate under a principle of empowered business units, supported by functional teams, striving to work with world-class collaboration, being part of a global team.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>In today's world, whatever we do in any country has global implications. We need to think globally before moving on with new investments in any corner of the globe. I think the most compelling trend is the rise of the emerging markets. It's creating a new consumer group. Business, local governments, and market structures are changing. The developed markets have their own challenges right now in terms of reconstructing and regaining competitiveness. We must be in a place where we can understand both East and West. Besides this, Turkey has its own dynamics. Turkey's location is also significant. There are three economic blocs surrounding the country, each helping the economy and companies to drive growth. The first bloc is Europe, which is still the largest integrated economy. Secondly, there is the region from Russia to the Gulf, which is resource rich and trying to diversify. The third is from Morocco to Pakistan, a region that needs infrastructure and stability.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Philips has a strong bond in Turkey. It has been active in Turkey for over 80 years with brand heritage built on a reputation for quality and innovation. This is an inherently Turkish company, and our customers and staff alike see this as a Turkish company that just happens to be part of a Dutch multinational. A strong multinational, Philips is leveraging global innovation to be locally relevant, building on the long-lasting relationship we have built and are still further expanding. The Turkish market is of great importance to us. The economic conditions here are promising, and the country is trending as one of the world's major growth economies. With this growth, new challenges are emerging. Our strengths in the fields of health care, lighting, and consumer lifestyle innovations enable us to contribute to current challenges like urbanization and the trade deficit in terms of energy efficiency, as well as create an affordable and accessible healthcare system, increasing the well being of the people.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p>Recordati decided to invest in Turkey a few years ago because of the country's growing pharmaceutical market. Over the last few years, prices have fallen slightly, but, in the long term, it is still a very interesting market. The acquisitions of Yeni İlaç in 2008 and Dr. F. Frik İlaç in 2011 firmly fit into our diversification strategy to invest outside the EU. Turkey is now our third largest market—equal to Germany and larger than France or Italy—and we have between 400 and 500 sales representatives in the new Turkish organization. Turkey is a well-developed market, and our employees have a good level of skills and technical knowledge. It is important to have a presence in markets like Turkey and Russia in order to benefit from the higher rate of growth compared to Western European markets. We are increasing our production output in Turkey every year and investing in improving production capacity in our pharmaceutical plant. We believe in our strategy and our business plan commercially, and we expect to grow in the Turkish market.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>The Gaziantep Mosaic Museum is one of the world's most important museums in terms of both the building complex and its collection. The museum contains 2,248 sqm of mosaics, all made by master artists from materials gathered in the region. We learn as much about mythological beliefs as about people's daily lives through these scenes. Gaziantep has hosted many civilizations since ancient times. There are very important archaeological sites with ongoing excavations such as Rumkale, Yesemek, Zeugma, Karkamış, and Dolichia. Yesemek and Zeugma are on UNESCO's Interim World Heritage List. We don't want to separate museum tourism from other types of tourism, because they feed each other. Fairs, festivals, historical places, nature observatories, and cuisine are important parts of Gaziantep's tourism development. We need to make global presentations about Gaziantep and southeastern Anatolia. We don't have beautiful coasts, but these are the lands of Mesopotamia, an area that has witnessed history. Tour companies need to put this region on their lists and give people a chance to see all these beautiful things. Within the next five years, we want to arrange international congresses, conferences, exhibitions, and concerts at our museum complex. We're going to open an institute for mosaics, which will educate people, especially children.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul Modern is Turkey's first museum of modern art to be founded by the private sector and is also the first to establish itself as an influential social platform. We set out to create a genuine museum environment that would provide a multi-faceted platform for communication and culture. We believe we have achieved this and set a precedent for other museums in Turkey seeking to make cultural activities an integral part of our daily lives. Through a wide range of interdisciplinary events, Istanbul Modern has succeeded in creating a new awareness in Turkey of museums as institutions of learning and communication and awakened public interest in visiting them. In this way, we are contributing to the development of a new museum culture in our country. We have also played an important role in promoting the development of powerful sponsorship relationships, modern museum management models, and extra-museum events to enhance the visibility of art. Through national and international exhibitions and retrospectives, Istanbul Modern has provided a space for diverse disciplines and pioneered both contemporary museum practices and interdisciplinary management models in Turkey. Istanbul Modern's establishment represented a significant milestone in the transformation of Turkey's contemporary art environment.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>Our exhibitions have provided Turkish audiences with unique opportunities to experience Western culture and art. Many of the masterpieces in our exhibitions have never before been displayed in Turkey, and the public has shown huge interest in seeing these world-renowned artists for the first time. Our rapidly growing visitor numbers demonstrate the strong interest in art that exists in Istanbul. Alongside our exhibitions, we also organize educational programs to provide our visitors with some background on the works of art in each exhibition. These programs vary from workshops and gallery talks for children and adults to social programs for women and the disabled. Our goal is to reach a variety of target groups from different ages and social backgrounds. Our collaborative work with various museums around the world has helped us to reach art enthusiasts abroad. For example, the current Rembrandt and His Contemporaries exhibition marks the 400th year of diplomatic relations between Turkey and the Netherlands. The exhibition has had a great impact in the Netherlands and beyond. The publicity campaign and media coverage in many countries have helped to capture international attention for the exhibition. The city has a rich history spanning a thousand years, and this history is complemented by the city's culinary wealth, architectural variety, and plethora of opportunities for shopping and sightseeing.</p>]]></sections21>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GÜRMAN TEVFİK</h4><h4>TAX BREAKS</h4><p>If you make an investment of 10% of your wage or a maximum amount limited to the monthly minimum wage, you don't pay any income tax on this amount. Income tax rates range from 15% to 35%. This means that whenever you make an investment, depending on your tax bracket, you can get a tax break.</p><h4>THE NEED TO SAVE</h4><p>The need for private pensions is really emerging, and people will soon learn about their value. Most investors have a mother or father who retired young, but they know they will never get that opportunity, and so they save.</p><h4>NEW ARTICLES</h4><p>I expect that under the new Capital Markets Law there will be a few articles concerning financial investment advice. This is a very important area to address, because otherwise managing people's money is not carried out in the right way.</p><h4>GÖKÇE KABATEPE</h4><h4>TOP THREE</h4><p>Although it has not been easy to continue growing in the other countries of the region because of the global economic crisis, Turkey has been showing some of the strongest growth prospects in the world. Turkey was globally ranked in the top three fastest growing markets in recent years.</p><h4>OPPORTUNITY HERE</h4><p>There is a lot of potential in pharmaceuticals. It is a large, fragmented sector with many local players. The top 10 players in the market make up 50% of the market. About half of those top 10 players are local Turkish companies.</p><h4>FOOTHOLD</h4><p>Companies have grown to a size that is significant enough for foreign investors to tap into. That was not the case in the past, when there were a lot of small companies that the large corporate world outside of Turkey was not interested in. If you want to grow in the region, it's important to have a foothold in Turkey.</p><h4>PAUL DE KROON</h4><h4>HAVE TO BE HERE</h4><p>Turkey is a very important strategic growth market with attractive potential. As a global bank, you simply have to be in Turkey­—given its role as regional base, its favorable demographics, and strong banking sector.</p><h4>PRODUCT LIST</h4><p>Our successful activities have mostly involved large corporate clients—both Turkish and multinational—as well as working with the top domestic banks. As for products, we are focused to meet client needs, combining debt solutions, risk management tools, and transaction services, which include cash and trade as well as supply-chain support.</p><h4>DYNAMISM</h4><p>Many banks have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to obtain a banking license to establish a meaningful presence in Turkey and capture a piece of this impressive growth story. Considering the international banks that have become active in the last 10 years, the dynamism of the market is very clear.</p><h4>MURAT GÜLKAN</h4><h4>BEST IN THE GAME</h4><p>We are the best performing hedge fund in Turkey. We are restricted in our means of advertising that fact. We can't advertise en masse and can't quote any numbers, but we are the best performing fund in Turkey. Our main concern is the restrictions we have in getting our voice heard.</p><h4>INVESTMENT AREAS</h4><p>We concentrate almost exclusively on the public markets. We don't do private equity, for example. We do trade over-the-counter products, typically derivatives that have underlyings in the public market. The Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), depending on how you look at it, is very large and diverse, and yet concentrated at the same time.</p><h4>REGULATIONS</h4><p>The regulations for protecting investors here are very strong and they tend to err on the side of caution, which is a result of the legacy of this country. One of the consequences is that an asset management company is not allowed to set up or establish a fund.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TAX BREAKS</h4><p>If you make an investment of 10% of your wage or a maximum amount limited to the monthly minimum wage, you don't pay any income tax on this amount. Income tax rates range from 15% to 35%. This means that whenever you make an investment, depending on your tax bracket, you can get a tax break.</p><h4>THE NEED TO SAVE</h4><p>The need for private pensions is really emerging, and people will soon learn about their value. Most investors have a mother or father who retired young, but they know they will never get that opportunity, and so they save.</p><h4>NEW ARTICLES</h4><p>I expect that under the new Capital Markets Law there will be a few articles concerning financial investment advice. This is a very important area to address, because otherwise managing people's money is not carried out in the right way.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>TOP THREE</h4><p>Although it has not been easy to continue growing in the other countries of the region because of the global economic crisis, Turkey has been showing some of the strongest growth prospects in the world. Turkey was globally ranked in the top three fastest growing markets in recent years.</p><h4>OPPORTUNITY HERE</h4><p>There is a lot of potential in pharmaceuticals. It is a large, fragmented sector with many local players. The top 10 players in the market make up 50% of the market. About half of those top 10 players are local Turkish companies.</p><h4>FOOTHOLD</h4><p>Companies have grown to a size that is significant enough for foreign investors to tap into. That was not the case in the past, when there were a lot of small companies that the large corporate world outside of Turkey was not interested in. If you want to grow in the region, it's important to have a foothold in Turkey.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<h4><br></h4><h4>HAVE TO BE HERE</h4><p>Turkey is a very important strategic growth market with attractive potential. As a global bank, you simply have to be in Turkey­—given its role as regional base, its favorable demographics, and strong banking sector.</p><h4>PRODUCT LIST</h4><p>Our successful activities have mostly involved large corporate clients—both Turkish and multinational—as well as working with the top domestic banks. As for products, we are focused to meet client needs, combining debt solutions, risk management tools, and transaction services, which include cash and trade as well as supply-chain support.</p><h4>DYNAMISM</h4><p>Many banks have been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to obtain a banking license to establish a meaningful presence in Turkey and capture a piece of this impressive growth story. Considering the international banks that have become active in the last 10 years, the dynamism of the market is very clear.</p>]]></sections21>
		<sections31><![CDATA[<p><br></p><h4>BEST IN THE GAME</h4><p>We are the best performing hedge fund in Turkey. We are restricted in our means of advertising that fact. We can't advertise en masse and can't quote any numbers, but we are the best performing fund in Turkey. Our main concern is the restrictions we have in getting our voice heard.</p><h4>INVESTMENT AREAS</h4><p>We concentrate almost exclusively on the public markets. We don't do private equity, for example. We do trade over-the-counter products, typically derivatives that have underlyings in the public market. The Istanbul Stock Exchange (ISE), depending on how you look at it, is very large and diverse, and yet concentrated at the same time.</p><h4>REGULATIONS</h4><p>The regulations for protecting investors here are very strong and they tend to err on the side of caution, which is a result of the legacy of this country. One of the consequences is that an asset management company is not allowed to set up or establish a fund.</p>]]></sections31>

		<sections01><![CDATA[<p>Truly international, Crowne Plaza offers premium accommodation, designed for the discerning business and leisure traveler who appreciates simplified elegance combined with the practicality of the latest features, as well as value for money. The management of Crowne Plaza Old City Hotel has recently been passed over to Ata Tourism, within the Dorak Holding Group. Many deep-rooted changes have been made during this period with the sole aim of 100% customer contentment. Crowne Plaza wants to be the meetings supplier of choice for corporate customers, adding value to both stakeholders and budgets as a result of our expertise, but in particular because we make Crowne Plaza brands easy to do business with. By understanding this and the local marketplace, we will maximize direct- and third-party relationships and revenue opportunities in order to enable us to deliver our business goals. Crowne Plaza Old City is situated within the historical peninsula of Istanbul, and due to this unique location our hotel earns an important place in corporate, leisure, MICE, and congress tourism. The Old City in Istanbul is usually the first choice of our guests for their group meetings. Crowne Plaza offers high-quality service to its guests with meeting halls fully equipped with the current technology.</p>]]></sections01>
		<sections11><![CDATA[<p>We are geared up toward MICE business. We have close to 4,600 sqm of meeting space in the hotel and a state-of-the-art boardroom that has the latest audio-visual technology. We have been able to attract business that has not come for Ankara, but has come for the JW Marriott brand. We have teamed up with the Congress Center to bring conferences to Ankara. However, we are trying not to be entirely dependent on MICE business. As the Marriott operates more than 3,500 hotels worldwide, we have a very strong customer database and a wide audience that can be reached. We have many clients who book events throughout the year all over the world, and they are always seeking new destinations. These are the people we are trying to reach. We have attracted three large events in this way, mainly from clients who said they would not have considered Ankara before, but were attracted by our luxurious product and the infrastructure of the city. Conference organizers first look at infrastructure and affordability, and Ankara's airport is state of the art. Moreover, the local airport is not operating at full capacity. The city also has a wide variety and availability of rooms and brand hotels. This is where Ankara hoteliers can team up. There are day trips available to the local surroundings, and we firmly believe that Ankara is not getting its fair share of MICE tourism.</p>]]></sections11>
		<sections21><![CDATA[<p>We are primarily a business hotel, and MICE tourism is very important for us. The debt crisis has had a major effect on the MICE tourism industry, but we see this as an opportunity for Istanbul. MICE tourism is the heart of our business. Istanbul is one of the world's largest cities, full of history and culture, and Turkey is increasingly becoming a favorite destination for US, European, and Middle Eastern MICE tourists. We have over 300 rooms with 500 beds, as well as 16 meeting spaces. We are expecting MICE tourism from Europe to pick up again, and the hotel has been working hard to win business back. Istanbul is in the seventh position globally in terms of holding events and conferences, but it is our goal to become number five. We are also expecting an increase in MICE tourism from the Middle East, and in the longer term we are looking to China and the Far East. Technology is also very important. Business travellers and MICE tourists expect the latest technology, so we have renovated all of our meeting rooms, and we are working with a technology company called Abiko to keep our technology up-to-date. The internet is also very important for us. For business travellers and MICE tourists, it is no longer a luxury. They expect the internet to be fast, free, and easy to use.</p>]]></sections21>
