		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you react to the COVID-19 pandemic as an organization, and what impact did it have on your strategy?</h4><p>As an organization, we adopted a swift and proactive COVID-19 response. Intuitively, we prioritized the safety of employees and customers and replaced the bulk of person-to-person interaction with full automation. We also instructed our surveyors to abide by all safety precautions during on-site operations. During the lockdowns we shut down our 40 branches and migrated 95% of our services to our digital platforms, Najm App and Najm Website, which witnessed a total of around 425k downloads between January and September 2020 and processed over 2.2 million transactions during the same period. Additionally, our 24/7 call center receives over 3 million calls a year. Concurrently, our digitalized operations resulted in higher efficiency in service delivery. This was visible through accident reporting which was 25 percent faster through the Najm App than the traditional call center. Najm cooperated with the Saudi Authority for Accredited Valuers (TAQEEM) to activate electronic damage assessment on-site for minor accidents. Najm also supported the government's COVID-19 response, along with 27 other insurance companies, through collectively donating 67.7 million Riyals. The insurance companies also enforced automatic 2-month extensions for 4.8 million policies to support the community as part of an initiative carried out in cooperation with other stakeholders. Besides safety, it was necessary to consider sustainability and quality of operations. Thankfully, we successfully balanced these elements as we pursued our office and field operations along with fulfilling our mission of being the hub of digitalization in the Saudi insurance sector. This has been a breakthrough that endorsed our strategy and helped us assert our position at the core of the Saudi insurance sector.</p><h4>What services has your new data center allowed you to provide?</h4><p>The need for higher digitalization is growing and the forward-looking digitalization initiatives that are being carried out across the Kingdom within Saudi Vision 2030 are being accelerated. In this aspect, Najm has utilized its well-invested digital infrastructure to overhaul motor insurance operations, offering reliable support to individual and corporate users. Today, Najm acts as a repository that stores operations data and makes it available through user-friendly platforms, enabling better communication among all partners to attain common industry goals. Insurance claims, damage claims, and reviewing procedures can all be uploaded via Najm Net. Insurance companies can submit insurance policy data upload requests through the platform. This way Najm contributes to upgrading the digital capabilities of insurance companies by integrating them with its own electronic ecosystem. Najm also carries the Comprehensive Auto Insurance Management Solution (CAMS) through which it collects, records, and exchanges data among insurers. The solution has contributed to developing the capabilities of insurance companies, improving service quality, and detecting fraud.</p><h4>You recently changed your business model and some of the ways that the organization functions. How and why has this happened?</h4><p>Najm's integrated strategy, BASE, focuses on creating a balance between “fixing the basics" and being proactive as we seek to grow our brand through delivering world-class customer-centric operations seeking higher customer satisfaction. Our goal is to support the insurance industry and Saudi Vision 2030, working closely with all stakeholders to optimize the insurance ecosystem and enhance its profitability, and facilitate customers' lives. To do that, we focus on digital innovation as a main enabler of powerful data management through an integrated automation plan featuring Artificial Intelligence technology which we have pursued since the beginning of 2019. Najm invested SAR46 million throughout 2019 and 2020 to prepare its technology infrastructures to support more advanced digital services including utilizing cloud services through the cloud data center, in addition to employing IOT and analytics. This is in addition to the recently certified Tier 3 data center where Najm stores the data of the Saudi motor insurance ecosystem. Concurrently, new highly-digitalized fraud detection systems have been adopted. Seeking an enhanced customer experience, we launched BASE with aims to modernize and improve Najm's business process. This new approach utilizes digital technologies and customer experience metrics to streamline operations and measure their impact in line with best global practices. Currently, we are applying the Net Promoter Score system, one of the most reliable metrics used to understand customer loyalty and satisfaction. In parallel, and since July 2020, Najm has adopted a new business model with a redesigned revenue structure that has aligned its goals with Saudi Vision 2030 to increase the GDP contribution of motor insurance, while increasing the number of insured vehicles. The new pricing structure has shifted the main revenue component, Liability Determination, from a per-accident fee to a per-policy fee. This has led Najm to become more sales driven and customer centric, motivating it to increase operational cost efficiencies while supporting its endeavors to reduce the number of accidents. The amended pricing structure is also intended to provide sufficient revenue for Najm to enable advanced R&amp;D that would benefit insurance awareness and contribute towards safer roads. At the same time, Najm continues to promote traffic safety through Kingdom-wide awareness campaigns, including “Don't Stop Their Life" which won the International Finance Awards and Cosmopolitan the Daily Business Award 'Most Innovative Marketing Campaign in the Insurance Industry'. We also won the 2020 International Business Magazine Awards for Saudi Arabia's Most Innovative Marketing Campaign “Amn Taslam" and for Insurance CEO of the Year, and were honored with the bronze medal at SVUS' 2020 CEO World Awards.</p><h4>What have you seen in terms of growth of the industry during the pandemic?</h4><p>From a global perspective, the insurance sector has been among the few industries that have suffered the least impact of the pandemic and that are expected to make a quick recovery. Global insurance premiums are forecasted to grow anywhere between 3 and 5.6% in 2021, with emerging markets in Asia anticipating a 7% growth in life and non-life premiums. For the Saudi insurance sector, 2020 continued the upward trend of the previous years. General sales between January and September 2020 reached SAR30 billion, with profits of SAR1.3 billion, compared to around SAR 600 million for the same period of 2019. This is mainly owing to improved operational efficiency and sector restructuring and has resulted in raising the sector's contribution to non-oil GDP to 2.18% this year, from 2% in 2019. During the beginning of 2020, the motor insurance income was weighed down by the disruption of field operations; however, as lockdown measures eased down, the sector's indicators soon recuperated beyond pre-COVID levels. Motor insurance premiums grew by 8.7% over the first three quarters of the year. This prompted a growth in the share of motor premiums to 21.8% out of the total premiums. While this growth can be attributed to the strides the motor insurance industry has made in terms of service quality and the new facilities offered through digitalization, it is also part of the anticipated trend driven by a number of factors. One of these factors is the increasing insurance penetration which expanded at an annual rate of 12% between 2014 and 2019. With only 25 motor insurers in the Kingdom, a gradually increasing market penetration and a surge in the number of vehicles due to more females owning cars, we are anticipating higher demand on motor insurance over the coming years. Other factors driving demand include regulatory improvements, such as better enforcement of the compulsory vehicle insurance act, and incentive packages provided by insurers, including a 10% discount on compulsory insurance, and 15% on comprehensive insurance regardless of the policyholder's driving history.</p><h4>What changes in the industry will likely persist beyond the pandemic?</h4><p>While the most obvious post-pandemic transformation is the augmented role of digitalization, there are also other areas of the Saudi insurance industry, with all its segments, that this pandemic has tapped into, like the importance of updating business models and the need to restructure insurance costs. Insurance companies' collective capital currently stands at SAR12.5 billion. The goal is to raise the sector's collective capital in order to mitigate the private sector risk at this critical stage. Achieving this goal may involve strategic insurance company mergers paired with product diversification, especially in the health and motor segments. Thankfully, our motor insurance industry has already begun its recovery journey, progressing towards an innovative operational ecosystem powered by digitalization and AI technologies. With its strong digital capabilities, Najm is leading this recovery through more service automation and by acting as an integrated data hub for the sector. The pandemic ended up advancing our operations, offering us the opportunity to utilize our digital infrastructure and data systems in a way that offers insurance companies and policyholders a wide range of online services while at the same time facilitating field operations. Through this mandate, Najm is also optimizing the insurance sector's contribution to the goals of Saudi Vision 2030 through ushering in a digitalized framework that would enhance profitability, lower risks, enhance the sector's resilience, and support insurers' readiness to accommodate the foreseen growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was your specific mandate upon joining Adaa, and what were your opening priorities?</h4><p>When I joined Adaa, I fully reviewed the center's strategic direction and operations, mainly to determine its successes and what needed to be updated from 2016, when the center was established. Part of my mandate was to connect with Adaa's main stakeholders and identify their needs and challenges. This involved holding interviews with ministers and the heads of government agencies to determine how Adaa can support them in improving their performances. In addition, I reviewed Adaa's product portfolios and performance reports in order to enhance the government's performance-based decision making. I also wanted to learn about the measurement of performance from mature governments that have much experience with the process. In my efforts to shape Adaa's new strategic direction, I greatly benefited from the experiences of the UK, Canada, Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, and the UAE. One of the main performance management takeaways from such benchmarking was that government agencies in mature countries measure their own performances and report them to central government performance agencies. Today, Adaa reports on the performances of government agencies, and we will continue to do so; however, our aim is to enable these agencies to measure their own performances. Adaa found it challenging to assess 582 government agencies; this horizontal spread was causing the analysis in Adaa reports to suffer. Therefore, to ensure the accuracy of Adaa's reports, I agreed with the board of directors that Adaa should focus on measuring national priorities and gradually let go of measuring the performances of agencies. Furthermore, to promote transparency in this process, beginning in 2021, I plan to publish the performance data. One of Adaa's major new measurements is the national satisfaction index of public services, and the baseline value of this index will be generated, also in 2021. This index is the result of evaluations of beneficiaries' satisfaction with several journeys. Finally, I wish to mention one of Adaa products—an app called “Watani." This app allows beneficiaries, including citizens, visitors, and business owners, to evaluate government services. The data collected helps us to evaluate public sector performance from the perspective of beneficiaries. In conclusion, I aim to create a more focused agency, one that helps government agencies to improve their performances and build their internal performance management capabilities.</p><h4>Did you have to change how you measured organizations and the progress on the vision as a result of the pandemic?</h4><p>COVID-19 has had several positive effects. Financially, it made us reprioritize our project initiatives at the governmental and organizational levels. At the governmental level, we looked at the vision's initiatives to reprioritize our work and determine the most important initiatives. As a result of the pandemic, we had to review the government's affected KPIs. Some were positively affected, such as the massive growth in mobile payments, while others were negatively affected, such as international tourism. It should be noted that most KPIs related to digitalization and the IT sector did well.</p><h4>How have digitalization efforts like “Watani" helped you measure the government response to the virus?</h4><p>Watani opened a great gate for us to measure beneficiaries' experiences with public services. As the app's success depends on a large number of beneficiaries participating in the evaluation of a service, we added a push feature to nudge users into giving us their feedback immediately after using a service. For example, if a person obtains a service from the Ministry of Commerce, when they are finished, they receive a message from Watani asking for their feedback. We are also targeting the integration of the Watani app with other successful apps, such as Absher, to obtain more accurate and timely data. Today, we can access many services online; therefore, next year, we plan to give Watani a new dashboard that will integrate with governmental electronic platforms. Last December, we celebrated the integration of the first government agency, the Saudi Red Crescent Authority, with Watani, and we look forward to receiving the feedback. Our strategy is to evolve our mission and approach. We plan to shift every three years, from now until the end of 2022; then every three years from 2022, we will revise our strategic plan. For the first three years, we will focus on measuring the general performance and contributions of a limited number of major government agencies to the national plans and Vision 2030. We chose these agencies carefully by looking at their budgets, beneficiaries, number of services they offer, and whether they are members of CEDA. At the end of the final year, they will graduate as government agencies and can then measure themselves. This is part of our strategy to ensure that we have a mature performance measurement environment.</p><h4>After the pandemic, what will be different this year for your organization?</h4><p>During the pandemic, we learned much that was new, such as an increased reliance on technology, how to save time, and how to think about our current products and initiatives. We looked at how these things contribute to our achieving our strategy, and we revisited and prioritized our strategy so that we learn new things. The pandemic taught us many lessons, the most important of which are the uses of technology. Although we had technology before the pandemic, we did not use it to its full potential. We have used this moment as an opportunity to modernize and reassess our strategy. Despite the challenges, I am confident we will emerge stronger.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2021 will be the 10th anniversary of BYJU'S. What are your proudest achievements thus far for the company at this milestone?</h4><p>BYJU'S has understood the importance of challenging itself, working on continued growth, and never settling for anything less than its biggest aspirations. Knowing that our actions can possibly help change the life of a student, through quality education, has inspired us for the past decade and enabled us to be fiercely passionate about our mission. We have touched the lives of over 80 million students, making us India's largest and most loved school learning app. We were among the top 10 most downloaded education apps in the world during the lockdown. And two years ago, we hit standalone profitability and have been able to grow sustainably ever since. The past year itself has been extremely challenging for everyone, and with the pandemic impacting the learning journeys of over 1 billion students across the globe, the education sector has seen monumental changes in the way it functions. Being a digital-first company, we quickly pivoted our course of action and swiftly enabled our workforce to work remotely.</p><h4>How would you characterize the start-up ecosystem in India, particularly for edtech companies, now versus 10 years ago when BYJU'S was started?</h4><p>The start-up ecosystem in India has seen consistent growth in the past decade. From 29,000 startups in 2014, the numbers have grown exponentially to touch 55,000 in 2020. In fact, India today has the third largest start-up ecosystem in the world and in 2020 alone has added close to 1,600 new companies to just the tech start-up ecosystem. Start-ups do not exist in a vacuum but are a part of a broader business environment or network. In the past decade, factors such as economic reforms, market trends, the impact of technology, and the changing attitudes of the government and society overall have all contributed to the accelerated growth of the start-up ecosystem. 2020 was arguably an unprecedented year for all start-ups. Generally, start-ups launched during a downturn tend to be far more resilient than those started in a better economic state. BYJU'S witnessed over 45 million new students using its learning platforms over the last 10 months. We also witnessed a significant change in the perception of online learning in parents, students, and teachers. With more students exploring online learning for the first time, and teachers becoming digitally empowered, we have seen the scales tip in favor of online learning.</p><h4>As you prepared for further international expansion into markets in the US, UK, and Oceania, what challenges are you finding, if any, in exporting the BYJU'S model? </h4><p>BYJU'S has always centered products around the needs of students and have always paid attention to what works with them. Global expansion is on our cards and is in line with our vision to revolutionize learning. The team at BYJU'S is convinced that once we build the right platform, the aspect of online learning is not limited to a specific geography. The innate nature of learning math and science is universal. Although challenges may arise in terms of cultural sensitivity and culture, we believe we can tackle this issue by adding a few layers to the content and making it more suitable. And while we may need to design the content to accommodate pedagogical constraints, the overall concepts, especially for K12 are universal. We are thus looking at expanding overseas in a phased and sustainable manner. Having said that, India is still our largest market and our biggest focal point. India has the world's largest school-going population and we have only touched the surface of the target market here. Additionally, the focus of all our acquisitions and collaborations have always been to strengthen our offerings and create holistic learning experiences on a single platform. The one question we ask ourselves is if it will be useful to students and if it will be used by students. This is the most fundamental part of our evaluation process. Our core model has continued to grow at 100% year after year. In early 2019, we acquired Osmo, a Palo-Alto based learning games company and last year we acquired India's popular coding platform called WhiteHat Jr. What is so special about white hat Jr, is that it is not just about coding, in a short span of time we have created a community of more than 10,000 high quality teachers on that platform. We are looking to expand this model and tap into the high quality talent pool of teachers in the country. These acquisitions also fit perfectly into our vision of giving students more, and getting them ready for the future. The demand for skills like coding is very liquid all over the world and kids are very willing to learn it. These acquisitions have also given us a headstart when it comes to the U.S. market and have given us a clear opportunity to accelerate our international expansion plans. With regards to other Indian edtech firms, I think they can definitely emerge as global companies. What matters most is the focus on “value creation". Once a company is able to create value in the lives of its end users, it is set for success. Additionally, the fact that Indian ed-tech firms are attracting interest from eminent global investors demonstrates that India is pioneering the digital learning space globally.</p><h4>What must BYJU'S and the edtech sector do to maintain this momentum, even when/if the pandemic is largely over, and lockdowns are no longer in place? </h4><p>Edtech cannot be considered different from education. At the end of the day, it is all about how we can use technology as an enabler and, in some cases, a driver. In terms of technology, and its intervention in education, these are early days. Having said that, the education sector has emerged as a sector of positive relevance owing to the pandemic. With the temporary closure of educational institutions during the lockdown, students became solely dependent on online learning. The education sector is most certainly going through an inflection point. On the other side of the pandemic, we will be able to further capitalize on the current momentum we are witnessing. I am certain we will see the rise of a blended model of education. As a society, we will realize technology and online learning are more allies of offline education than competition. Edtech platforms like BYJU'S will continue to help students learn from the comfort of their homes and experience personalized and contextual learning that would complement their school learning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of ESERP Business School since 2019, and how COVID-19 has affected your operations?</h4><p>ESERP Business &amp; Law School celebrates 30 years of history, with offices in Madrid, Barcelona, and Palma de Mallorca. It teaches official degrees in law, criminology, ADE, international business, advertising, marketing, and public relations. Its contributions to the pedagogical world through the ESERP-ABERTIS Observatory and through the joint book collections with Harvard, McGraw-Hill, Deusto and Planeta stand out. Its honorary titles include six Nobel laureates: Werner Arber (in medicine); Richard Roberts (in medicine); Sheldom L. Glashow (in physics); Finn Erling Kydland (in economics); Eric S. Maskin (in economics); and Camilo José Cela (in literature). The establishment of a school of social and legal sciences that would provide practical and effective teaching prompted the creation of ESERP Business School, supported today by its more than 30-years of history and a network of more than 40,000 former students. Thousands of students have passed through our classrooms, the majority joining the job market in a short space of time and excelling in positions of responsibility. Many of them return to our classrooms to speak and encourage new promotions.</p><h4>Due to the pandemic, distance learning has become more common. How has ESERP adapted to offering its courses online?</h4><p>ESERP had to respond immediately to the automation of processes due to the pandemic. We were prepared; we have been working on this transformation for a long time, which allowed us to use the latest technological tools and offer hybrid training from day one with streaming classes with the same teachers and content. The most notable change has was moving from face-to-face training to hybrid training through streaming. That has meant broadcasting live, applying assistive technologies to serve 1,800 students with their respective teachers, and respecting the same schedules and calendars that they had in person. If we did not have the technology and a qualified professional team, it would not have been possible. The response of our students was extremely positive, with sincere appreciation for their school, and we also learned from them a new training model that we would not have implemented so quickly. There is now a new, powerful model face-to-face training via streaming that is here to stay.</p><h4>Spain is recognized as having a high standard of business schools. What sets ESERP apart from the rest?</h4><p>ESERP Business and Law School has distinguished itself for many years in its personal vocation to accompany each of our students, taking into account their personal circumstances. We have a department exclusively dedicated to accompanying our students through their professional development. We have hundreds of agreements with companies from all business sectors. The union of the university with the company is fundamental. The theoretical and practical training within the different ESERP departments is already integrated into our training system. Our own former students request incorporations with such a specific profile that they know well from their personal experience in our classrooms. We also have one of the best virtual platforms through which our students and former students receive information about national and international job offers that fit their profile. We consider multiculturalism to be a growing value, and the personal and professional relationships between students from different countries create an important network for them. Furthermore, in a situation like the one we are experiencing, ESERP has positioned itself as one of the leading schools when it comes to responding to education in a confinement situation. Currently, we have improved the entire technological infrastructure of the center to be able to give an even better response to our students and face the challenges that arise. We have important expansion projects within online training, new exclusive leadership programs in which business solidarity and the role of women are greatly reinforced. ESERP not only trains students, but is committed to training people with values to become great professionals. We provide them with the best tools to acquire knowledge and skills from an innovative vision.</p><h4>The ESERP Employment Portal was renewed in 2021, with the intention of adapting to new circumstances and the demands of the labor market. What new features does it have, and what benefits does it bring to companies looking for the best talent?</h4><p>ESERP is in permanent contact with prestigious organizations, institutions, and human resources consultants, headhunters, and personnel selection companies, in order to ensure students and alumni have the opportunity to find the professional opportunity that best suits their profile within the sector toward which they are more motivated through individual attention to each student based on their needs, curriculum, and aspirations. ESERP has a specialized platform, through which users access the Job Bank, which has daily offers from national and multinational companies, as well as different resources that seek to enhance the professional profile of our students. In addition, the ESERP website includes services for our alumni, who have at their disposal, events, study plans for continuous training, information on publications, promotions of collaborating companies, and much more.</p><h4>What are ESERP's top priorities for 2021?</h4><p>ESERP Business and Law School is convinced of the importance of new technologies applied to education, which is why we started a technological transformation of our study centers in order to give students the best training and tools for their professional futures. Among the degrees most in demand and with more professional opportunities are the new degrees that we have incorporated into our portfolio of studies, such as the master's degree in law. Our program has received the National Law 2020 award in the training category. We have the collaboration of Wolters Kluwer for the preparation of the best and most up-to-date materials and for the use of the most complete legal basis on the market, as well as Lex How, a leading company in the preparation of the state exam. In addition, all the students in the program carry out guaranteed internships at Andersen, one of the best professional firms in Spain, with the potential to specialize in the firm itself in fields as novel as big data. Andersen is an independent tax and legal firm with a worldwide presence through Andersen Global.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>First known as AveXis, Novartis Gene Therapies leads the development of gene therapies for neurological diseases. Can you give us a brief overview of the history and evolution of the company since its establishment in 2013?</h4><p>Novartis Gene Therapies is a young company that was established in Spain and the rest of Europe about two years ago. The Spanish subsidiary was founded in 2019. We have been operating for a year and a half, and I have been in this position since the beginning. We are part of the Novartis group. As a matter of fact, the change in the company's name is to reflect this change. We are a company of the Novartis group that specializes in gene therapies on the platform AAV9, which is the platform of virus associated to serotype 9. For us, it is extremely important to have the backing of the Novartis group, while we have a light structure that allows us to remain agile in our operations.</p><h4>What main challenges have you faced since you took up the position?</h4><p>The main challenge and opportunity was to build up a company from scratch. We are building a subsidiary of a multinational from the ground up. We are talking about biotech firms that can operate with few workers and attain solid results. That initial part of establishing the company, approving the prices,  and obtaining all the certificates required is a long process. That was the main challenge and opportunity, because it required a great deal of work. We are only seven workers in Spain, and this has been a beautiful story.</p><h4>How has the pandemic impacted Novartis Gene Therapies?</h4><p>From a human point of view, the impact is obvious; it has resulted in working in solitude. My team is in Europe, and my team in Spain is spread across different cities. We had an online working environment established before the pandemic, though this was intensified by 100% when the pandemic occurred. It was challenging, because the expectations of return to normal were not happening, so there was some frustration from a human point of view, and that requires some management work. The probability of delays in all the administrative processes with all the health authorities is high. Right now, their entire focus and resources are on finding a solution to the problem and recovering from the crisis. It is unfair for the patients of these pathologies and for the effort in innovation; however, the circumstances inject a potential delay to bring the medicine Zolgensma to all the patients who need it, which is our absolute priority.</p><h4>Zolgensma is the first gene therapy-based treatment for spinal muscular atrophy and is pending commercialization in Spain. This is actually the treatment that received the award. How is the process of commercialization evolving?</h4><p>The process is ongoing; we have submitted it to the authorities and are waiting on all the approvals. We have a spirit of 100% transparency with the ministry and the autonomous communities to reach an agreement as soon as possible. Zolgensma was approved by the EMA in May 2020 and now all the European countries have their individual approval processes. It was approved in the US one year earlier.</p><h4>The company is developing other innovative therapies for rare neurological diseases such as Rett Syndrome. What treatments are you focusing on?</h4><p>We are focused on AAV9 scientific platform, identifying different target diseases that could potentially be treated with these therapies. We have been speaking about gene therapies for decades; we have talked about them as a future, something that is to come. The challenge of gene duplication was achieved decades ago. The current challenge was how to take the gene to the target organ, make it start “working“, and maintain the effect in the long term. We are proud to have transformed that future into the present. The disease we are treating, spinal muscular atrophy, is a severe and debilitating disease. Children with the most severe type of this disease do not live more than two years if they are no treated without being able to move their heads or their bodies their entire lives. The big challenge for families with children with this disease is to keep them alive. There has been a new treatment recently, but there are still many uncovered medical needs. Then, Zolgensma was developed. It only requires a single dose during the patient's lifetime and takes one hour to administer. In that hour, we introduce millions of capsules of AAV9 with the gene they are missing. With a single dose, the required protein starts to be produce, and in this case it depends on the severity of the disease. If a diagnose is quick, a single dose in a lifetime can help a patient become a healthy person. This is a model of gene therapy and is truly incredible. Based on this same platform of AAV9, we have selected the focus of our investigation area, namely two pathologies: Rett syndrome, which is also a neurodegenerative disease, and Friedreich's ataxia, which is also a neuronal disease that affects children.</p><h4>Novartis Gene Therapies has received three prestigious international awards for its contribution to research and innovation in rare diseases: The Pharma Awards Europe 2020, the Theron Technology-Enabled Award, and the Rare Impact Award. What do they represent to the company?</h4><p>These awards are extremely gratifying to the company. It is a risky situation, compared to working with known platform. It also represents the risk of working with diseases with a low prevalence. Some of these diseases have only 300 patients in Spain, and some of them have a lower prevalence. That recognition of that exercise of courage is extremely rewarding.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected patients suffering from diseases with a low prevalence?</h4><p>On the one hand, for those that have yet to be approved by the public sector, it will take time for patients to access treatments. On the other hand, patients with an approved treatment face the issue of fear factor. These are vulnerable patients who have to go to the hospital regularly for treatment. Now, with the pandemic, there has been a delay in the treatment of patients because there has been a collapse in the public health system.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We have to commercialize the treatment first. Once we launch it, our goal is to treat all patients who could benefit from gene therapy. We will evolve with other products for Rett syndrome and Friedreich's ataxia. The challenge is that there are so few experts in these diseases and only a few in Spain.</p><h4>What are your main goals, and where do you want to see the company in 2021?</h4><p>I would like to see the company launching the product for patients in April; that is the goal. Another important goal is to establish a test for newborns because that helps with the early diagnoses of diseases. There are seven diseases included in tests for newborns, and the list of this changes among autonomous communities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the launch of IPA Qatar and the Invest Qatar brand impacted the investment ecosystem in the country?</h4><p>The Investment Promotion Agency Qatar (IPA Qatar) was established in July 2019, and its mandate is to support high-value inward FDI into the country. This is both to help achieve the 2030 National Vision and to aid in Qatar's economic diversification strategy. The recently launched Invest Qatar brand leverages our integrated ecosystem, including all national licensing platforms such as the Qatar Financial Centre, the Qatar Free Zones Authority, the Qatar Science and Technology Park, as well as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. IPA Qatar works firstly to coordinate the brand as a value proposition directed at investors, highlighting its purpose, direction, and methods. We act as a long-term partner for investors throughout their journey in Qatar, from their discovery of this market up to considering the establishment here and their subsequent growth. IPA Qatar also has a policy advisory function that greatly improves the ease of doing business in the country. We do a continuous review of laws and regulations applicable to FDI. We also regularly advise and publish reports to improve the investment climate and help address any issues that investors might face.</p><h4>Are there any specific geographical locations or sectors IPA Qatar targets for inbound FDI?</h4><p>In terms of geography, the IPA's mandate is generally neutral. We look at the value and economic diversification angle of any FDI project. We also look at talent and high-skilled labor. When it comes to sector preferences, there is a focus on innovative sectors and areas the market dynamics point to, especially in the post-COVID-19 era. One example is fintech and more partnerships between financial and non-financial institutions. Qatar is poised to boost its role as a global fintech hub. Other sectors of interest include advanced manufacturing, where Qatar is actively promoting Industry 4.0, and healthcare, especially due to the spike in demand for medical supplies and health-connected businesses such as tertiary medicine and virtual care. Logistics is another sector of interest. There are massive disruptions in the global supply chain due to COVID-19, and Qatar has a specific logistics play in motion. Virtual education, ICT, and AI in general, are other focuses that are key in terms of Qatar's ongoing economic diversification plan.</p><h4>Would you tell us about IPA Qatar's collaboration with international partner organizations?</h4><p>We understand the importance of multilateral collaboration with our partners to exchange best practices and contribute to a more sustainable global business ecosystem. This integrative approach has become even more important with the recent pandemic. IPA Qatar is an active member of key international organizations, such as the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies and the World Economic Forum's Platform on “Shaping the Future of Investing". We have also signed several agreements with bilateral partner organizations, including Malaysia's Investment Development Agency and the Investment Office under the Presidency of Turkey. Business France is another partner organization we work closely with. Our partnership with our Russian counterparts has advanced to the point that Qatar will participate in the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum in 2021 as a guest country. We have hosted a significant number of events with our partners in 2020 and will continue to leverage these partnerships through a range of continued activities in 2021, whether in terms of events, business coordination and facilitation, or institution-to-institution collaboration.</p><h4>Qatar has been given a stable outlook and continues to enjoy high global rankings despite the recent crisis. How did IPA Qatar complement the country's efforts amid Covid-19?</h4><p>COVID-19 has impacted the global economy, and the IMF has estimated there will be a large impact on FDI. However, Qatar is well-positioned and retained its strong credit rating and stable outlook in 2020, owing to the economy's resilience. Despite the difficulties in the global economy posed by the pandemic, Qatar's economy is projected to grow 2.7% in 2021 in real terms . In terms of IPA's specific role, we adapted our communications strategy and services to a digital environment. We have moved events to an online format, and most of our facilitation services are provided virtually. We are looking to establish an investor connection platform to connect foreign investors and local companies, as well as to present all opportunities, tenders, and key projects. We have published a COVID-19 advisory section on our website and via other communication tools. IPA's investor relations team has been proactive in reaching out to investors. We published a report on the impacts of COVID-19 and where investors, particularly foreign investors, felt an effect on their operations. We helped address these impacts and facilitated a great deal of the feedback in terms of the government's general response. A government stimulus package of around QAR75 billion was disbursed to the local economy. There has been an exchange of ideas and best practices with our international partners and organizations. We understand the importance of having multilateral stakeholder engagement in terms of recovery, and we have been leveraging all these partnerships to achieve that.</p><h4>What role does the local legal system, particularly Qatar's new PPP Law, play in the attractiveness of the country as an FDI destination?</h4><p>The new PPP Law and regulations are a kind of centerpiece in terms of our offering to foreign investors. Enhancing private-sector participation in government projects, like public schools, water treatment plants, and other projects currently in the pipeline is a great added value to the local economy. This creates a more competitive business context and adds a comparative advantage to new projects with a strong private-sector participation. Qatar's PPP Law applies to various types of asset classes, one of which is education. There is a new QAR1-billion project for around 25 schools. Other relevant sectors are transportation, ICT, energy, healthcare, and tourism, and this is only the beginning. We expect to see many more such partnerships in the coming months and hope international investors will take advantage of these opportunities. IPA Qatar looks at these as anchor projects to market and have international companies come and participate here.</p><h4>How will IPA Qatar engage with international investors and partners in 2021 and beyond to attract FDI into these new projects that the government will launch?</h4><p>Looking ahead, IPA Qatar will continue to pursue its mandate by engaging with both investors and partner organizations to bring progress to the FDI arena. Qatar will strengthen its global footprint with new partnerships that help advance the business ecosystem and our improved value proposition due to the new regulatory and legal changes. As IPA Qatar, we look forward to several upcoming international events scheduled for 2021, such as the Qatar-US Roadshow and the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with Qatar as a guest country. We are currently achieving the full agenda of the organization and are committed to achieve Qatar's economic diversification goals together with our national business and licensing platforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The edtech sector has seen record growth during the pandemic and the related lockdowns. What has been the biggest change for Vedantu?</h4><p>2020 was unprecedented, and it has been extremely positive for our sector, specifically in India and for Vedantu. Vedantu was the first company to introduce live tutoring in India; in fact, we were pioneers of this category of service back in 2014. 2020 saw this sector become mainstream, as schools, principals, and teachers were using some form of online teaching aids. One thing that stands out for me is the awareness of the category of online teaching. What would probably have taken four or five years took place in just the last year. No amount of marketing dollars could have created the kind of awareness and growth for the sector that COVID-19 did. The number of students coming onto Vedantu's website to take a free live class grew by almost 25 times in 2020 compared to the previous year. Previously, around 90,000 unique students would come online and attend a live class with Vedantu every month, while in July 2020 we passed 1.5 million unique students. In 2020 6.3 million students took a live class on Vedantu which is a 25X growth on 2019. Student obsession and continuous Innovation towards Impact at Scale has always been the mantra of Vedantu and It was a great year as far as the sector and business is concerned.</p><h4>How might this growth translate into the edtech start-up ecosystem regarding investment and access to capital?</h4><p>This growth will be great for the overall online education ecosystem, not just in India but globally. However, even before the pandemic hit, online education in India was growing rapidly. Vedantu was growing three times YoY even before the pandemic. COVID-19 merely accelerated this growth. Likewise, funding rounds were taking place before the pandemic. In September 2019, we did another round with Tiger Global Management and WestBridge Capital, and in January 2020 we did one with GGV Capital. Legend Capital came in subsequently as part of the same round in February 2020, which was another USD35-plus million. Then, in May 2020, Coatue came in with USD100 million. There were three funding rounds in the space of one year pre-pandemic. Online education, and Vedantu specifically, is growing rapidly because India is a massive country with access to quality teaching at an affordable cost. Southeast Asia is similar from a cultural context—people truly value high-quality teaching and education and are willing to pay a premium for it.</p><h4>To what extent have investments in your in-house platforms helped you develop unique learning tools, and what how important is India's internet infrastructure?</h4><p>The situation today is 10 times better than when we started thanks to 4G and better infrastructure. The bandwidth ability and the total number of people who have access to the internet have grown substantially. Having our own platform also helps, not just with this optimization, but also in terms of data. We can capture some of our data from what is happening during a session and use that to personalize the experience for students after the class. Therefore, we created our own platform called WAVE. Our online live interactive learning platform — WAVE, uses AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) to personalize teaching and to increase engagement. It has been operating for four and a half years, and it is one of the best teaching-learning platforms in India by a wide margin. WAVE is more sophisticated and interactive than anything else out there, we can mathematically measure the effectiveness of each teaching-learning engagement and the level of improvement in learning outcomes. This helps in creating a better student experience and results in higher NTSE and other examination results. Investments in our own platform have definitely given us many benefits. The internet continues to be a challenge here, but it is getting solved exponentially in India over time.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the relationship evolving between edtech companies, the government, and traditional offline educational institutes?</h4><p>Edtech is in very early days in India, so any of these types of relationships with edtech companies are not that big yet. Private offline education coaching institutions have been a mixed bag. There are more solutions being created now for traditional institutions by online companies—that is one market. As for partnerships with private companies, many things have been going on in this space in 2020. For example, Vedantu partnered exclusively with Airtel Digital TV to launch its own dedicated interactive educational channels on Airtel D2H platfrom. We have doing something similar with a few other channels as well. 2020 has seen a good jump in these types of private company partnerships, and such partnerships will help Vedantu. They will improve our reach and distribution.</p><h4>What is next for Vedantu, and are you looking to expand your portfolio internationally, and what is your general outlook for 2021?</h4><p>Vedantu is always focused on providing quality education. For us, it is about the classroom and post-classroom experience. With any child that comes into our system, we are thinking about how we are teaching them, what courses and after-class materials we are giving them, and how we help them solve their Q&amp;A, and then improve from there. It is all of that experience that goes into creating a superior learning experience and hence a positive learning outcome. That is Vedantu's goal and one of our pillars, though that is not the only thing. Vedantu is one of the largest providers in India today in terms of our distribution. We got around 210 million unique traffic on our website and platform in 2020 and around 25 million unique users on our app in 2020. And we do not just wait for children to come to us; we go where they are. One of the largest searches for our platform is via YouTube. Vedantu has the largest YouTube K-12 channel on YouTube, and we get almost 65 million views per month and in 2020 we got over 510 million views across our channels. We have invested heavily in increasing our distribution so that more and more students have access to Vedantu's high-quality teachers and their teaching, whether on our platform or elsewhere, and we continue to invest in that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dräger is a family-owned company, founded in Germany in 1889, and has been present in Spain for 45 years. How would you describe its evolution and what are its local milestones?</h4><p>Dräger is a family business, which is managed by the fifth generation and has always actively developed German equipment related to air. We have more than 14,500 employees, and a revenue of EUR2.5 billion per year. We are present in over 190 countries, with 60 subsidiaries, all of which are owned by our group. In Spain we have been present for more than 45 years, and have nearly of 400 employees today, supplying to the healthcare and hospital sectors. We also have a presence in the industrial sector and provide services for police and law enforcement authorities. We manufacture gas detection systems and protective equipment for firefighters, including face masks and helmets, among others.</p><h4>The company has been a reference during the pandemic. At first, Germany donated equipment to the Spanish government, which you installed in record time. Here you have maintained the operation of over 140,000 assets in hospitals in Spain and Portugal. What has been the impact of the pandemic on Dräger?</h4><p>Our claim is “Technology for life," and indeed our work serves to demonstrate that it does indeed work to saves lives. There has not been a single employee in the company at a global level who has not been focused on ensuring that hospitals receive their ventilators and other required products. Indeed, we have managed to maintain the supply chain of products for health institutions throughout a challenging year. Since the start of the pandemic, we sought to sell more protection equipment and supplied-air respirator machines and face masks. The virus spread rapidly throughout the whole globe, and the company successfully multiplied fourfold its manufacturing capacity to supply the products that each country needed. In this subsidiary, we addressed Spain as a company priority due to the situation. We also helped Germany and Spain to reach a bilateral agreement for the donation of certain of our products.</p><h4>Your revenues rose by 7% in the first quarter of 2020. How did 2020 end in terms of revenues?</h4><p>We still do not have all the 2020 figures. We are preparing the finances of the subsidiary and the group. In Spain we have two separate companies. One is dedicated to industrial protection and law enforcement agencies. Our company has been impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Industrial production has slowed down, so we were somewhat impacted as well.</p><h4>Dräger manufactures ventilators, monitors and respirators, in fact, they invented the first respirator in 1907. How do you break down your products and what are the best-selling items?</h4><p>We have two divisions: one is the medical division, which provides technical solutions in critical areas of hospitals. These are for intensive care units and surgery rooms, for example. In this critical area we have incubators and ventilators, among others. This division represents about 60% of our sales. In addition to that, we have the safety division, which is focused on solutions for law enforcement agencies and industrial sector. This division also helps emergency services and industrial companies. In this division, we offer detectors to measure gas levels to mitigate risks. Gas measurement is one of the main areas in which we provide significant value. We also offer drug detection tests for the traffic authorities. We enjoy solid relations in Spain with the traffic agency, the DGT. We also offer products for ambulances and firefighters. We sell individual protection items traditionally aimed at the industrial sector, but where because of the pandemic we have seen a rise in the demand from hospitals.</p><h4>What is your client portfolio?</h4><p>In Spain, 60% of hospitals are public. In the industrial sector we have city halls, autonomous communities and central government for services including firefighting and the police. We gather these services under the umbrella of law enforcement authorities. Our industrial sales are 40% to public administrations, and 60% to private companies.</p><h4>What's the importance of R&amp;D for the company?</h4><p>It is vital, and our four strategic areas are innovation, quality, clients, and employees. As a result, innovation is among our most important areas. We do not invest in R&amp;D in Spain, because we simply provide products and services.</p><h4>Are you intending to manufacture in Spain?</h4><p>We have increased our face mask production in the US, UK, and France. As a Spaniard, I'd love to be able to bring this production capacity to Spain. This would help the country have a greater response for future emergencies. It would also help the Spanish market and the economy as a whole.</p><h4>Can you explain your social corporate responsibility during the pandemic with IFEMA and the Madrid City Hall?</h4><p>We offered our services to the authority as soon as the pandemic started, ultimately supplying over 100 supplied-air respirator machines, while providing a few solutions that have been a great success. When the pandemic started, society at large was frightened at the prospect. But we continued supplying front-line workers services at hospitals.</p><h4>What's your vision on the health sector and the main challenges it faces?</h4><p>In 2020 the unfortunate flaws of the Spanish health sector became apparent, to include a lack of investment in human and material resources. I think that in 2021 we are at the right moment to re-evaluate the situation and see how EU funds might better be deployed towards an improved service.</p><h4>What's your main priority for 2021?</h4><p>Our main goal has always been to save lives always focused on our technology for live, and we will continue with doing so. Another priority is to keep supporting Spain's health sector, which includes a project to manufacture filtering face masks in our country. I believe that we are an example in our sector in Spain and specially the pandemic has shown that we have the capacity and know-how to respond to such challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main infrastructure projects that the state is currently developing?</h4><p>The most important aspect is infrastructure projects, as today we have more than 100 infrastructure projects in the state for MXN3,500 million and around MXN10,000 million in government infrastructure projects, especially the Inter Oceanic corridor and three highways: one that connects Oaxaca to the coast; one that connects Oaxaca to the East; and one that connects both oceans. Moving forward, the 100 infrastructure projects will strengthen our economy, especially in terms of tourism experiences with a cultural center that will be built by top architects from Mexico who are recognized around the world. We are also building public goods infrastructure like a new transport system for the city of Oaxaca in the metropolitan area. Also, regionally speaking, we are building important regional highways on the coast and renovating markets. We have been able to renovate more than 31 and are moving forward with new markets. Also, we are doing infrastructure in public services like water, sewage, and electricity, which are all extremely important for our state. In 2019, the fundamentals of our economy were not where we would like them to be, and we were seeing some deterioration. In January 2020, I closed a deal with some banks to achieve this financing. We did not know the pandemic would occur, but it was the best countercyclical policy we could implement. This is now the fourth year of growth that we have been able to sustain. This year, it is especially important as the economy is projected to contract by perhaps 10%, so there are only six states growing this year. One of them is Oaxaca because of all this infrastructure we are generating. Now that our policies on the pandemic are more controlled, the second part of the plan is our tourism sector, which is extremely sensitive to changes in the economy. Now that we have a yellow rating for the pandemic, we were able to generate a 60% occupancy rate in our hotels during the last Day of the Dead. We hope to maintain this level of growth. Hopefully, we will have a vaccine soon and, moving forward, Oaxaca will be able to be extremely strong in tourism. Before the pandemic, we had more than 36 flights operating in the state, which was a record, and our airports were growing at a rate of about 60%. This year, two important media operators focused on tourism and recognized Oaxaca as the best place in the world to visit for travel and leisure, which gives us excellent momentum. We have been able to push forward some great media coverage through important brand names like Netflix and others to push the brand of Oaxaca worldwide.</p><h4>What challenges did you face positioning the state of Oaxaca as a magnet for investment?</h4><p>The most important part is generating a competitive atmosphere for business. When I started my government, the plan was to generate an atmosphere that invites private investment for the state and goes beyond our normal fast wins and strengths in tourism, namely our gastronomy and history, our great indigenous people, and our biodiversity. We lacked a platform to maintain a level of growth in the primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors and subsequently established an action plan to strengthen those three areas. For example, in the primary sector, which is agriculture, this year we will complete our first agro park and consolidate two new plants to export different foods like limes, milk, and mangos, where Mexico is the top producer but was not generating added value. We are now generating the added value so that we will be able to export. In the secondary sector, which is the most important for us right now, the Inter Oceanic corridor will clearly be significant. It will not only change Oaxaca and the south of Mexico but will be a world player; it is more than a canal. Many try to compare this project to the Panama Canal, but that is only one line of business. The most important part is that we will have a value-added industrial corridor, which is its most important competitive and comparative advantage compared to other corridors in this hemisphere. Other advantages include connectivity, which is why we are building these two highways, and we also have two airports in the region. Then, there is energy; the most important element here is that natural gas has arrived. We have an important investment there, and if any industry wants to set their plants up there, we will have natural gas and the only refinery on the Pacific coast for the entire hemisphere, which is another competitive advantage. We are the main producer of wind energy on the entire continent, and with these three energies we will have one of the cheapest energy sites in the world, which is clearly an advantage for industry. We also have competitive labor and more than 200 universities around the state. We are also extremely competitive in terms of salary prices. Another big element is the special economic zones, which are areas of around more than 100ha that will have fiscal and regulatory benefits. If we include Mexico's 11 international treaties, then we clearly have the right stuff to have an advantage, commercially speaking, in addition to the fiscal and regulatory advantages. The special economic zones will be private, public and private, or public and will be ready by the end of this year. All these create the right atmosphere to generate investments in the right sectors, including the third, which is the services sector, and we are extremely excited about that. We will have an agro park by year-end 2022, and the first investment announced by then. We will see the execution of the first stage next year as well as the train, which will cover 300km. We should be moving around 1.2 million containers at the first stage, and this should generate more momentum. The next stage will be a new port with the biggest depth around the world and a train with more technology features. It is important to have the first stage ready so that it can become a reality. Oaxaca will have two big global projects starting in 2021 with the right atmosphere, and we will have different beaches with different experiences. When the pandemic is over, we will have a new highway, new airport, and new terminal at Oaxaca costing around MXN1 billion. All these elements will generate a new atmosphere for Oaxaca.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the Colombian insurance sector at the moment?</h4><p>As most would expect, the pandemic has impacted the sector, as it has most other industries. In 1Q2020/2Q2020, we had mild growth, while the rest of the year was fairly consistent. This consistency in our industry is due to clients knowing the importance of having health and life insurance policies in force, as well as their long-term savings and overall financial plans. Therefore, due to the pandemic, we were much more top of mind as an industry, which translates into more visibility to consumers. With regards to continued overall growth in Life and Health, we feel that to successfully achieve it, you must always continue to innovate and constantly look for better ways of ensuring continuity, which directly aids in the future of all of our employees and clients alike.</p><h4>What have been the main lessons from this year?</h4><p>To initiate the conversation, to be ready and able to adapt, to remain resilient, and the value of responsiveness to an organization... all of which will be incorporated into our 2021 leadership and management strategies. We feel these lessons are necessary to ensure the continued growth of our company, along with keeping a consistent dialog with our clients.</p><h4>A lot of companies globally had to reorganize their internal management in order to flexible and operational. How did BMI approach this, in what ways has your internal management been reorganized?</h4><p>We currently still have all our staff working from home, each equipped with their tech needs to assure they can conduct their business as efficiently as always, in order to continue to provide the best service to all of our clients, advisors, and suppliers. Working from home has proved to be a great solution to the problem. It helps assure we maintain our top notch quality service, while still protecting the health and safety of our employees. We have also put a lot of focus on technology in 2020, with virtual communication being our main source of communication; we have had this constant virtual contact with our coworkers, but also with more than 600 advisors to assure proper training and support to their teams. We also installed a “work flow" tool that aids in the efficiency of the company, at an operational level. This helps us review our processes and promote the most efficient solution to a problem in any given process, aiding us to achieve our promise of high quality customer service.</p><h4>In what ways are you now providing your services and access to your resources online?</h4><p>We were able to digitize the care processes for our health and life insurance patients through the implementation of various technologies. We also digitized our communication with our sales force, while still maintaining remote advisory and training processes. We have also been able to move to virtual medical evaluations, which helps eliminate unnecessary outings for our clients. This new service is also available for our health policyholders and their families with access to home or telemedicine services.</p><h4>What are your plans for expanding across Colombia?</h4><p>Currently we have more than 600 external business advisors distributed in 15 cities within the country, our expansion plan focuses on continuing to strengthen our business force through the process of training and linking advisors.</p><h4>What are your strategies for increasing access and penetration to insurance?</h4><p>We want to help protect more individuals and their families in Colombia, by continuing to grow and penetrate the market with our insurance solutions and innovative products. Colombia is a market with robust growth opportunities within the health and life insurance sector, which is why BMI has implemented a communication and brand awareness strategy that allows permanently promoted digital advice through its commercial advisors seeking to continue with the active purchase of insurance.</p><h4>BMI offers all of the classic policies covering health, life and other medical insurance, for example. Having carried out some research there seems to the development of 'insurtech,' in order to provide insurance for a growing digital world. What is your take on these new trends in your sector?</h4><p>We are in a digital boom that implies that insurance companies must be at the forefront of digital, so we have initiated and accelerated digitization processes due to the pandemic, in which all companies and the country in general, have had to adapt to a digital age within the new normal. In the case of insurtech, these can be a technological ally when it comes to taking the business to the next level, as they allow the possibility of using analytical tools that allow customers to better understand and achieve the development of products and marketing strategies adapted to the needs of customers which will allow the application of coverage.</p><h4>Do you expect these new types of insurance to be as strong as the classic products?</h4><p>These types of products are profiled for an 100% digital segment such as millennials, they will be strong products according to the niche to which they are aimed. However, classic products will continue to maintain their stability, but will be immersed and fused with digital improvements that will allow them to continue to exist and improve the efficiency of their processes, guaranteeing access to the service.</p><h4>How important is Colombia to BMI's global portfolio?</h4><p>Colombia's importance within the region's local market is high since the country is the fourth largest economy in the region, its insurance consumption is well below comparable countries such as Chile. It is our conviction that Colombia is a market to be developed in the insurance industry and especially in life insurance market, therefore proving just how important it is to BMI's global portfolio.</p><h4>What message would you like to send the international community about investing in the Colombian Insurance market?</h4><p>Investing in Colombia represents a great business opportunity and international expansion, Colombia is one of the main economies of Latin America, where the insurance industry barely reaches 2.8% of the country's GDP, almost less than half of what other similar countries in the region contribute, which represents an opportunity to be part of the development of the market and make more people have the opportunity to ensure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You co-founded MásMóvil in Spain in 2006 with a Norwegian partner, and it is now the fourth-largest operator in the country. What have been your milestones?</h4><p>We will soon turn 15 years old, and it has been an interesting trip. Two foreigners came to Spain to set up a company, and at the time, we did not have deep knowledge of Spain or contacts. Now, we are a nearly EUR2-billion revenue company close to 12 million customers in Spain which 2 million are fixed broadband lines, and more than 1,000 employees and so many things have happened during this journey. We created MásMóvil because mobile communications in Spain at the time was quite expensive; in fact, Spain was the most expensive country for that service, and Spaniards were the least satisfied by mobile phone services. In other countries, there were virtual mobile operators that rented telecommunications infrastructure from legacy operators, and these virtual operators started to offer communications services with personalized service for their clients. We want our clients to have the best experience and to be the most satisfied ones, which has been our main milestone. MásMóvil is the leader in customer satisfaction rankings in Spain. We will continue to work on the digitalization of processes and launch useful services for our clients. In this regard, we have recently launched Energy Go, which is a company to sell energy. We want to be the best European operator in terms of customer satisfaction and social and environmental impact. That is why we are entering the renewable energy sector now.</p><h4>The group has close to 12 million customers and offers a coverage of 98.5% of the territory for mobile phones. What is the company's growth strategy, and what differentiates MásMóvil from its competition?</h4><p>We are fully focused on customer satisfaction. We do not just talk; we base this satisfaction on facts. Last year we saw a relevant reduction in the number of customer complaints, for example, and we expect another big reduction this year. We were the first to share infrastructure with the main operators in Spain. Traditionally in this sector, every operator wanted their own  infrastructure, which limited coverage because there were no resources to cover the entire territory. We started to co-invest and share infrastructure with other operators. As a result, MásMóvil has the highest coverage for fiber optics in Spain with more than 26 million households available. The same happens for mobile coverage. Meanwhile, the company's culture is to remain as a small business. We are becoming larger, but we want to maintain that start-up mentality of low bureaucracy, agility, and low personal egos. We are heavily focused on sustainability. We are the first company in Europe in our category with an environment, social, and governance (ESG) rating. We are also the first operator in Europe involved in the B-Corp certification process, which certifies companies with a relevant environmental and social commitment. We expect to obtain this certification in 2021 as we are still going through the auditing process.</p><h4>Are you working to consolidate yourself into the Portuguese market?</h4><p>We are very interested in the Portuguese market. There are only a few players in the telecommunications sector in Portugal, and we see great opportunity in this market. We are in Portugal together with the three legacy players and another virtual operator. In Spain, there are 25 different brands competing in fixed and mobile services. We will expand our broadband services in Portugal as well as our fiber optic infrastructure. We are also participating in an auction for mobile phone spectrum because we plan building our own mobile phone network in Portugal.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your Energy Go project?</h4><p>We are the first telecommunications operator in Spain to also offer green energy. This is 100% renewable energy. We expect to offer up to 20% in saving costs. For us, it is also to increase loyalty for our clients, so we do not need to earn significant margins in this product. This also makes the company different from others. The customer experience that we offer is similar to what we do with the telecommunications services. We are more digital, transparent, and user-friendly. It only takes five minutes for a new customer to switch their electricity service from the legacy company to ours. There is great interest in the market for these services. People are interested in companies that are committed to the environment. We do not have objectives or specific goals, though we anticipate that Energy Go will be a success, and we will become the number-one company that is an alternative to traditional utilities.</p><h4>You have closed an agreement with El Corte Ingles to enter into the alarm sector. What is your interest in that area?</h4><p>As an operator, we want to lead the “smart home experience" for our clients. We entered into our clients' homes to install fiber optics, and now we can do it in the alarm sector. We always seek different paths to provide services, and this also translates into the security sector. Our proposal is a light model, which would combine cameras, sensors, and other items with innovative existing technology, such as Amazon Eco. It has to be user-friendly and does not require a telecommunication engineer behind to be installed in the homes. This should be a massive service in Spain, which has about 25 million homes and only 2 million alarms. We want to offer innovative solutions for those who cannot afford the current prices of EUR50 per month, which is what legacy businesses offer. This service is for homes as well as small companies. We will likely not focus on extremely large companies for these services in our initial stages.</p><h4>What is your vision in the telecommunication sector in Spain for the medium term?</h4><p>Telecom operators have demonstrated that they are a fundamental part of the economy. The pandemic has shown that connectivity is essential people´s lives and of course for the productivity of companies and the country . This showed that there is not only a huge opportunity for us, also a huge responsibility as well. In our communications, we have to present ourselves as a fundamental industry for the economy. That means we have to seek and create value, not only for the benefit of our companies, but also to our clients, the market, and society as a whole. That implies areas such as our social responsibility mission to bring connectivity to every town and small village in Spain. We connect 500,000 new homes in small towns every year, and that requires a significant investment. That is extremely important because it means we have positively impacted people's lives.</p><h4>What is the company's main goal for 2021?</h4><p>Our main goal is to improve our customer experience. We want the most satisfied customers in Europe, and we will achieve that. We also want to add other services such as energy, which could improve the customer experience. That service can provide benefits to our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>During the Spain Investors Day, you mentioned expanding the Industrial Policy Strategy 2030 as a roadmap to give industry more weight in our economy. What are the main points of the strategy?</h4><p>For over two years, we have been working to set out an industrial policy that meets the challenges of the 21st century. The pandemic has demonstrated the importance of a strong industry, especially due to the development of industrial capacities and the industrial sovereignty that we now see as vital. What is more, when it comes to economic recovery, industry has shown itself to be more resilient against the pandemic and future crises, and therefore it is something that the country must commit to. Having more industry means betting on the modernization of our economic model and more stable jobs, innovation, and the internationalization of Spanish companies. In 2021, we will set out the basis for these changes, and we have a decade to put them into action.</p><h4>PGE, together with European aid, will form the basis of the recovery of the Spanish economy, which you predict to be between 7% and 9%, if European aid is included. What current figure is the government operating on in terms of economic recovery?</h4><p>There are many uncertainties. In terms of the macroeconomic picture, it is difficult for both Spain and international organizations to make predictions. Much depends on the duration of this third wave, although the vaccination process will certainly accelerate the economic reactivation as it starts to pick up speed across Spain and Europe, which is our main export market. The range between 7 and 9.8% is in the official macro table that we presented in November, though it is extremely sensitive to developments. It depends on the pandemic and other uncertainties such as Brexit or the relationship with the President of the US. In this case, Spain and Europe have had conflicts that have generated uncertainty for investors. It is a horizon that will depend heavily on the evolution of the pandemic and whether we can bring an end to it. Spain has a heavily interconnected economy.</p><h4>In terms of industry, how will the general state budgets be divided up?</h4><p>We have two major challenges to address beyond the resilience of the sector itself, where the data we have is more favorable than those of the industry itself. The sector is gradually recovering, and we have to accelerate the twin green and digital transitions. There will be a commitment to digitalization so that it reaches SMEs. We have incorporated a plan in which we will include a service portfolio to develop the training of digital skills, including AI, 3D elements, and traceability, and for that it is necessary get the workforce qualified. There will be significant investment in upskilling the workforce across all sectors of the economy. The green transition, without a doubt, is a bigger challenge because we are currently behind other economies. With COD25 and the pandemic, we have set a good pace in the productive sectors. Spanish industries are committed, and we want to generate certainty and a framework for investment in Spain, a predictable framework to give investors a sense of security when placing their bets on us. We are working closely with the industrial sectors and have created a high-level forum to address the passage through the industry, which is the key to generating confidence in investments in Spain. It is a forum that is able to advise public agencies.</p><h4>Automotive, with a GDP weight of 12%, will receive, according to your statements, EUR10 billion from European funds. What strategy will you follow in 2021 to stimulate the sector?</h4><p>There is good communication with the sector, and we have dedicated spaces, such as the Automotive Working Group, to maintain that direct dialogue. The government plan is extremely ambitious; we have to make a qualitative leap. We have been leaders in combustion, and now we have to do the same in terms of sustainable mobility, considering those security and connectivity issues. Therefore, what is most important is having a framework, which the Automotive Working Group provides. We have to transition toward a more sustainable mobility model, and these certainties will soon pay off so that Spain can continue to be key player in the European market. Although we take risks in tackling revolutionary changes in the automotive industry, the opportunities outweigh the risks. The sector is mature, and we have to find certainty with projects and legal protection. Spain has been outlining a clear roadmap in terms of regulations. It is based on success, working together, and the belief that the strength of the automobile industry is capable of tackling this revolution and will continue generating wealth and employment for Spain.</p><h4>EUR250 million was allocated for the RENOVE Plan, and only 20% of it was used. Its closure in December has been highly criticized. Why was this decision made?</h4><p>The fact that it has been more or less executed is not that relevant. There has been great uncertainty as a result of the mobility restrictions, but it was right to put the plan into place. The results have been heavily conditioned by the pandemic. In 2021, there will still be plans to support demand, and we are working on a reinforced Moves III Plan. We have to sit down with the sector and discuss why the RENOVE Plan was necessary. In addition, the support measures that we approved as part of the Automobile Boost Plan and the ICO Line of EUR500 million that we opened for industrial vehicles has been highly received. Moves III will provide a new boost toward more efficient mobility, and the signs the market is giving us regarding the purchase of hybrid or electric vehicles are incredibly positive. The government is committed to accelerating the development of such electric charging points, and once this is resolved, demand for these vehicles will increase.</p><h4>What priorities does the ministry have for the rest of the year? </h4><p>The first is to accelerate the vaccination process. We are working within the government on a strategic plan for the pharmaceutical industry because we want to strengthen its industrial capacities in Spain and develop and produce vaccines and medicines ourselves. In the strategic reserve, we have the production of masks, respirators, and PPE, and we want to position Spain as a leader since the vaccination process will take years. The second challenge is economic recovery and, above all, giving the most affected sectors the impetus they need to leave 2020 behind, which was the worst in history from the point of view of trade, tourism, and hospitality. The more subsidies, the better, though recovery has to be a priority. We want to emerge stronger from the crisis, and this is an important message for investors. It is not about continuing with the production model that we had; we have to improve the business climate and recover mobility and tourist flows, which is key since it is a big part of Spain. It is our window to the world. The crisis has to help us improve what we already have, accelerate our transformation, and reinforce our production model that needs a decisive boost from public agencies. The millions of euros from the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism give us a sense for hope and help us move forward the necessary investments and reforms that we undoubtedly need.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider Daikin's biggest achievements so far in 2019?</h4><p>Our biggest achievement of the year was being awarded a contract with Grupo Aeroportuario del Sureste (ASUR) for Cancún International Airport. Daikin has a close relationship with ASUR and we are going to replace considerable equipment at the airport. We want to work with ASUR for the entire airport expansion. In the past ASUR has also been very satisfied with our performance in maintaining equipment once installed and running. We are doing the installation work at Cancún International Airport in 2020, and have already started manufacturing the equipment required. The ASUR contract is worth around US$5.5 million.</p><h4>Is Daikin also interested in participating in the new Santa Lucí­a Airport set to be built?</h4><p>Absolutely. Daikin was one of the brands specified for the terminal at Mexico City Texcoco Airport. Therefore, it was not good for us that they canceled and shifted that airport project, but again we are going to invest much effort to do something at the proposed Santa Lucí­a Airport.</p><h4>Which private sector projects were the biggest for Daikin in 2019?</h4><p>In the private sector, it was commercial buildings. Monterrey is one of the core centers for air conditioning because due to its climate. In Mexico City, it was not the best year because many construction licenses were canceled. For us, big projects involve construction of over 10,000sqm and this is precisely the size at which construction licenses were reduced or stopped. Hotels are important for Daikin's business. The company has a big portfolio of solutions for many types of buildings, but hotels are vital for us. There are many hotel projects underway, not just for the big chains, but also for boutique hotels. Those are the ones that not just ourselves, but much of the industry is looking for when it comes to hospitality projects. Los Cabos is another important destination for us, not just for hotels, but also for second homes for the wealthy.</p><h4>Industry 4.0 is a hot topic currently. How is Daikin adapting its portfolio to digitization? </h4><p>This is a big deal for Daikin because we are also following these trends from Japan. We are investing a lot in order to align our efforts with Industry 4.0. In Mexico the demand is not there yet, but Mexicans invest heavily in tech like cellphones and gadgets. So the digitization trend is slow here now, but I believe we are going to ride a wave in one or two years at the most. And Daikin hopes to be one of the first companies bringing in this new technology.</p><h4>What new products and services is Daikin about to launch in Mexico?</h4><p>Daikin D-Net is a new product and service for us in Mexico. It is a platform where we install control systems that connect buildings, for instance to create multi-site supervision from headquarters and for preventive maintenance. It means it is not necessary to send technicians to the job site to diagnose a problem, but monitor equipment remotely and send a technician with the right parts to do the repair. With this platform you can save a lot of energy through efficiency measures that improve the operation of buildings. The Daikin D-Net platform is also an important tool for our refrigeration division. There is competition in providing platforms like this, but Daikin has some advantage because we are the only company in the industry to have also developed refrigeration technology.</p><h4>What is the added value Daikin is offering the Mexican market compared to its competitors?</h4><p>Daikin is probably not the biggest player here because we are new to the Mexican market. But we want to differentiate ourselves in our approach to our customers and the way we serve the market. We try to be close to our customers, such as building integrators and developers to provide them with the best solutions for their particular project or need. We aim at the best of both worlds here by bringing in excellent, but different technology available from the US and Japan. For example, Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) was invented by Daikin in 1982 and none of our competitors can use our VRV technology — it is trademarked. If you go back 15 years no one in Mexico was talking about VRV or Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF). So being a pioneer has given us a significant advantage and a strong reputation because customers identify Daikin with this technology. It was innovative at the time. We believe Daikin is always one step ahead of the competition in terms of technology. Another important and advanced technology we offer is chillers with magnetic bearing compressors, these are very efficient and quiet because they do not use oil, hence no friction, less power consumption and less spare parts required.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2020? Are you investing in new plants or increasing capacity?</h4><p>One priority is definitely to increase brand awareness because we want to grow the business in terms of sales in Mexico. We have a manufacturing facility in San Luis Potosí­, but today we are only using 10% of the land we own there. That plant is currently used for one of our specific technologies called Applied Business. But the plan is to have our air conditioning units and VRV production there as well, not just for Mexico, but for the whole of Latin America. That expansion will happen over the next couple of years. Another goal for 2020 is to consolidate our 2019 joint-venture with the Mexican specialist mechanical contractor, CYVSA. We need to collaborate with them for mutual growth. In 2020, we are also going to invest in our customer experience. It is not just about selling our systems and equipment. We want to ensure owners and users are satisfied with the result because that is how we can be sure that next time the customer thinks about air conditioning, they think Daikin.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Uline is a US-based company that has a strong presence in Mexico. What does the Mexican market represent in terms of current and future business?€¨</h4><p>Uline is a leading distributor of shipping packaging and industrial supplies in the US, Canada and Mexico. We started in Mexico twenty years ago by opening our first distribution center in Tijuana. The Mexican market is important for Uline. Currently, we have two distribution centers; one in Mexicali and another in Monterrey. The Mexicali distribution center measures approximately 300,000 sq. ft., while our Monterrey facility is around 500,000 sq. ft. We also have two sale offices located in Tijuana and Mexico City. €¨€¨E-commerce in Mexico has been growing in the double digits recently, with still much untapped potential. How is this trend impacting Uline and your future strategies for the local market?€¨As an internet and catalog company, the e-commerce growth trend is vital to us. In Mexico, we have seen a huge change over the last 10 years. Almost everyone has a cellphone, a computer or access to one, and there is more access to the internet. Mexico has internet companies providing services to practically the whole country, which makes our website available to everyone. We see the exponential growth of internet businesses and e-commerce in general.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the most opportunity for growth in terms of Uline's products and services?</h4><p>Sectors like the pharmaceutical and medical areas will continue to grow. The hospitality sector has also continued to progress. Aerospace is another sizeable market that will maintain its growth, especially in areas such as Chihuahua, Querétaro, Nuevo Leon, and parts of Baja California and Juarez. All these industries are particularly important for us because they look for a large selection of quality products, quick delivery, and excellent customer service. They are looking for reliable suppliers. In Mexico, if you analyze industry needs, 60% of companies continue to import instead of using local suppliers. Only 40% of industry needs are fulfilled by local suppliers. That is a large market, and we are going to see more people come to serve this market.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the remainder of 2020?</h4><p>Uline's model offers the finest quality and selection of products, with the quickest and most efficient service in the industry. While Uline has found success over the last four decades, and we want to continue to grow our model in 2020. There are more than 4.5 million different sized businesses in Mexico, and everyone can find something from our catalog. We will continue to penetrate the market on all levels. We will continue to send our catalogues to the whole country to ensure we reach as many people as we can. We will continue to promote our website because it is a great tool for all companies, and even more so for PYMES. Since opening our Mexico City sales office in 2019, we continue growing our presence there. We also want to continue growing our presence in northern Mexico. Mexico is a colossal market with many needs in terms of investiture, and I hope investors continue to increase their level of confidence in the Mexican market. We have good people. We are well-prepared, with many technicians and engineers coming out of school ready to work and we need jobs for those people who are newly graduated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main areas of opportunities have you identified within Mexico's energy sector?</h4><p>ATCO is here to remain in Mexico and Latin America to grow our business beyond Canada and Australia and the USA. To grow, the group is seeking Mexican partners who need a financial support and ATCO technical and operational expertise to move projects forward. The energy sector is changing, and we are playing a key role in enabling that transition for our customers around the world. Principally, the company is focusing on the energy transportation and power market, areas where we have a lot of experience. However, ATCO is looking to expand in other segments such as energy storage solutions. The storage segment is a strategic area for ATCO where we have the technology and expertise to provide to Mexico.</p><h4>How much of a budget do you have established for Mexico?</h4><p>ATCO has not yet defined an investment target at the moment, we are evaluating opportunities and partnerships. Mexico is an important market for the company, and ATCO is ready and willing to invest. Partnership is the key to our appetite to invest. Size is not an issue for us; we can take on larger projects. We are long term investor and owner-operators.</p><h4>Why is the company prioritizing increasing its visibility in LATAM?</h4><p>ATCO has an incredible history of delivering innovative solutions for customers around the world. The company is doing an investment plan and evaluating other markets to expand such as Peru and Colombia. We want to increase our portfolio in Chile and Mexico. We want to make sure our brand is better positioned in the region. In 2018, ATCO announced the acquisition of a leading modular building manufacturer, which will now operate under the name ATCO Espaciomovil. With a 182,000 sq. ft. manufacturing plant and 1,300 modular rental units in operation, ATCO is now the largest manufacturer of modular products in the Mexican market, with the second largest fleet of rental assets in the country. The expansion of ATCO's modular manufacturing operations in Mexico builds upon the company's growth strategy for Latin America. ATCO re-entered the South American market in 2016 by acquiring 50 per cent ownership of ATCO-Sabinco S.A, a modular manufacturing operation in Chile, and expanded our global infrastructure portfolio in 2018 with a 40 per cent equity investment in Neltume Ports, a leading port operator in South America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Although 2019 and especially 2020 have been difficult years not only for Qatar but for the entire World, with challenges arising from the hydrocarbons price crisis and Covid-19 pandemic, there have been significant advancements in the country in terms of the three different areas of competence of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Can you share with us what have been the main milestones in this period? </h4><p>The year 2020 witnessed many achievements for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce despite the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus, which disrupted supply chains and normal business operations around the globe. In fact, Qatar led the region in enforcing measures to protect the health and safety of its citizens and residents, while also embracing an integrated strategy to bolster trade and economic activities in partnership with the private sector. The Ministry's multilayered strategy to mitigate the negative repercussions of the Covid-19 outbreak revolved around seven axes. These comprised securing supply chains and the flow of goods to Qatar; protecting consumers by combatting commercial fraud; supervising and regulating commercial activities; bolstering national industries and SMEs through stimulus measures and tax incentives; coordinating measures with various government agencies and industry representatives; processing consumer complaints; and launching awareness campaigns. Incentives and stimulus measures introduced to help navigate the crisis included the allocation of 75 billion Qatari riyals for the private sector, in addition to encouraging banks to defer loan installments and offering companies a grace period of six months. Other measures included exempting the small and medium industries sector from electricity and water fees, as well as rental fees in logistical areas, for a period of six months. The Ministry's strategy not only proved a success but also provided an opportunity for Qatar to draw lessons from the current crisis to further bolster local industries and promote e-commerce.</p><h4>In 2019, Qatar managed to improve again its position and score in the Global Competitiveness Report and the Ease of Doing Business Report. What are the main reasons behind the increase in competitiveness and ease of doing business in the country, and how does the local consumer benefit from these improvements? </h4><p>Qatar has striven to turn the ensuing challenges into opportunities to bolster the resilience of its national economy. We have worked to accelerate the development of non-oil sectors to support the state in its journey towards achieving economic diversification in line with the goals outlined in the Qatar National Vision 2030 and the National Development Strategy 2018-2022. In 2019, Qatar established the Investment Promotion Agency and issued a law regulating the investment of non-Qatari capital in economic activity, allowing up to 100% foreign ownership across various sectors and economic activities. The law offers several competitive benefits to foreign investors, including exemptions from income tax and customs duties on the import of machinery and equipment, and the freedom to repatriate profits and conduct transfers in any convertible currency. Non-Qatari investors and companies are now allowed to invest in the strategic real estate sector through investment funds, and to own properties in several vital economic and tourism areas across the country. Qatar also launched the Single Window, which brings together more than 22 government agencies under one platform to streamline procedures for investors. The initiative aims to stimulate the private sector and enhance its contribution to the economy by facilitating the establishment of businesses, as well as by standardizing business procedures through a one-stop-shop for investors. The inflow of foreign direct investment has contributed to the advancement of a dynamic business environment and cemented Qatar's position as a regional trade hub. This development has, in turn, bolstered the country's economic growth and reflected positively on consumers, the ultimate beneficiaries of a vibrant economy.</p><h4>The first half of 2020 has been a period in which many countries have turned their back on international economic relations and prioritized their internal markets, resulting in international supply chain disruptions. What, in your assessment, will be the trends in international trade and FDI in the years to come, and what are Qatar's priorities in this regard? </h4><p>It is too early for the real impact of these developments to be accurately assessed, but international discussions about how to rebalance the supply chains sector are now more urgent than ever. The supply chains sector should no longer be assessed from a cost efficiency perspective only. Instead, we must ensure that industry is flexible enough to withstand future circumstances to support the development of the global economy. Despite the significant impact that the coronavirus has had on the global economy, Qatar is confident that economies around the world will overcome this crisis, albeit in the context of new dynamics and parameters. Qatar is adapting to the post-Covid era, while maintaining its commitment to a multilateral trading system and to facilitating international trade, to ensure the smooth flow of goods and services between countries. Qatar is also strengthening international cooperation frameworks to ensure trade safety and continuity as the engine for economic recovery. In fact, Qatar was able to rapidly diversify local and global supply chains over the past years, and stepped up efforts to improve its logistics networks, which enabled the country to maintain a resilient, diversified and globally connected economy. For example, in the past few years, Qatar has rapidly established the Free Zones Authority, home to one of the most advanced digital and logistical systems worldwide, providing companies with access to a variety of physical or digital entry points to connect to global supply chains, through advanced communications and transportation infrastructure. The country's unique strategic location, with its international airport and port, also allows major companies to maintain their leadership in the field of logistics services, providing flexible and diversified solutions for firms looking to invest in Qatar. The Free Zones also provide a 'landing stage' for companies looking to partner with major Qatari firms.</p><h4>What will be the key factors behind the expansion and diversification of the manufacturing sector in Qatar in the short-term, and how will foreign investors and the private sector in general contribute to the further industrialization of the country? </h4><p>In line with its long-term economic diversification strategy, Qatar is seeking to further expand its investment horizons and enhance cooperation opportunities between the public and private sectors when it comes to the implementation of projects that contribute to the country's development. Qatar's focus on enhancing national industries and SMEs, and boosting their contribution to the implementation and development of various economic projects, has reflected positively on various sectors. In particular, the industrial sector attracted 263.8 billion Qatari riyals of investment in 2019, a three percent increase compared to 2017. The number of factories operating in Qatar increased to 914 in 2020, an increase of 19% compared to 2017, when the total number stood at 765. Qatar also recently secured the unanimous approval of the GS1 General Assembly to establish a barcode office for Qatari products. The barcode enables the tracking of locally-manufactured products, from the production stage through to retail, both domestically and internationally. This development demonstrates the Qatari private sector's ability to achieve self-sufficiency and to compete on a global level by exporting Qatari products.</p><h4>Recently, Qatar has issued the Law No. 12 of 2020, regulating the partnership between public and private sectors. What are the incentives provided by this law to local and foreign investors? How will PPP projects contribute to economic development?</h4><p>The private sector received a significant boost in 2020 with the issuance of Law No. 12 of 2020 on regulating the partnership between private and public sectors, which represents an important step in supporting and empowering the private sector to contribute to strengthening the national economy, and accomplishing the Qatar National Vision 2030. The law provides a multitude of incentives to both local and foreign investors in terms of risk diversification and mitigation, and improved access to finance, in addition to financial and tax incentives granted to the winning bidder, the company undertaking the project, and its major shareholders or subcontractors. In addition to providing a myriad of incentives to investors, the law facilitates the implementation of PPP projects. This will contribute to the creation of a dynamic business environment that will enhance the performance of the public sector and encourage government agencies to embrace a modern vision in managing national projects, ensuring their effective and efficient completion and enhancing their sustainability at the lowest cost. The law will also contribute to promoting competition and innovation, and to protecting consumers from monopolistic practices, while providing effective solutions to current economic and social challenges. On the other hand, the law provides incentives to the Qatari private sector to expand its operations and participate in economic development projects, thus strengthening the partnership between government agencies and large, small and medium-sized companies.</p><h4>What are the strategic priorities of the MOCI for the medium-term, and how will you contribute to Qatar National Vision 2030 in the same period?</h4><p>In the short-to-medium-term, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will periodically analyse and monitor trade dynamics and key performance indicators across various industries to determine the impact of the coronavirus on the business environment, the private sector and small and medium-sized companies. Based on these studies and its monitoring of capital flows, the Ministry will revise regulations and recommend amendments to Qatar's legislative framework to bolster local industries and vital sectors in line with its long-term objective of promoting economic diversification and bolstering the contribution of the private sector to domestic development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Some of the main companies here are among the largest insurance groups in the world with access to reinsurance services at a global level. The best practices in the insurance industry are applied in Colombia. We recently implemented a European regulation on accounting and solvency. This is a fully developed sector with knowledge of developments around the world. In our case, we have developed a trajectory of 75 years that has enabled us to become market leaders because of the conceptual development that we experienced. This company is characterized by its ability to anticipate changes in the industry, which is due to a constant monitoring of the trends and of a detailed review of risks. We have developed strategies on how to remain competitive. During the pandemic, we accelerated our digital transformation process and adopted digital working methods. We also had to develop several protocols to protect the health of our employees and adapt our operative models to the new reality. Because of that growing digital environment, new digital solutions grew rapidly. We recorded growth rates of 40-50% in digital sales and up to 100% in some cases, such as digital leasing.</p><h4>Your portfolio of products is moving toward digitalization and personalization. How have these innovations performed so far, and how do you expect them to progress?</h4><p>These innovations have been a milestone for the company. We arrived at these solutions not because of the pandemic, but because of the risk and trend management work that we had done previously. The pandemic enabled us to accelerate the entire process, including the development of solutions and making them available to consumers. We have identified two trends through our 'Plan Elige' which is one of our products. First, the Colombian regulators had realized that it must develop a legal framework that allows insurance companies to innovate. Its focus is on start-ups and large firms. The second is that we have managed to bring about change; insurance for physical things was normally covered under property and casualty (P&amp;C) insurance, while life insurance was only managed by life insurance companies. We were able to develop an insurance product, Plan Elige, that combines both things. We also move toward digitalization by changing big part of our operation to virtual channels (Seguros SURA APP, Whatsapp), especially in terms of telemedicine. Our development of new solutions will continue in the future because we are constantly assessing the market trends and customer needs.</p><h4>Seguros SURA Colombia has many subsidiaries across Latin America. What advantages does this present to implement the best practices in Colombia?</h4><p>We have identified several things in the region. We have developed a brand image of a Latin American company for Latin Americans, which is extremely important for us. We are in nine countries, and in each of the countries we promote that Latin American image to help companies understand that we know their needs. This is extremely beneficial to those SMEs interested in the regional market, and for this companies we´ve created a platform called 'Empresas SURA', through which we offer services thought to increase the competitiveness of their business. There is an increase in the number of businesses that have a regional focus, and they want to have presence in Mexico and Colombia, for example. We have started to develop a regional portfolio that responds the company's needs in a Latin American ecosystem. We are developing an image that generates a common language to support businesses in Latin America.</p><h4>How are you engaging with plans of post-pandemic recovery?</h4><p>In Colombia, we are extremely relevant in the health market for both voluntary and mandatory insurance. In mandatory, we are the second-most relevant market player, while in voluntary health insurance policies, we are the market leader. Today, we have conversations with the companies that are working to supply the COVID-19 vaccines in Colombia. Our company actually play an important role in the health sector. COVID-19 will eventually pass, so we should use it to improve and capitalize everything that we learned from this pandemic. In that regard, 2021 is an opportunity for us. I would also highlight the importance of the role of the insurance industry for economic development. The insurance industry seeks to provide more certainty through models that mitigate risks. SURA in Colombia provided services to more than 30,000 companies, and our goal is to improve their competitiveness to support their strategic development. In 2020, we made some relevant investments, such as COP990 billion for COVID-19 response and approximately USD22 million on strategic development. This demonstrates how we are supporting the country in its economic development. In 2020, we generated 2,300 new jobs and opened new offices in health and business services, for instance.</p><h4>How are you planning to increase insurance penetration?</h4><p>One thing that we have worked heavily on is the understanding of consumer trends. We have studies how consumer trends will continue to change in the entire region. We study the impact of technology, social, and environmental factors on consumers. These trends help us understand our customers better, allowing us to provide better solutions through our product portfolio. We have been working on that area for the last four years. The pandemic has taught us some important things, such as the importance of digital transformation. It was a trend that was taking shape, but the pandemic accelerated it significantly. For example, thanks to this digital transformation, we increased the processing of health authorizations to more than 1,300 per minute.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ENCE has become the leader in generating biomass renewable energy in Spain. What can you tell us about the company's development?</h4><p>ENCE Energí­a runs the entire biomass side of the ENCE business. It emerged from a need we saw in the cellulose business to make full use of natural resources. Trees are the source of raw material in the cellulose world, but only the trunk is used while the bark and branches are cast aside. ENCE makes good use of a renewable natural resource. In 2010, we had a strategic plan to increase our biomass plants independently of the cellulose business, and in 2012 we started up the first biomass electricity generation plant in Huelva. In 2014, we set up a second plant in Mérida, and shortly after that the energy reform came in, which included a moratorium on new renewable projects and forced us to rethink our vision. During those three years the moratorium on renewable products was in effect, we focused more on trying to consolidate the market and bought up ENEL and EDF biomass plants in Spain. We also diversified into new technologies at the end of 2018 by buying a thermosolar plant from Iberdrola in Puertollano.</p><h4>ENCE Energí­a has a strong focus on Andalusia. What is the strategy behind this?</h4><p>This surprises people because when one thinks of biomass, they think of forests, and the north certainly has far more than the south. In 2017, we published a decalogue on the sustainability of biomass together with environmental NGOs such as WWF, and we defined what should be considered as biomass for electricity production. The first thing was moving away from the use of wood that can be used for other purposes. We have been diversifying the use of different types of biomass, and we have seen that the important focus is on agricultural biomass; it is much more recurrent, and there are more durable crops. Andalusia is one of the main areas with agricultural resources such as olive groves, citrus fruits, cereal, corn, and cotton. In short, there are a multitude of resources we can make use of.</p><h4>In Spain, wind energy has about 24,000MW installed, photovoltaic has about 10,000MW, and biomass there is only 800MW; however, the advantage is that it is very manageable. What are the benefits and vision expected for this energy source moving forward?</h4><p>We have always defended biomass; we believe it has an important role to play. It is an energy source that carries a fuel charge, although you do not pay for it as such. We are a technology that we are capable of producing 24/7 almost every day of the year. That sets us apart from solar or wind power, which are dependent on weather conditions. At the end of the day, that is especially important. Biomass has other aspects that are hidden behind the electricity bill, and they include the creation of employment and job placement in rural areas and the positive ramifications of this. In just one plant, you can create about 1,500, rural-based jobs. We are developing something that did not exist, such as the use of pruning the vineyards in Castilla-La Mancha. We have developed a logistics platform to collect that and take advantage of it for electricity production, and through it we create jobs. On top of all that employment, our plants pay taxes and, in the end, all the energy tariffs we pay for the biomass plants prove extremely beneficial for the state.</p><h4>With regards to regulations, what is still needed in order to continue promoting biomass in this country?</h4><p>There are sides to this. In terms of electricity generation, we need a stable rate and framework. At the regulatory level, what is most important is that the use of these byproducts is regulated. The burning of vine pruning is perceived as a big problem. It is illogical that an industrial business is required to work within strict parameters, and one can be burning openly in a field a few feet away. That should be regulated. We have an interesting project in Almerí­a where we want resolve the issue of greenhouse byproducts. A million tons of byproducts are generated, and only 35% is managed by an authorized manager. The rest is not used and is thrown across the land in an uncontrolled manner. Our project has great potential since we have ecologists and local administration pushing for it to be done. We do not want subsidies; we want the law to be applied or to have one that enforces proper byproduct management.</p><h4>In 2021, ENCE closed the sale of 49% of ENCE Energí­a's capital to the Ancala Partners fund and sold the Puertollano plant to Q-Energy. Are there other strategic moves planned for 1Q2021?</h4><p>We were in investment mode, which led us to find Transactions in which we wanted to increase our portfolio of projects and assets. We realized prices were skyrocketing, and valuations were extremely high, so we thought it made sense to incorporate a financial partner into the ENCE Energy capital. As a company, we got an interesting assessment of the business, and at the ENCE Energy level an injection of new blood and the capacity for growth and investment. Market prices and valuations remain high, which is to be expected due to positive growth forecasts for the sector, and we are more focused on the greenfield development of the projects that we have rather than on making acquisitions. We are not opposed to continued growing if we happen to uncover interesting opportunities, though we currently have projects in the portfolio that involve a significant investment, photovoltaic projects, and a strategic plan that was put into place in 2019 with the intention of investing EUR600 million. Right now, we are solely focused on growth in terms of self-development.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2021?</h4><p>The main one is to keep the company growing. We also have to complete the administrative processing of projects, which is a complicated and slow process. We have to get everything ready for the biomass auction in order to take on projects and be able to start building at the end of 2021 or the beginning of next year. In the photovoltaic area, things are more or less the same. We have move forward with the projects that we are developing and bring them to fruition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grupo Juste is celebrating its 99th anniversary in 2021. What would you highlight as its main achievements over the years?</h4><p>Juste Group was founded in 1922, almost 100 years ago, and it is a Spanish equity group. My brothers and I are the fourth generation, and each of us have contributed our own strategic discourse and guided the growth of the business. The first generation was my great-grandfather. He was an ophthalmologist and a pharmacist, and he was the founder of the company. The second was my grandfather; they took charge of business development in Spain and began to diversify into other products. My father was the third generation, and he was the one who drove the internationalization and creation of partnerships. He began to look to other markets, mainly in Latin America, and to deal with other therapeutic areas, always looking for a complementary partner who could contribute what Juste was lacking, especially in finance, human resources, and products. He secured well-established strategic alliances, and that is why we have always been such a reliable and well-positioned partner within the pharmaceutical industry. We have gone from being an essentially pharmaceutical group to a wider, more industrial chemical group. We have a greater presence in R&amp;D&amp;I in development and manufacturing, and we are much more open to foreign markets. We have also focused on the first part of the chain, which are the active pharmaceutical ingredients, and on some end products. In the last six to eight years, we have implemented a fairly significant modern business change. What we are especially proud of is the fact that the family values on which the company was founded have been maintained over the years and still today the company operates according to these values, related to the wellbeing of our employees, a positive contribution to society and continuous strive to support the health of patients.</p><h4>How is Grupo Juste's revenue broken down in terms of foreign and domestic profits?</h4><p>85% of our sales take place abroad, so we are a truly international company. We are used to operate in a global market and to adapt our offer to our customers needs. Operating for over 40 years in the field of Contract Media, delivering from large multinationals to local pharmaceutical companies, this can only be achieved by delivering the highest quality in product and service. On a national level, our Farma Division serves hospitals with finished products for Contrast Media applications — we have recently added new products to our portfolio and we continue to search for new contrast agents that can better fit the patients requirements.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected the company, and what actions have you taken to mitigate its impact?</h4><p>The company reacted immediately to the pandemic, starting with activities related to the protection of our employees' health and safety. We implemented remote working procedures, increased and improved disinfection processes, modified our habit to avoid potential exposure, and many more changes that were swiftly put in place and that are still valid today. Additionally, we have been testing all employees regularly, and communicated continuously to generate awareness and commitment, because we understand prevention is a personal habit and goes beyond the professional environment. To support our close environment, we also acquired 16,000 protective masks and produced 12,000 liters of hydrogel, all these have been donated to nursing homes, hospitals and law enforcement. For this effort, we have received two awards from The European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) at the 2020 European Responsible Care awards “Caring in COVID-19 Times."  The awards were achieved in the categories of “Protection of Workplace and People" and “Community Support", which recognizes the important commitment of our people to help society. Finally, from the business point of the view we have not experienced a major impact, we operate in the pharma sector, which has been one of the least affected by the pandemic. We had to implement some strict controls over purchases, supply chain, finance and other parts of the chain to make sure that everything was under control, and in the end we have been able to produce and deliver our customers without any issues.</p><h4>Regarding your portfolio of products and services, Grupo Juste sells oral and injectable radiological contrast media, APIs, and so on. Which of them are most in demand, and what is the group's diversification strategy?</h4><p>Most of the APIs that we manufacture are relatively mature products in all contrast media. Two years ago, we installed a new production line for API dedicated to MRI Contrast Media. This is an area where we see continuous growth globally because of the increased utilization of MRI techniques in diagnostic imaging and the growth of preventive medicine. Our facility of state-of-the-art and it includes some unique production innovations that allow us to deliver the customer with the highest quality standards. Right now, we are in a process of strategic reflection to determine what other APIs we want to manufacture in the future and where we want to position them. Juste can be competitive in product niches. Here, customers value service and quality more and are willing to pay a slightly higher price for it. We are working with a consulting firm that is helping us to carry out research on those markets, based on a series of parameters that we have established. We have also created an advisory council that aids the board of directors and the management team in their focus. It is an ambitious project.</p><h4>You have highlighted the need for a change in the economic model of Spain to place greater weight on industry, digitization, innovation, and environmental sustainability. How do you see this is evolving in Spain?</h4><p>I see it evolving slowly, and COVID-19 has struck right at the heart of our economy, mainly on services. It also highlights the need to support the industrial sector and the benefits that it brings: higher-qualified, longer-term, and more permanent employment, and so on. The areas of Spain that are the most industrialized have a greater contribution to the GDP and have the highest unemployment rates, so we should reflect on this as a country. The key is that long term thinking would be required in order to achieve this change. We are a country with little confidence in industry, but I don't know why. We should help each other, the public and private sectors, because the private sector also needs the public for this industrial development. We should invest in R&amp;D&amp;I as much as possible. When we began this reorganization and restructuring process of the entire company, from a pharmaceutical company to one that works more in chemicals and industry, based on R&amp;D, in the development, production and export of pharmaceutical raw materials, we began to put a greater emphasis on everything that contributes to investment in R&amp;D&amp;I. Innovation is part of our DNA. It is the value that you add to the market, and if your products do not have an element of innovation, then you do not add value.</p><h4>What main priorities would you like to achieve in 2021?</h4><p>We are focused on the safety of our employees, by following the preventive and protection measures against COVID-19. In addition, with our current business right now, we are looking at the whole aspect of mature products in contrast media, the whole aspect of magnetic resonance that we have started and that we are developing, and new applications in the main business of the company. We want to grow in this part, both within our plant and outside of it should opportunities arise as well as add all this to our portfolio in hospitals in Spain in order to gradually grow in the country. Everything that we will work on must entail that sustainability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did you ensure the company remained resilient during the pandemic?</h4><p>When the pandemic hit, our transition to remote working was effortless as we were already in the process of transformation. This was part of the essence of Dell acquiring EMC four years ago: to accelerate its digital transformation. The resilience to face the challenges which came with the pandemic came to us as a natural response and made it easy for us to help our customers and partners prepare for it. When it comes to working from home, we started this 10 years ago. We had a connected workplace for the last decade, and our Connected Workplace 1.0 program has been very successful, where at any given time 30% of our workforce works remotely from home. Now, we have announced Connected Workplace 2.0, where we give employees the option to come into the office one or two days a week. We also support them with incentives to work from home, such as purchasing a desk and so on. We have also seen that among our customers in the UAE, the transition was not as difficult, as many of them had already embarked on the digital transformation journey.</p><h4>What characteristics made your clients resilient?</h4><p>During the pandemic, the UAE government provided strong support to businesses to navigate these challenging times. For instance, it launched a stimulus packages to help SMEs with deferred payments and so on. At Dell Technologies, we launched a USD9-billion fund to help our partners and customers in terms of payment deferrals and, in some cases, convert their service into a consumption model wherever CAPEX could be turned into an OPEX. It was important to us that we stand by our customers and partners during the pandemic and help them out. In addition, we launched Dell Financial Services in three of our key regional markets, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, and in the process, signed an agreement with Abu Dhabi Financial Global Market for an existing license that is registered and supported by our bank in Ireland. This allows us to move up another level and truly support customers that need technology and security but have limited budgets.</p><h4>How is the role of technology different now after the disruption of the pandemic?</h4><p>The pandemic has created momentum when it comes to digital transformation. For instance, our own progress in the last five to six months would have taken five or six years normally. The most important role of technology is business continuity, and the pandemic has proven that one cannot continue to run their business without technology infrastructure. Since I joined the company 15 years ago, the number one aim has been business continuity. When we pitch to customers, we ask if they are ready for an unforeseen disaster. At Dell Technologies, we offer end-to-end transformation and can tailor our offerings to the needs of our customers. This includes edge computing, IoT, cybersecurity, AI, and blockchain. An example of this is a great project we did where we supported the Emirates Blockchain Strategy with a Smart Contracts solution that uses blockchain to modernize vendor registration and tender management and enhance G2G collaboration. We have a nice digital footprint when it comes to technology with our customers across the MERAT region.</p><h4>How do you compare the sophistication of the UAE to some of your other sophisticated markets when it comes to connectivity, infrastructure, and hardware?</h4><p>The UAE is blessed with smart leadership who have deep foresight, support innovation and are able to adapt to global changes and market demands swiftly. The 10X initiatives are driving businesses towards innovation, and the UAE is extremely advanced when it comes to connectivity, with the fastest networks in the world and being the first to implement 5G. Overall, the UAE leads globally in technology, performance, connectivity, resilience, and security, and has proven to be an advanced digital economy. It is the first in terms of competitiveness in the region in 2020 and 19th worldwide. The leadership's response during the pandemic helped assure locals and expats that it would provide support, and enable them to continue living safe and secure lives in the country. We saw a very progressive approach from the key business sectors too. For instance, Emirates Airlines was able to open up its borders before any other airline and said that if a passenger gets COVID-19 in transit, they would receive EUR150,000 as travel insurance from the airline.</p><h4>What is your perspective on cybersecurity, and what does Dell do to protect itself?</h4><p>Within Dell Technologies, one of the key pillars is security where we help customers transform digitally in a safe manner. We have two companies which support our security offerings, the first being Secure Works for managed services that has an end-to-end offering with penetration testing, patching, etc. to act as the eyes and ears of our end customers. One can have the best technology in the world but without the right people to run it, it is useless; this is where Secure Works comes in to assist customers that have limited bandwidth and cannot monitor the data environment all the time. When it comes to security, we come from multiple dimensions with managed security services and point technology with RSA depending on the environment. With VMWare today, we are changing the whole security concept by making it intrinsic to the individual machine on the network side with the virtual firewall.</p><h4>What is your overall perspective of the human capital in UAE?</h4><p>Human capital is a big focus for us and is central to our 2030 social impact goals. We believe in our talent and invest heavily in developing them, not only in terms of technological skills but also on diversity, bias, compliance, sustainability, and ethics. We also support customers extensively on this front; for example, we signed an agreement with the UAE's Ministry of AI three years ago to develop its talent and have another agreement in place with the Ministry of Energy to  provide their talent with internships and exposure to our experienced staff and technology. We are keen to help customers on their journeys; it is not only about pushing technology but also about supporting the communities we operate in, and helping the economy and organizations across diverse sectors. As a company, we have a strong philosophy and a long-term vision to make a difference in every country we operate in.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you please introduce AW Holding?</h4><p>AW Holding is a multinational Group of companies that operates in UAE, KSA, Egypt and recently in Oman, and provides services in 197 countries.  Since inception in 2009, our vision was to be one-stop solutions provider to our success partners. Empowered with 25 years of accumulative experience in different industries and several countries, our key objectives are to support the economy and corporates by bringing all best practices across the globe to the UAE, in particular, the GCC, Middle East and MENA region. Under AW Holding we have three streams, namely; AW Business Advisory and Risk Management, AW Debt Management and AW Translation Services. AW Business Advisory and Risk Management works to identify, assess and control the threats to an organization's capital and earnings, where our Business advisors analyze problems and potential risks businesses are facing and help providing advice, which then guides the investors to consider the best decision. In Debt Management, we have an international remarkable presence and affiliation with the leading associations such as EOS, FENCA, IACC, LIC, GCS etc, AW Debt Management offers Debt Collection, Debt Consultation, and training &amp; outsource services and experts in both B2B and B2C debt collection. With partnership with law firms in the GCC, we have created a product called LDC, (Legal Debt Collection).  UAE being the melting pot of the worlds culture, and having more than 200 nationalities, puts one more stream into picture, which is AW Translation Services. In this stream, it's not about conveying a message from one language to another, it's about adapting the source of the text culturally and creatively to the target audience, it's about adaption and using the latest technologies up to the international standards. Proudly, happily, positively in the first 10 years AW HOLDING, we surpassed our promise to the market "beyond expectation,“ and during the pandemic along with the rebranding—we set our second promise to be "redefining corporate excellence" for the coming years.  </p><h4>How do you evaluate your performance regionally and internationally?</h4><p>In addition to our regional significant presence, we also have a growing share in the international market; Europe, China, US, etc. As of the moment we are handling a portfolio for credit debt management of 50% regional and 50% international and it was during the pandemic that we noticed an inconsiderable increase in business. We are also helping investors, and corporate firms communicate within the MENA region through our AW Translation Services stream. We provide consultations and advice to the startup companies, the existing companies, and corporate companies on how to identify, assess and control the threats they are facing in terms of the capital and earnings through AW Business Advisory and Risk Management stream. Our key goal is to help our partners overcome any obstacles whether such are related to shortage of credit, language barriers, or consultations and advice. This reflects our vision to be one-stop solutions provider.  </p><h4>How do you see your services evolve over time, and were there any changes due to the pandemic?</h4><p>Now, we are working in three industries, Debt collection, Business Advisory &amp; Risk Management, and Translation services. Geographically, we started in Dubai, then Abu Dhabi, then crossed the border and flew high into Egypt, then KSA, then Oman, then the international market. We call this pandemic as a “Reminder“, because it reminded us that we have to be strong at all times, get ready for the future, revisit our plans and visions, give a huge part of our time to our families, balance between our personal &amp; professional life, think and put plans not only for current, and existing threats, but also for the potential ones. It also drove us to work harder, run market search and create new plans. During the peak of the pandemic, we have put together contingency plan for all possible scenarios. The whole world was running smoothly, and suddenly, there was a sharp change, and it required great efforts from the governments and the people as well out of their social responsibility to recover not only to the earlier times before the pandemic, but to better levels.  </p><h4>To what extent is technology important to your organization, and has it changed the way you operate going forward?</h4><p>Even before COVID-19, we were great believers in technology. Since we are players in the international market, we should be up to the level. We have our internal IT Team who works day and night to provide us with new systems, software, and IT products. We are always updated and upgraded to the latest technologies. In fact, during the first days of the pandemic, our internal IT Team created solutions to work remotely with full capacity within few days. Artificial Intelligence definitely will develop into the business world, this is why it is included in our 2021 Vision and Goals. We use and embrace the latest technology trends to push the limits of business, to deliver breakthrough solutions for business and society, to offer new products to the market, and to transform.  </p><h4>What are your strategic priorities for the coming months?</h4><p>We, at AW Holding, during the Q3 and Q4 of 2020 have already been brainstorming for strategies, vision and goals for the year 2021, 2022 and even 2023. We are now mapping out AW HOLDING 2030 VISION, we are not just thinking about the coming months, but the coming TEN YEARS, in terms of our global presence and spread. Our strategic priorities are to support the transition towards local and regional resilient, stable, and sustainable economy, to maximize corporate social responsibility as it is an  imperious necessity due to the current challenges. You could say, you are just a group of companies, how would you support the leadership goal to a sustainable economy? We are serving the national, regional and international market. When you give a hand to the corporate to collect their payment, you are helping this company to stand. We are trying to help the investors stand strong, and keep working, which drives the whole country to a sustainable economy. We can say we are lucky to live in the UAE with proactive leaders. Despite the challenges we are excited with the upcoming EXPO 2020, the big celebration of the Golden Jubilee of 50 years of the UAE and future of SME.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps did you take in your organization during March to May, and what proved that you were resilient in the face of the crisis?</h4><p>Our number one priority — and the reason for our resilience — is our people. We focused our immediate attention on the health, safety and well-being of our team. Ironically, and fortuitously, we carried out a business continuity stress scenario for a global pandemic in 2017. This laid the groundwork for some of the systems we had in place to improve resilience, including a laptop system versus desktop office environment and the ability to access the mainframe remotely through a secure environment. From early March, we operated with a split-team protocol where half the staff were in the office and half were working remotely. This reduced the potential contagion effects of someone testing positive for the virus. We also immediately started outreach sessions with many of our firms with a larger footprints to gauge their risk levels and to discuss potential help needed. From these early communications with stakeholders, we developed a set of regulatory relief measures that would allow remote working and ease regulatory burdens. We also waived a number of transactional fees, allowed longer times in the authorisation process to gather documents, and allowed for extensions of financial reporting dates and audit completion dates. We continue periodic outreach with the major business models of the DIFC including banking, insurance, wealth management, audit industries and law firms. Our banks are providing necessary infrastructure finance in the UAE and in the region. We are already in very early discussions with insurance firms on how to use lessons learned and better prepare for a future pandemic. The wealth management industry has also been extremely resilient as many investors have gone from a passive investment strategy to an active one.</p><h4>How more important will financial technologies be moving forward? How much more room do you see for innovation and development?</h4><p>For the past 10 years, since the previous crisis, the financial services industry has been investing significantly in technology. This has paid off tremendously in terms of financial and operational resilience in dealing with the pandemic. Clearly, the future of finance is based on technology. In particular, in 2020, we have seen a clear acceleration to more digitalised platforms for almost every industry. The financial services industry has to adapt to the fact that people want instant access and excellent customer service 24/7, as that is the future of the industry. The new players on the market right now are the cloud services providers, including: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Alibaba, Salesforce, and IBM. We are only beginning to see the development of the cloud services industry, and the potential benefits and risks that outsourcing brings, even with the significant advances that have taken place this year.</p><h4>How do you see current government support for financial technologies from a regulatory standpoint?</h4><p>In 2020, the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) adopted its own data protection law, which is largely based on the EU's GDPR. I am pleased that GDPR is being used as the benchmark as that promotes some global uniformity in approaching this topic. We are still learning about data protection in terms of how to deal with the privacy of data, and what consumers want in terms of privacy. Data is extremely valuable, so there is a huge temptation to use that data in a way that consumers might not want or might not have considered. Everyone has different views on what they should be able to do with data. However, as data is the key for the world as we move forward, and data protection laws will only get tougher and likely more complex as well to unlock different segments of our lives.</p><h4>How is the human capital management on that side, and do you need a great deal of reskilling, and have you taken any actions towards that?</h4><p>One of the biggest successes we have had at DFSA is the launch of a Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform. We developed this platform as a public-private partnership (PPP). I am a proponent of PPPs as we move into the future. In this case, we have developed a PPP that allows firms and the government to enter cyber risks into a system and share those risks with the entire ecosystem. It has proved to be extremely effective and is catching on now as more and more people are using this system.</p><h4>How has the innovation testing licence program flourished during the pandemic?</h4><p>We had our largest intake ever this year, and there are more Fintech firms approaching us as we speak, wanting to provide innovative products such as robo-advice where you let an AI system take over your investment portfolio. We also have a wide number of different types of firms that want to join the DIFC for elements such as payment services, which is one of the most successfully disruptive elements of technology that we have seen so far. All of this sits within the entire ecosystem of DIFC where there is the DIFC Fintech Hive with an accelerator and incubator, and in a broader sense with Smart Dubai. One of the strengths of the UAE in general is its entrepreneurial spirit coupled with the willingness and ability to continuously reinvent our environment. This is all possible due to the leadership of the country and the ruler of Dubai's vision for the city and his ability to alter his vision as things develop, which is tremendous.</p><h4>What excites you the most for the future?</h4><p>The Expo excites me, and I was looking forward to being able to wander through the Expo grounds in 2020. This is now a year away, which allows the event to possibly be even better. As we think about AI and machine learning technologies, the financial services industry will be delivering products and services differently in the future than we are now. Expo will, no doubt, be a fantastic illustration of our digital future. The pandemic certainly has had negative effects but it also has positive ones as well. It has altered the way we do business, work, and from where we work. There are many people who would like to visit Dubai, so why would they not want to live here now if they can work from here too? Why not work in New York City or in London, but from Dubai? This paradigm shift might change commercial real estate in a negative way, as businesses might want smaller offices. However, it might change residential real estate in a positive way as everyone now needs a home office room with a comfortable chair and desk, so that is an exciting element for our future. I am extremely excited about sustainable finance and the green movement, as the environment is something about which I am personally passionate. Another element of the pandemic that has been somewhat positive is that the air and water is cleaner now that we have had a pause in movement around the world, which has allowed the earth to heal itself slightly. We are focusing on sustainable finance initiatives at the DFSA for the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the unification of the organization progressed over the last year?</h4><p>One of the main milestones that we progressed after 30 months of operating as a unified Intellectual Property Authority is that, by royal decree, SAIP will be linked organizationally to the Prime Minister and His Excellency Minister of State Mr. Mohammed Al Al-Sheikh will chair SAIP board of Directors. This is significant, as few IP offices have linked to the Prime Minister. Saudi Arabia believes that IP should be fully supported and independent, that is why the royal decree has been issued. In addition, SAIP recently finalized the national strategy of IP, which was submitted through the Council of Ministers. We are now waiting for the final approval of this strategy as one of our main mandates. On the international side, we have launched IP20+, which refers to the IP offices operating at the G20. It includes more than 27 IP offices as well as international and regional organizations such as World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), World Health Organization (WHO), European Patent Office, Arab League, Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the patent Office of GCC to discuss global challenges related to IP. Globally, SAIP has also signed number of cooperation programs with International IP offices in order to internationalize our office. We established fast-track examination and a collaborative search program with the Korean IP Office to provide cited documents in order to facilitate the examination of patent applications. We also initiated a cooperation program that allowed experts from universities to provide search reports for patent applications. The number of patent applications received in 2020 is (3,295) and the number of granted patents is 589. We expected a reduction from 2019 due to the pandemic, but it is only 1% less than the last year. When it comes to trademarks, we have received 35,779 trademark applications and have registered 13,659 trademarks.  We have added certain quality layers to ensure that the outcome of our trademark examination meets international standards. When SAIP was established, there were five international treaties and today the total number of treaties is 12 international. We have significantly improved our relations with other key global entities, which has made us a stronger authority on IP domestically and internationally.</p><h4>In what ways did COVID-19 shift your operations and strategy especially related to digitalization?</h4><p>The pandemic pushed us to use digital platforms. Throughout the pandemic, we shifted to working from home and increased our channels to communicate with clients and rights holders to ensure they could reach us whenever they want. We communicated with the main law firms to ensure they could reach us as well and provided them with direct contacts for the officers dedicated to each office. We also invested more in our IT system and expect to see the first profits of this new generation of new SAIP IT system throughout 2021. This will be a complete shift.</p><h4>Have you seen any pandemic specific innovations that have been registered with the office?</h4><p>We have seen many registered innovations such as Tawakkalna, a national application that grants people permission to travel under lockdown during pandemic. There is a new application called Eatmarna and others that were developed in response to the pandemic that have also been registered with SAIP. We have the right platforms at SAIP, and we tried to utilize the opportunity presented by the pandemic to allow people to innovate and learn. In this spirit, we increased the number of training programs at SAIP linked to international organizations by 540% in the first six months of 2020. Saudi Arabia was ranked number 10 internationally in terms of using WIPO platform for IP training programs It is not only SAIP employees who are training but people all over the country as well. We have signed an agreement with different universities and research centers to increase our technology and innovation support centers. This will bring entities together and increase innovation.</p><h4>Are there any advancements in the area of intellectual property that have evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Laws and regulations in Saudi Arabia are one of the main issues in the Vision 2030 reform program. The World Bank's doing business report classified Saudi Arabia and its economy as showing the largest improvement in doing business at a global level, thanks in large part to a series of legal reforms. SAIP is part of this movement and has participated in the process of legal reforms. We have started with the copyright protection law, which is now in the final stage of approval. We have also issued the regulations of optional registration of copyright works to help in documenting the works, and to enhance confidence in the transactions. We are also drafting the protection of geographical indications law, which is a new field of IP to be started in Saudi Arabia, and we are in the pursuing the proceeding of approval. We are revising the Law of Patents, Layout Designs of Integrated Circuits, Plant Varieties, and Industrial Designs. We also issued a Regulation on IP Practitioners and began to train and license them. The IP issue is a global one. We need to ensure we are aligned with international practices, which is why we started to increase the number of international treaties to ensure we follow international standards and give us more access to databases and activities related to IP. Saudi Arabia now chairs and co-chairs about 15% of the WIPO Committees, and this only happened in 2020. This is one of the main achievements in 2020. We signed different agreements with five major offices: Korean Intellectual Property Office, US Patent and Trademark Office, the China National Intellectual Property Administration, the Japan Patent Office, and the European Patent Office. Recently, we signed an MoU with the UK Intellectual Property office and the European Intellectual Property office. The main idea is to strengthen Saudi Arabia and SAIP via these MoUs to ensure we have the proper exchange of information, access to data, training, and human capital activities. All these will help to increase the final outcome of our role, which is the quality of our work. In addition, SAIP has announced the possibility of registering family names as trademarks. These were all huge advancements in 2020.</p><h4>What made the shift in strategy for intellectual property cases to be heard by the commercial court happen?</h4><p>It is part of the Kingdom's work to develop the judiciary and reduce the quasi-judicial committees. All cases related to applications for intellectual property laws will be considered by the commercial court, instead of administrative court “Board of Grievances." This contributes to achieving fairness for intellectual property cases. We have also started to train judges in the field of IP in cooperation with the world Intellectual Property Organization as a part of promoting IP in the Kingdom.  </p><h4>Will the pandemic spur greater innovation or change the way innovation is done in the long term?</h4><p>There was a shift in the way we innovate and our mindset about innovation. In the past, people used to look at innovation in terms of the number of IPs registered. The pandemic has since made a great shift in terms of quality and the impact of innovation. Now, it is not about how many IPs we get but how many IP we utilize. Such a shift will increase impact and will be reflected in different societies. The number of applications may be less than before, but the quality and impact of applications are higher. This has a significant impact on our society, and it will be a milestone even in our national strategy of IP to ensure a higher quality of innovations. This will increase Saudi Arabia's intangible assets. The goal is to see more innovative SMEs with higher impact and intangible assets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[<p>Pedro Duque Duque, Minister of Science &amp; Innovation, was born in Madrid in 1963. He studied aeronautical engineer at the Polytechnic University of Madrid, and went on to be responsible for reviewing future projects for manned flights with the European Space Agency (ESA). He worked at the European Space Operations Center (ESOC) of the ESA in Darmstadt, Germany from 1986 to 1992. He was selected to join the ESA Astronaut Corps based at the European Astronaut Center (EAC) in Cologne (Germany). In August 1993, he began preparing for the joint EUROMIR 94 mission, and was appointed by the ESA as NASA's Shuttle Flight Engineer in 1996. He first flew into space as a member of the Space Shuttle flight STS-95, on a joint NASA, ESA, and Japanese Agency (NASDA) science mission. Between 2002 and 2003, he trained as a co-pilot (flight engineer) for Saiús-TMA, obtaining this qualification in April 2003, and then participated in the "Cervantes" mission, a ten-day expedition to the International Space Station. He served as the flight engineer for the Saiús-TMA spacecraft for takeoff and approach (along with the eighth permanent crew members) and for landing (along with the seventh). After his last space flight, the European Space Agency sent Duque as Director of Operations for the Spanish Center for Support to Researchers and Operations for the Space Station, attached to the Ignacio da Riva Microgravity Institute of the Polytechnic University of Madrid. He was CEO of Deimos Imaging, S.L., dedicated to the exploitation of data obtained by earth observation satellites, from 2006 to 2009, and on July 29, 2009 the Deimos-1 satellite became the first Spanish Earth observation satellite. In October 2011, he returned to the European Space Agency before moving on to his current position.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The national budget for 2021 foresees an increase of 59.4% for the Ministry of Science and Innovation compared to 2020, a total of EUR3.2 billion, the largest direct investment in R&amp;D&amp;I in absolute terms in Spain's history. In general, what is the distribution strategy for this budget?</h4><p>Spain has decided to heavily invest in R&amp;D&amp;I in order to use the additional funds, which are about EUR1.1 billion, to support the reforms that the science and innovation sector needs. We will reform the way in which we hire researchers and use part of the funds to finance this process. It is important to note that we want to stabilize the hiring of researchers, and a large portion of the resources allocated to the recovery plan will be used for research as well as innovations. These funds will be used to foster business R&amp;D processes so that the returns from those new programs can be attained in the short term. We will also consolidate the programs for innovation that we introduced during the last few years. We have an ongoing program to invest in new technology-based companies, but this program has to be further consolidated. We will also upgrade the system so that we have the funds to not only invest in businesses that have demonstrated their ability to transfer their developments into new products, but also invest in the first stages of research processes. That is one of the gaps that we have to cover. We will consolidate the CERVERA program of cooperation within technology centers, and this will encourage R&amp;D within SMEs. In general terms, we are heavily involved in the process of creating new ways of working to transition the innovation process into the business sector. </p><h4>The scientific community, which was badly hit by budget cuts in the last decade, has viewed this national budget with optimism. What is your strategy to ensure the scientific community has better working conditions?</h4><p>The first step is the reform. It is important to create a new mechanism to hire scientists and researchers, and these mechanisms target the early absorption of talented scientists and researchers in the job market. We want this mechanism to be applied to the market as soon as possible, and we want the resources designated for R&amp;D to increase subsequently until they reach average European levels. This should ideally lead to a system that continues to scale up such that it can continually absorb the talent in the market. That is paramount: the early absorption of talent. We want to increase the volume of hiring and the contracting model to hire more researchers.</p><h4>The European average is to allocate 2.1% of the GDP to R&amp;D, while in Spain that ratio is 1.25%. What else can be done to reach the European level?</h4><p>The most important aspect is the Pact for Science and Innovation, a short document that has been signed by nearly 50 organizations, including worker unions, businesses, and scientific organizations, among others. This pact includes a commitment to meet the goals that the EU has set out for every member country, including investing 3% of the global GDP by 2030. Furthermore, of that amount, 1.25% has to be public investment. If we reach that target, we should reach the European average by 2024 or 2025.</p><h4>The ministry has subsidized more than 10 projects to develop vaccines in Spain. Why is it important to continue investing in vaccines in Spain when international vaccines have already been distributed?</h4><p>It is extremely important. First, part of the mission of these companies is to produce the international vaccines themselves. Of the many companies that we have supported through government grants to transition from veterinary vaccines to human vaccines, two of those companies will start to produce vaccines soon. Meanwhile, there are also companies manufacturing the bottling process, such as Laboratorios Rovi. We will continue to support researchers because the knowledge generated is of added value, and we should continue working until the end, if possible. Second, the current vaccines are safe and effective, but we have not had sufficient time to determine if these vaccines are complementary to other technologies based on, for example, the temperature needed to preserve them. The second wave of vaccines could include certain developments carried out in Spain that could be useful as well. We do not know what the geopolitical situation will be in the short term, so it is important to be prepared for anything. It is important to have our own projects, because that is the plan B, and it is important to always have plan B.</p><h4>Congress has created a panel of experts in science and technology to advise on legislative decision-making. What are your views on this initiative?</h4><p>I am extremely pleased to see that this process that we started almost two years ago is gradually gaining traction. It has taken time because the previous President of congress who took some initial steps was later replaced. Then, the pandemic occurred, and there were many things to address. It was also necessary to evaluate the best legal mechanisms to carry out these changes. The panel includes a number of excellent professionals with a pool of scientific knowledge, and it will be able to present these legal changes to lawmakers without any agendas.</p><h4>In 2019, you said Spain would increase its contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA). How has your career as an astronaut influenced that decision?</h4><p>I have been in the ESA for 30 years, so I know how profitable it is to invest in those technologies. Europe is still far behind the US in that area in terms of investment, so we still have a long way to go. The other European countries will increase their budgets in that area, so Spain has to continue to get closer to the European average. In 2021, the Spanish industry has obtained extremely significant contracts, which it could only obtain if the ministry increased its contributions in this area.</p><h4>What is your main priority for 2021?</h4><p>We want to focus on a plan to use the funds appropriately by ensuring that they are able to help the economy recover as quickly as possible and by allocating resources to the required areas. We have some projects that are not general, but specific. One of them is in personalized medicine, which will be launched in 2021. We have a plan for aerospace and strong investments in R&amp;D for sustainability. In addition, by mid-2021 we will have received clear commitments from politicians in the main political parties to continue increasing investment in R&amp;D.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the Indian market, and edtech in particular, play for AWS within the context of its global growth strategy?</h4><p>AWS is a global organization, and India is a key market. We launched the AWS Asia Pacific (Mumbai) Region in 2016 and have been consistently making investments in India since then. We recently announced the second region for AWS in India that will be operational in mid-2022, and this reiterates the strategic nature of India to global AWS business. In 2017, we became the first multinational cloud provider to be compliant with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology's (MeitY) requirements for global cloud service providers. In terms of our India strategy for the public sector, our mission is to make a positive impact on the lives of every citizen of India through an AWS engagement. We want to be able to do this by using technology and frontier technologies such as machine learning, AI, IoT, and blockchain. We see a great deal of resonance with the government, which is also adopting technology in a significant way. This is a great opportunity for us to work closely with the government, edtechs, and non-profit customers in India to help them move to better outcomes using the cloud. In terms of edtechs specifically, this is a vibrant sector not just within India, but also the Indian edtech sector services global customers as well. AWS has had heavy focus on edtechs from an early stage, and the pandemic has significantly accelerated the move to online education. AWS is extremely bullish about the edtech sector given the developments. There has been a multifold increase in online presence, and as much as possible we are trying to ensure that children do not get left behind due to the digital divide.</p><h4>What are your views on the evolving relationship between the public sector and the private edtech sector? What opportunities do you see here, both for AWS and in general?</h4><p>If we look at the Ministry of Education studies released in the last few years, the number of people to be skilled and reskilled in India is estimated to be over 400 million. Therefore, something fundamentally different needs to be done to address that kind of scale, and this is where PPPs become key. As an example, we work closely with NASSCOM FutureSkills, which focuses on nine technologies that the government believes are required for technology reskilling. That becomes a great imperative for us to work with NASSCOM FutureSkills to help that platform scale. There is tremendous opportunity for the public sector and private institutions to come together, as they have already been doing in the past. When we look at Common Services Centres (CSC) as an example, India has over 400,000 centers being used for citizen services. CSC has a digital literacy program called PMGDisha that aims to bring digital literacy to 60 million citizens, and AWS is helping with the training these citizens require. That is a good example of a PPP. Outside of that, there is so much assistance needed for students in rural areas. One example is that of what Learning Matters, an edtech, is doing in a village near Thanjavur in Tamil Nadu. They have developed an interactive app called Tara focusing on the basics of spoken English. This AI-enabled natural language voice recognition tool is powered by Amazon Alexa, and augments what the teachers are doing and helps teach English and other subjects to children. Students in schools with poor teacher-student ratios and teachers who do not have the right qualification to teach English now have a digital teacher who can converse with them, repeat lessons, and provide feedback. This is one way we can really work with edtechs to provide an impact and skills. There is so much to talk about in this space when talking about K to 12 education.</p><h4>AWS has been active in promoting India's edtech start-up scene though programs such as AWS Edstart. What is your vision for the future of Edstart and its impact on the start-up environment in India?</h4><p>AWS Edstart was launched in 2018 and is focused on early-stage start-ups, where we provide them with the resources needed to get them started quickly and on AWS. We provide them with promotional credits, training, marketing opportunities, mentorships, and technical support. It has been an extremely successful program for us, and we are now working with different state governments that are interested in using this program within their own incubators as well. That is a brilliant natural progression for Edstart as a program. We have already seen some very good examples come out of the Edstart program, such as Eckovation which is a great social learning platform that works from the top to the bottom of the education pyramid. The larger opportunity ahead of us is the key. The next natural progression is making sure we scale up the higher education ecosystem in India. The New Education Policy (NEP) that has come through is a move to more experience-based learning rather than rote learning, which is where this can really come together, scale, and take the edtech community in India to the next level. That is the next big opportunity for Edstart to see how we can dovetail it to NEP and take the entire digital change that is happening, make it sustainable, and move to the next generation and paradigm of education in India.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the sector in 2021 and your priorities for AWS during this year?</h4><p>We are extremely enthusiastic about all sectors for 2021. The move to the new digital innovation paradigm is no longer up for debate; the move is already happening. We are just scratching the surface when it comes to cloud today across the world. In India, when we look at all the work being done across the government space and by edtechs, enterprise customers, and digital natives, there is more and more cloud adoption. In 2021, from a government and education perspective, AWS wants to be a part of some of the national platforms the government is creating right now. We are already playing a key and integral part in the way skilling and education is changing in India and how the country is setting up its new NEP. We want to continue working closely with our government stakeholders and customers to help them adopt and absorb this technology as we go forward, so we can help the citizens and consumers of India, who are the ultimate customers for all of us. We want to give them better services and expand the overall reach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GLP Spain Management started operations a little over a year ago, but it was already in the Spanish market before, under the Gazeley brand. Can you elaborate on the presence of Gazeley in Spain and the acquisition by GLP?</h4><p>GLP is a Global company that is focused on real estate for logistics. We started our activities in Spain in 2002 with developments in Madrid and Zaragoza, having a profile of a trader developer back then. We are known as a company that has an excellent customer service. GLP is present in Asia and the US, and we are also present and market leaders in Brazil and India. Europe was the piece that was missing, so GLP acquired Gazeley in 2018. We retained the name of the brand for two years to demonstrate our clients that nothing would change, and we have continued to demonstrate that our customer service experience continues to be the best in the market. We have reinforced our position in Europe by the acquisition of Goodman Eastern and Central Europe, which allows us to have a presence on those markets. Currently, GLP is present in 12 markets in Europe. We have offices in the biggest markets, we are a global business with a local approach.</p><h4>How many assets do you have in Europe, and what is the importance of Spain in your portfolio?</h4><p>Gazeley in the past was a company that systematically traded their assets. In 2016, we sold all our assets in Spain and Italy. As a result, most of our presence was in Germany, the UK, and France. Now, since 2018, we are developing a strong investment strategy to diversify our portfolio. The strategic plan is to grow in promotion by promoting our own products or the acquisition of buildings. We are long-term investors not traders. We have not acquired a portfolio in Spain yet, though it is something that we are looking at, and we will invest when the opportunity arises. We will not invest at extremely high prices. We continue to look at opportunities in Spain, but we will not invest if we do not see a solid opportunity. In Europe, we have around 4.5 million sqm of assets under management, and in Spain we have 140,000sqm of finished buildings and a land bank of 600,000sqm. We have presence in Madrid, Castilla la Mancha, Catalonia, and Valencia, and we plan to develop in the markets of Andalucia and Euskadi. We will alternate big projects in strategic logistic locations, such as the municipality of Illescas the city of Guadalajara and prime areas like a project in Villaverde near Madrid and others in Prime areas of Barcelona market</p><h4>GLP operates in an attractive, profitable, and also competitive sector. What is GLP's differentiating strategy with respect to its competitors?</h4><p>We are long-term investors, not opportunists. We see several investments in the market at this moment that are moving in short-term operations and many aggressive trading operations. There is currently risk in some real estate balances that project rapid increase of the rents, which is extremely dangerous. The margins of our clients cannot afford very high rent increases, and some balances are projected very high increases in the revenues. We have been in this market for 30 years and if we invest, we are doing it based on a fundamental analysis that tells us if the investment is resilient and resistant to cycles. Each organization is very respectable, but we should not forget the essence of the business, the warehouse, and be careful on investments guided by an Excel spreadsheet. There are players with a great urge to spend money but we should recall to responsibility</p><h4>GLP has closed the rental of its first warehouse in Spain to DHL Supply Chain, which will manage the logistics of the European Zalando fashion platform in Spain. What does this project entail for the company, and what are its main characteristics?</h4><p>It is an important project for us that shows that quality is paramount to GLP. We are talking about one of the best warehouses in Spain, which is one of the reasons why our clients decided to join this project. This project shows the essence of our business, which is our outstanding customer service and quality. The agreement was almost closed in March and has continued despite the pandemic. Another significant project during this past year was the acquisition, in the municipality of Sagunto, of a plot of land measuring 140,000sqm, where we could build a 180,000-sqm warehouse on two floors or 90.000m2 on single level buildings. The project can be built immediately. Rent prices in Sagunto are extremely affordable compared to other areas, and it has an excellent location on the Mediterranean corridor, which is why many companies are eying the area.</p><h4>The pandemic has shown the importance of having local manufacturing companies. What's your stake in that?</h4><p>I agree; it has been proven that is important to not to depend completely on one provider, specially overseas providers. We have realized with the pandemic that problems might crop up. We are in a geopolitical context, and the logistics chain might sometimes be prepared for contingencies. We fear this might not be the last pandemic, and we have to be prepared. In addition, more trade wars might occur, so we have to be prepared as well. More companies are seeing the value of having a local storage facility as buffer and to be able to respond to urgent customer needs.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves from your competitors in terms of sustainability?</h4><p>We were pioneers in Spain to systematically get environment certifications in 2003. Back then, investing in these areas in Europe was a plus. Today, it is essential to invest in environmentally friendly buildings. It is paramount to have sustainable buildings if a company wants to stay in the sector for the long term. Some of our buildings are at the top in terms of sustainability. Today, many skilled workers also work in warehouses, so we need to provide them with a comfortable environment. Having warehouses with comfortable insulation or natural light are small factors that help companies retain employees. Workers truly value working in comfortable environments, and we are pioneers in that area. We are working heavily on well-being policies, and we are already implementing many strategies for the people working in our buildings.</p><h4>What is your main priority for 2021?</h4><p>We are focused on sustainable growth. We are in an expansion process in Spain but at a sustainable level. We guarantee for our clients that we will not dramatically increase the price of rents. This will help us build a long-term relationship with our customers. We are looking at responsible growth for the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you characterize the context and challenges of your new mandate as Minister of Education and Human Development?<br></strong>President Nyusi's second mandate started off with the unprecedented challenge of managing the COVID-19 pandemic and implementing extraordinary measures to face the new reality. This second mandate is bound to see, from the start, some change in governmental policies and priorities to keep up with the changing realities. The initially positive prospects for a strong economic rebound in 2020 were crucial to support and implement the government's quinquennial program (PQG) 2020-2024 as well as our Strategic Education Plan (2020-2029), which envisages promoting an inclusive and efficient educational system that guarantees the acquisition of all competences, skills, and knowledge in response to the necessity of human development. We are now coming to terms with the disruptions brought about by COVID-19, which in the education sector has meant the nationwide closure of schools, with a negative impact on the country's socioeconomic fabric. Mozambique has found itself in a protracted state of emergency, which has restricted the activities anticipated in our 2020 Economic and Social Plan (PES). Beside COVID-19, other challenges such as 2019's natural calamities, unrest in the center, and terrorism in the north are limiting our scope of actions.</p><p><strong>What were the main achievements in the education sector over the past years?<br></strong>In the last few years, we took important steps forward by enlarging the educational opportunities at all levels, reducing the illiteracy rate, and expanding basic access to school. We saw an increase in the number of schools nationwide and in the levels of literacy (67%) and numeracy (70%). Concrete highlights include the Revision on the Education National System Law (resulting in Law 18/2018) that established a nine-class basic education, consisting of a six-class primary education system administered by single teacher and a first cycle of secondary education (years 7 to 9). We introduced preschool education as a subsystem to better prepare children for primary school, expanded our strategy with relation to bilingual teaching, and introduced a better formation system for primary school teachers. An important goal has been improving access to education for girls, which reached an all-time high of 48% of all students in 2018. We are doing this also by increasing the number of female teachers in primary school, an important point of reference for young girls.</p><p><strong>What are the main objectives, priorities, and challenges for the Ministry of Education and Human Development for the upcoming five-year-plan?</strong><br>Our ultimate mission is to ensure that all children have access to quality education and the opportunity to conclude a cycle of education, acquiring at least the basic competences of reading writing and counting, which are essential to ensure a better future for our youths. We are investing continuous efforts to ensure to improve the standards and levels of our education system, in all districts of the country. We will pay specific attention to the necessities of the most remote districts in the country, dispatching more professors to these areas, improving the quality of teaching, and involving parents and communities in the process of educating children, so to ensure that all children attend at least the compulsory education cycle (primary education). An important focus from the primary education moving forward will be strengthening subjects related to civic education. We also want to improve the quality of our secondary education to offer better and more equal opportunities to our young adults coming out of school, especially to girls, so that they are ready to access the job market. In this context, we are also implementing monolingual and bilingual education programs for adults. Finally, an important goal is to improve transparency and governance in the management of schools at all levels. The challenges lying ahead of us are numerous, and we are determined to tackle all of these in the coming years—the implementation of the Law 18/2018 will be key to ensure this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In what ways is El Patron disrupting the Maputo nightlife scene?<br></strong>When I decided to venture into the restaurant business, my team and I looked into different trendy locations, from Dubai to Cape Town. We came across a setting in Dubai that we thought we could replicate in Mozambique. In 2015, we came up with the idea of Maputo Sky Lounge, a sky-bar on top of Rani Towers with a 360-degree view of the city and ocean. Due to the currency devaluation at that time, we were not able to bring this project to life but we still have a plan in the pipeline. In the meantime, we opened another location in the heart of Maputo, on Avenida Julius Nyerere. After obtaining financing and 18 months of refurbishment, we opened to the public in November 2019. El Patron offers seating capacity for 186 people with five different environments. We have the first cloud bar as well as the first bottoms-up beer system in Mozambique, with in-house production of beer. The offer is groundbreaking in Mozambique, though what ultimately matters to us is selling experiences.  The restaurant is upmarket, but not necessarily unaffordable. We intend to cater to families up until 9pm, and later on—as the lights are dimmed and the music gets louder—to businesspeople and young people looking for a spot to enjoy the nightlife. We also offer a fully private floor for corporate events or private gatherings. Overall, we hope to replicate this success in other Mozambican cities as well as in Angola or Portugal and become a proper franchise.</p><p><strong>What have been the effects of COVID-19?<br></strong>As soon as news about the pandemic came out, we decided to close doors, much earlier than the state of emergency was proclaimed. We were not even in the first six months of operations, though we did not want to be the first incubator of the pandemic on Mozambican soil. Three months into the lockdown, things look different. As Maputo was fortunate to register a low number of cases, it has become evident that life needs to pick up again, if we want to avoid a deterioration of the economy. We decided to reopen our doors at the beginning of June, abiding by all the necessary measures for restaurants. Of the 83 workers we employ, we were forced to have half at home, although no one has been made redundant, as I believe in the importance of social responsibility. Now, we need to get the word out. We do have a fixed clientele, but many expats have left. We look forward to economic recovery.</p><p><strong>In light of the COVID-19 crisis, what should be the involvement of the private sector in assisting the country during a moment of crisis?</strong><br>All companies should play a role and provide assistance where they can. In the aftermath of Cyclone Idai in Beira, I coordinated efforts to provide relief to families who lost everything. We even raised financing from international institutions to build 3,000 houses. In the wake of COVID-19, we have invested our efforts on two fronts. We firstly assured our employees they would not lose their jobs. In coordination with CTA, we also organized the distribution of over 20,000 kits of food and basic items to people in need. As the president of the Tzu Chi Foundation in Mozambique, I have coordinated efforts to assist the country. We are currently distributing 300,000 masks and PPE, such as gloves and alcohol gel. We recently received 35,000 COVID-19 test kits as well as eight much-needed ventilators, which we are delivering to hospitals and clinics.</p><p><strong>What is your advice to upcoming Mozambican entrepreneurs?<br></strong>My message to any upcoming entrepreneur is to never stop learning. Even now, sitting on the board of seven companies, if I was to enter a new company, I would never enter as CEO. You need to start from the bottom, learn, absorb as much as you can, and work your way up. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you frame International Fund for Agricultural Development's (IFAD) mandate in Mozambique?<br></strong>IFAD is a UN specialized agency that supports government programs of member states. Our main focus is rural people and our work in Mozambique is guided by the five-year country strategic opportunities program (COSOP 2018-2022), which covers three strategic areas: the productive use of water and land; the production of different value chains within agriculture and fisheries; and access to rural finance. Ongoing projects include PROMER, a USD66-million market linkage project covering the central and northern provinces; PROSUL, a USD44.9-million value chain project covering the three southern provinces; and REFP, a USD72-million project providing rural finance, such as community-based financial institutions, a line of credit, and matching grants. In February 2020, IFAD and the government of Mozambique approved two new projects: PROCAVA, a USD150-million, 10-year program for developing five value chains in 75 districts country-wide, and PRODAPE, a USD50-million, six-year project to support aquaculture development in 23 districts in central and northern Mozambique.</p><p><strong>Are there specific focuses that IFAD has incorporated in its mandate in Mozambique?<br></strong>We work with the government to push for agricultural transformation, with particular attention to developing value chains in the agriculture and fisheries sectors. IFAD's investment is contextualized and supported by empirical field evidence. For instance, Mozambique organized a Blue Economy conference in 2019, which was an important opportunity for the government to demonstrate its increased attention for sustainable use of sea resource. We aim to increase the benefits to the small-scale fishermen, as the scale of their activity is in most cases at subsistence level. For this reason, we brought to the government's attention the importance of a separate three-mile strip in the coastline exclusively reserved for artisanal fishers. A second area of focus is climate change. To this end, PROSUL was the first project in the whole family of IFAD supported projects that was designed with specific intervention to support the adaptation and resilience to climate change. A third area of focus is nutrition development, which is a critical area for a country where the malnourishment rate for children under the age of five is 43%. We always make sure to focus on gender balance, in particular the role of women in agriculture, who represent more than 70% of the workforce in the sector, and youth.</p><p><strong>What role is IFAD playing in coordinating the response to COVID-19?<br></strong>As an international organization supporting the agriculture sector, and considering that COVID is a cross-cutting pandemic requiring a dedicated response from the agricultural sector, IFAD is engaged in the preparation of instruments for supporting the agriculture sector to respond to the current situation. This will require IFAD and all partners of the agricultural sector to provide coordinated support through the provision of inputs for agriculture, especially quality seeds, to ensure the continuity of production and availability of food. These are seeds for cereals, legumes, roots, and tubers such as cassava and sweat potatoes, which the provinces rely on.</p><p><strong>Is the crisis changing the scope of your work?<br></strong>Indeed, the challenging environment of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis required IFAD to adjust. IFAD is primarily a development organization that intervenes on the front of sustainable development by putting together mechanisms for availability of inputs, extension, and advisory services for farmers, including access to markets and availability of innovative rural financial services and products. However, after the two cyclones affected Mozambique in 2019, IFAD found itself duty bound to channel some of the resources from the ongoing projects to supporting the rehabilitation of infrastructure that was destroyed. The same applies for the pandemic. IFAD had to repurpose ongoing investments and create a new instrument in the shape of the Rural Farmers Stimulus Facility, aiming to enhance the country's capacity to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you give us an overview of the institution and its mission?<br></strong>FFH is a government entity that was established in 1996 and given financial, managerial, and patrimonial autonomy to provide a solution to the housing crisis in Mozambique. At the time, there was no institution with enough financial strength to develop the government's ambitious housing programs. We are now approaching our 25th anniversary. In this time, we have provided housing to over 25,000 people. In 2010, we reviewed our terms of responsibilities with the goal of broadening the FFH's competencies in the field of urbanization. We started looking at ways to partner with the private sector and target broader segments of society. Indeed, the issue around housing affects different levels of society and requires different solutions. The rationale behind the shift from catering exclusively to lower classes to including other segments is to generate revenue and eventually reach self-sustainability, so that FFH is able to provide a solution to the poor without weighing on the government's pockets. One project that was born out of this was the ongoing Intaka project, which aims to build 5,000 houses. The project had a few setbacks due to the financial crisis since 2015, though we are on track to deliver the promised result.</p><p><strong>What is your biggest project in the pipeline?<br></strong>We recently launched a new ambitious project to build 35,000 houses, 15,000 of them in the southern provinces, 10,000 in the center, and 10,000 in the north of the country. The goal of this is to tap into the housing demand in the country and provide an affordable solution to the public, thus bridging the inequality gap and promote financial inclusion. For this project, we partnered with China-based CITIC. The idea behind this project is to create new centralities in the different regions of Mozambique, with all the basic necessary infrastructure. These new centralities will transform the preexisting urban areas close to the projects, which are increasingly overcrowded and are unable to respond to the housing and infrastructure demands of the public. Our forecast is to kick off work soon and complete construction within three years. One of the highlights of this project is that buyers will be able to extend the due payment period for up to 30 years. Financial inclusion is our main underlying goal. The project is for everyone, for government employees as well as the private sector. The profile we are targeting is young mid-level technicians, nurses, teachers, civil servants, and so on.</p><p><strong>What are the goals for 2020?<br></strong>In 2019, we gave new shape to our strategy, which is now called Habita Moçambique. Summed up, our goal is to focus on our initial mandate, i.e. to build houses across the whole country, but to find new partnerships and financing modes. We are working on this framework and studying all the different segments. In terms of construction work, we are looking to complete the Intaka project, as well as kick off works for the CITIC project. Our goal for 2020 is to build around 500 houses, 300 for the lower-income groups and 200 for middle-income groups. We also want to revitalize a series of projects we have with our partners, for example the 240 apartments, currently closed, at Vila Olí­mpica, or the USD33-million investment from India's Axis Bank to finance housing projects in Mozambique.</p><p><strong>What are the priorities for president Nyusi's second mandate?<br></strong>The housing issue is an area that taps into various value chains that concern the whole economy. As head of FFH, there are a number of challenges we want to see the president tackling. We want to see solutions that don't just benefit our sector but the economy as a whole. We need to see massive job creation to boost purchasing power and quality of life. We want to see centralized efforts regarding industrialization, so that Mozambique can stop relying on imported construction material. Another challenge is to expand urbanization plans and find alternative solutions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the impact of COVID-19 on the transportation sector?<br></strong>Due to globalization and the growing interconnectedness of the global supply chain, the effects of a global crisis like COVID-19 on the global transportation sector are enormous, and Mozambique has been no exception, especially considering the initial shock of China's lockdown and the reduction in exports for Mozambique. The pandemic has affected air and road traffic the most. Our preliminary results reveal 84% losses in airlines revenues and a 25-50% reduction in road traffic. At the same time, we have seen a 6.3% increase in railway traffic, 5.9% in port traffic, and 50% for communications. COVID-19 has affected the development of major projects, such as the rehabilitation of the Machipanda railway line, the Xai-Xai airport, and the Port of Nacala. At present, we are doing everything in our power to minimize the impact of COVID-19 through the adoption of mitigation measures and multi-sectorial collaboration.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges and opportunities in the transport and logistics sector?<br></strong>The prospect of mineral resources and gas extraction creates unprecedented momentum for the development of infrastructure, logistics, and transport, which will benefit the whole country. Driven by the necessity to link the Moatize coal mines to the ports, we are seeing the completion of the existing railway-port system in the center and north regions, with a focus on the corridors of Nacala, Beira, and Maputo. One of the goals of the government's five-year program is to enable our railway-port system to transport larger volumes of cargo. We want to increase the current volume of 48 million tons per year to 82 million by 2024 through a number of actions. In 1Q2020, we started working on the Ressano Garcia railway. In the center, we are working to increase the capacity of the Machipanda railway from 1.5 million tons per year to 3 million. At Porto of Beira, work is ongoing on the new coal and mining terminal with 20 million tons annual capacity and a multi-use dock to reduce congestion at the cargo terminal. In the north, we are seeing the implementation of phases I and II of the rehabilitation and modernization project of Nacala port to increase handling capacity from 100 million TEUs to 252 million. Finally, Pemba is seeing the construction of a bulk cargo terminal to serve the oil and gas industry. There are also plans for the expansion of Pemba's commercial port and the construction of a transit cargo terminal for the mines in Cabo Delgado. The implementation of all these projects is generating opportunities and capital for the development of logistical solutions across the country.</p><p><strong>From a regulatory perspective, what improvements are needed by the sector?<br></strong>In the transport and communications sector, private-sector intervention has played a fundamental role in building large infrastructure. Being aware of the need to improve our competitiveness and further simplify our procedures, we are currently working on a port law as an instrument to regulate the sector. Mozambique enjoys a great strategic location. Our responsibility is to leverage this comparative advantage and put in place all the right enabling conditions—from regulation to infrastructure—to make Mozambique a logistics hub in the SADC region. This regional perspective is one of the main focuses of the government's recently approved Transport Integrated Development Strategy.</p><p><strong>What progress has Mozambique seen in the aviation space?<br></strong>Our vision for the future is to conceive of airports not only as stations for airplanes, but as hubs with an impact on urban growth and economic development. Our priority for the next five years is to make flying more accessible, develop infrastructure, and promote integrations. We want to encourage the entry of new operators in the country and expand the network of accessible destinations. We also want to increase the number of cities covered by LAM. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of APEBI?</h4><p>APEBI represents digital, telecommunications, and innovative companies. We connect this community to the largest players in the market, which together represent more than 80% of the turnover in the sector. Since the beginning, we defined five axes for our mandate: digitally transforming all sectors of the economy; gathering data; nurturing a close relationship with neighboring countries; promoting digital ways of doing business; and sustainability.</p><h4>How has the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way of doing business in Morocco?</h4><p>Every revolution arises after a great crisis. Now is the time for the digital revolution. Before the pandemic, we realized that certain groups in the country were hesitant when it came to digital transformation, e-commerce, e-governance, and so on. Digitalization was rarely framed as a priority for the country. The pandemic has shaken the foundations of our system, forcing us to adopt approaches and ways of doing businesses previously unthinkable. For a long time, we have mainly been discussing how to digitalize, and now that are forced to do it, we are discovering that digitalization represents not only a comfort, but also a tool to save the physical and psychological wellbeing of the world's population and the global economy.</p><h4>From your experience at APEBI, what solutions can digitalization offer to the current situation?</h4><p>At the outbreak of the pandemic, we sought ways to use technology as a means to inform the public and limit the spread of the virus. We turned to a start-up that works on AI and big data. In three days, we developed a prototype with abundant information based on trends in the worst-affected countries to help the Ministry of Interior anticipate the different phases and introduce the right measures. At that point, we realized Morocco was ripe with skills and potential to develop other similar initiatives. We launched a nationwide call for projects, Hackcovid, targeting any start-up, student, or individual with an idea to assist the country during the outbreak. Within 48 hours, we received 150 digital projects, of which we selected about 30 in fields such as security, food safety, health, and economic competitiveness. Successful examples are the COVID19 tracker, mobile payment solutions, chat bots that can answer questions about COVID-19 in Darija (Moroccan dialect) or French, a solution that will connect all the grocery stores in the neighborhoods to transmit aid, and a social network for the healthcare industry that allows information to be conveyed in real time. Our role has been to mobilize a large number of computer specialists and coders to bring these ideas to life, and to create connections with private or public partners. We are now looking to launch Hackcovid Africa with about six Northern and Western African countries. Morocco is among the first countries to be affected by the pandemic on the continent, so it is important we share any progress we have made. Equally important, Hackcovid Africa will support our ongoing project for the creation of an African confederation of technology to mutualize our common problems and share our progress.</p><h4>What is your vision for the Fez Smart Factory project, which you are launching as the director of Alten Maroc?</h4><p>We launched competitions in several universities to find innovative start-ups in that could nurture Moroccan competences and respond to the future needs of the market. In this context, we landed in Fez, which can be Morocco's potential Silicon Valley and also happens to be the birthplace of Alten Maroc. We wanted to create an Industry 4.0 pole to boost the digital and creative industries in Fez and bring the market closer. Within the framework of the CGEM, we brought together the digital commission, the digital economy commission, the start-ups commission, the employability commission, and the VSE-SME commission, to create a technology park. Besides being a space for the incubation of star-ups, this is primarily an integrated zone where suppliers and customers share the same space and where jobs and opportunities are created.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Banco Letshego grown its operations in Mozambique, and how satisfied are you with your YoY performance?<br></strong>Letshego's group vision is to become a leading African financial inclusion group. Banco Letshego has been in Mozambique for nine years now. We started tackling the market through lending to government employees, which was an untapped niche with strong demand. In the first year, we recorded almost 8,000 customers and MZN570 million in terms of our loan book to the government. After the first few years, we pushed for a diversification strategy to increase profits. In 2016, we were granted a commercial banking license. We started as a micro-bank and later branched out to receive deposits through current and savings accounts. We started offering additional services through tech platforms, processing customer loans through WhatsApp, and engaging customers through web forms and Facebook campaigns. We keep growing YoY, and 2019 was the best year ever in terms of results, recording a profit before tax of MZN986 million. Diversification has been a key factor in our growth. We cannot compete with traditional banks in Mozambique in terms of margins and have always strived to find niches to grow and get low cost of funds. I am extremely pleased with our performance in Mozambique and the team that made it possible. Of the 11 markets we cover, Mozambique is now number three in terms of overall operations, following Botswana and Namibia. In terms of the Mozambican market, we swing between sixth and seventh place out of 19 banks looking at various ratios as per KPMG and the Bank Association Survey. This is particularly impressive given that the Mozambican banking sector has been traditionally dominated by four large banks. Letshego looks like a small bank; however, we are solidifying our position year after year.</p><p><strong>How is Banco Letshego tackling financial inclusion?<br></strong>We have been targeting financial inclusion since we launched our agency banking model in 2016. One of the objectives of financial inclusion is reducing the distance people have to travel, which reduces the cost of transactions. Through our agency model, we place agents close to the customers, who can reach out directly to them and do not need to travel. Thus, we partnered with a few organizations to reach unbanked rural segments of the population and offer them financial services, executing transactions for them. We are gradually expanding the goal of reaching all provinces: from the branches in each provincial capital, we reach all the rural communities. So far, we have reached 85,000 loan customers and savings of almost 40,000. Through our efforts, we are contributing to the government's 2016-2022 agenda to expand financial inclusion. We are seeing significant improvement in levels of financial inclusion, though we would advocate for some improvements in regulations from the central bank. A priority issue is to implement liquidity requirements for agents. We need to influence the change of agent regulation to allow other players to act as agents. Second, we need to allow liquidity to the agents and pass liquidity to the other agents. A third aspect is access to official documentation such as IDs in rural areas, which is often difficult to retrieve. We need the government to allow other means of identifying customers. In our agency model, we operate authentication with biometrics, enabling customers to carry out transactions through fingerprint authentication.</p><p><strong>What are your priorities for 2020?<br></strong>Currently, we are piloting a solution with MasterCard called Tap &amp; Go, wherein during the one-year pilot program we have been able to bank 107,000 customers. We are now finalizing a few regulatory requirements with the central bank to go commercial. Once out, this will be a major success. Another priority is micro and small enterprises (MSMEs). Because of COVID-19, we had to push this focus of our agenda for 2H2020, when we will start providing loans to this segment. There will be a pilot in 2020, and depending on the results we might be extremely strong in 2021 in MSMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the main task of AIMO?<br></strong>AIMO groups over 300 members from all the sectors of industry, including major companies, SMEs, and business associations. Our main objective is to engage with the government to remove all fiscal and financial barriers and create a business environment where all industries can easily develop their activities. A central concern is improving the competitiveness of our industries to increase our relevance regionally and globally. Therefore, our agenda includes the implementation of training programs and assisting local companies with certifications, accreditations, and access to technology and innovation. We also collaborate with other sectors to enable the growth of our local market. One of our main objectives is to integrate the energy sector and agro-industry. With a long coastline and vast arable land, agriculture has  huge potential to transform industry in Mozambique and serve the regional market. The potential is massive. Finally, we want to push for infrastructure development in the country and the integration of the transport, infrastructure, and financial sectors.</p><p><strong>Are there specific policy recommendations that AIMO plans to advocate?<br></strong>We are currently engaging with our partners to develop a framework that will allow the industrial sector to be attractive in the eyes of the financial institutions. This is critical for the development of a long-term policy to respond to industrial demands. The local banking sector is dominated by commercial banks, and we need more action on the production side, not just by providing incentives for industrial development but by creating specialized banks, such as development banks. Such initiatives can only come from the central bank or the finance ministry. Interest rates are still too high for local industries to be truly competitive—they are the reflection of a banking sector primarily focused on consumers. This is a significant challenge as the government does not have enough funding, but it is a priority. I would like to highlight the maturity of the dialogue between the public and private sectors, benchmarked by the 12 points of the World Bank's business environment indicators, about the removal of barriers to improve the overall business environment. This is an ongoing process, with new challenges emerging every day, but there is a strong commitment on both sides.</p><p><strong>In what ways can COVID-19 represent a learning process for Mozambique's industrial sector?<br></strong>COVID-19 is bringing two sets of challenges to the fore, which will expose the country's weaknesses and unpreparedness. One is related to health, as we do not have a strong health system in the country. If nothing, this will be an opportunity for us to come together, realize our weaknesses, and strengthen the system. The other issue will be the severe economic impact on our market and industries. We thought 2020 would the year of economic recovery for Mozambique, with positive indicators such as renewed political stability, increase in FDI, and the prospects of future gas revenues; however, our economy is too susceptible to unforeseen challenges. We cannot just wait for economic recovery; we need to work on producing effective policies for the creation of a healthy business environment to allow businesses to develop and motivate entrepreneurs. We need to rethink our economies, not just as Mozambicans but as Africans, to find our own solutions. We do not produce the products that we need on a daily basis, and certainly not on a large scale. In times of crisis, like the current one, this becomes a massive problem. We cannot rely on imports for our local needs; we need to write a new paradigm. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We start today an important step on our historical path as a people and as a nation, which will elevate Mozambique to a new height of harmony and development. It is with great honor and humility that I assume the highest office of the state and the nation, as the fourth president of the Republic of Mozambique. This is the mandate that millions of Mozambicans have conferred to me, in yet another process of democratic elections, to lead this great nation for the next five years.</p><p>I represent a new generation that has inherited enormous successes and stimulating challenges. We have all inherited the responsibility to preserve the conquests achieved by our people during a path led by visionary leaders who have fought for the freedom and wellbeing of all Mozambicans. The wealth of our inheritance is anchored on three main conquests: independence as the starting point for our nation; national unity as a precondition to building a democratic, united, and prosperous Mozambique; and peace as a precondition for economic and social development. These are solid conquests for all Mozambicans, though none can be considered definitive without further consolidation. We need to make sure that never again will Mozambicans live under the threat of fear and weapons. We are all called upon to participate in the educational life of our nation to promote peace, harmony, and social solidarity as a collective culture in our everyday lives. I am aware of the necessity to reinforce the requirements of our judicial institutions to preserve law and order for our hardworking and peaceful people. As head of state, I will prioritize openness and constructive dialogue with all political forces and civil organizations to promote harmony. Rest assured I will do everything in my power to prevent that. Never again will brothers turn against their brothers in Mozambique. I will vigorously defend human rights, in particular the right to life and the fundamental liberties of every citizen. The challenges that lie ahead of us will certainly require new collective and individual attitudes. This entails the courage to make changes, but these changes must be made in the most democratic, institutional, and responsible way.<br></p><p>I assume the command of the state and government, inheriting a country experiencing great socioeconomic growth, resulting from the efforts of previous administrations. Mozambique is blessed with natural resources, especially arable lands, forests, mineral resources, and fisheries. The recent important discoveries of coal, gas, and heavy minerals place Mozambique on the global radar as a preferred destination for investments. Through this government, I will guarantee that all actions of research, production, distribution, and industrialization will be made in a transparent and responsible way, contributing to the expansion, transformation, and modernization of the economy. I will fight to ensure a growing integration of Mozambicans in all investment projects, especially in natural resources. My government wants to become a strategic partner in the affirmation of a robust entrepreneurial class of Mozambicans. I want our state and our people to be the real owners of the wealth and potential of our country.<br></p><p>We already know the importance of solidarity from countries around the world, and we want to recognize more and more the contribution of all who will be interested in investing, working, and living in our country, respecting Mozambican laws. My government will promote a balanced and sustainable macroeconomic environment to ensure a secure climate, investor confidence, and return on investment. We want to build a nation that bets on human capital formation and development as its active principle. We intend to invest more in the development of Mozambicans across the country and promote the creation of new employment opportunities on all levels. In the middle-to-long term, we seek to visibly increase public revenue, national average income, and per-capita income. We will continue investing in traditional sectors such as agriculture, fisheries, agro-industry, transport and services, and tourism, all of which hold great potential to create employment.<br></p><p>We want Mozambique to continue to be referred to as one of the countries with the highest growth rates in the world. However, the wellbeing of the average citizen is not measured solely through macroeconomic indicators. Vast segments among our rural, peripheral, and urban populations live in poverty. This is exacerbated by the fact that we are a prevalently young nation with high demographic growth. The forecasts are clear: by 2025, we will be 33 million. We need to lay today the fundaments for this not-so-distant future. We need actions, not words. I intend to create and lead a pragmatic government, simplifying its structure and focusing on concrete problem resolution on the basis of justice and social equality. This government will strive to reduce costs, fight excessive expenditure, and apply responsible management. The epicenters of my government will be job creation, infrastructure construction, and rural development. I will not stop until the whole country is paved with roads that are accessible all-year round, enabling the free circulation of people and goods. We want to promote the necessary investments to improve our road network, railways and port system, and air and sea transport to ensure all citizens can travel safely within the country. We want to implement strategies to improve living conditions for rural and urban families. We will increase support to SMEs to generate more employment, prioritizing the participation of young people and women in the country's social and economic development. We will further pursue the process of decentralization and de-concentration of competences and resources to boost rapid development across all territorial units. We want to implement development programs and strategies for the districts, where people co-exist with real problems. Finally, I want Mozambicans to live in a country with electricity, a diversified energy matrix, greater access to potable water, health structures, and universal access to information technologies and communications.<br></p><p>Agriculture is the fundamental basis of our development, as defined in our constitution. Thus, we want to dedicate special attention to the promotion of public and private investments in agriculture, farming, and fishing; provide support to rural families and incentives to farmers; industrialize agriculture; and focus on food production and food security as a basic human right.<br>I know this commitment that I am taking in front of the nation and the world requires great responsibility, sacrifice, and hard work. Let us join hands and walk together as brothers to build a better Mozambique. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2020 marks the 45th anniversary of the independence of most former Portuguese colonies in Africa, including Mozambique. How have relations between Portuguese-speaking countries evolved over the years?<br></strong>The creation of CPLP in 1996 is evidence of how relations have developed between CPLP member states. After the 1974 revolution in Portugal and the following independence of Portuguese-speaking African countries, there was an initial period of mutual adjustment, but since then all the countries have strengthened historic, cultural, and political ties and increased cooperation based on the guiding principles of sovereign equality between states, non-interference in internal affairs, respect for national identity, reciprocity of treatment, and the promotion of peace, democracy, the rule of law, good governance, human rights, and social justice. Although CPLP is still a young organization, its performance in terms of the promotion and diffusion of the Portuguese language, political and diplomatic consultation, and cooperation in all domains, including education, health, youth and sport, defense, justice, food and nutrition security, and digital governance, among others, is significant. As a result, CPLP has been gaining international recognition, which can be measured by the growing number of countries that have expressed their interest in becoming associated observers. From only three observers in 2014, CPLP now has 19, and this figure is set to pass 30 by the next CPLP Summit in 2021.</p><p><strong>How does the CPLP seek to remain relevant today?<br></strong>As with all international organizations, CPLP's challenge is to respond adequately to the needs and demands posed by its member states and their citizens. I will give two very concrete examples. Firstly, CPLP is currently developing a domain that was not originally among its central objectives: economic and business cooperation. Over the years, this domain has been recognized as crucial for deepening the relationships between CPLP member states, as it contributes to job creation, advancement of technology, economic progress, and the well-being of citizens. My second example is the issue of mobility. Since 2002, with the Brasilia Agreements, we defined the goal of facilitating the movement of citizens across CPLP member states. The current Cape Verdean presidency of CPLP has made significant progress in negotiating a draft mobility agreement, which we expect to conclude and approve at the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government in July 2021. The completion of this agreement will contribute to the public recognition of CPLP's added value and of its constant capacity to adapt and evolve in accordance with the wishes and needs of its member states and citizens. Finally, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, CPLP was forced to redefine priorities and either postpone or hold several events and meetings virtually. We are determined to continue to be relevant and active, using the mechanisms and networks of cooperation and information sharing that we have in place to redefine our own priorities.</p><p><strong>How does CPLP support Mozambique?<br></strong>Mozambique is a founding member of CPLP and remains extremely committed to all the organization's activities and initiatives. It has presided over the organization twice, from 2000 to 2002 and from 2012 to 2014. CPLP has been following the evolution of the Mozambican democratic process, namely by sending electoral observation missions to monitor electoral processes in the country. In March 2019, in the face of the devastation caused by cyclones Idai and Kenneth, CPLP made the unprecedented decision to create an emergency fund, quickly mobilizing around EUR1.5 million in contributions from member states, CPLP associated observers, civil society entities, and individuals. It was an exceptional demonstration of solidarity, empathy, and community. CPLP fully respects and promotes the priorities set by the national authorities, thus promoting aspects such as national appropriation and capacity building. From its outset, the CPLP Strategy of Food and Nutrition Security benefited from the strong impetus of the Mozambican rotating presidency of CPLP in 2012-2014. This strategy is currently recognized internationally as an example of good practices in the field of capacity building and ownership by its beneficiaries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What impact do you expect COVID-19 to have on the process of economic recovery in 2020?<br></strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative health and economic impacts on the Mozambican economy. Mozambique was on the path of economic recovery from the devastating effects of different events, including cyclones Idai and Kenneth in 2019. COVID-19 has further hindered the country's short-term growth prospects for 2020 and is expected to have a negative impact on economic activity, due to travel restrictions that affect demand for exports of national products. Additionally, the reduced demand and decline in commodity prices negatively affect investments in the extractive industry sector, including gas and coal, which are two of the country's major industries.</p><p><strong>Are you optimistic about the future of FDI after COVID-19?<br></strong>We remain optimistic about the future. To mitigate the impact of the pandemic and preserve macroeconomic stability, the government has devised several strategies to improve the business environment through the support of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises, prioritizing the adoption of ICT and facilitating business in productive sectors in Mozambique; it has also increased spending in the health sector and improved social protection to the most vulnerable. Various measures have been put in place to promote production of essential goods, facilitate the import of raw materials, and simplify procedures through the authorization of advance clearance and exemption from payment of VAT from basic products. Identified strategies aim to boost production and competitiveness at the national level, leveraging the use of internal national resources that can boost value chains and encourage modernization and diversification of the economy. Specific credit lines have been created to support national companies in priority sectors of activity—agriculture and agro-industry, trade, and manufacturing—with the goal mainly to preserve productive capacity and promote job retention.</p><p><strong>What sectors of Mozambique's economy are most in need of FDI?<br></strong>Currently, the sectors with great growth potential and good investment opportunities that continue to grow and are proving essential to guaranteeing the production, conservation, and supply of products necessary in the country include industries essential to health services such as chemical, pharmaceutical, and cleaning products; food industry such as agriculture and agro-industry; financial services including fintech; and logistics. We also continue to encourage investments in priority sectors previously identified in the country, namely agriculture and agro-industry, tourism, oil and gas, infrastructure, energy, and manufacturing.</p><p><strong>CPI recently rebranded as APIEX. What is the rationale behind the transition, and what are the new added competences of APIEX?</strong><br>The Mozambican government created APIEX from the merger of three institutions promoting trade and exports, namely the Investment Promotion Centre (CPI), the Office for Economic Accelerated Development Zones (GAZEDA), and the Export Promotion Institute (IPEX), which were subsequently dissolved. The creation of the new entity is mainly intended to boost the business environment, optimize resources, and create greater synergies in the areas that impact the country's economy.</p><p><strong>In what ways does APIEX seek to boost FDI and exports in Mozambique?<br></strong>APIEX has been devising different strategies to target and attract new investors into the country, support existing ones, and work with other stakeholders (public and private sectors, donors, and so on) to achieve reforms to improve the business environment in the country. As such, we are developing a 10-year Investment and Export Promotion Strategic Plan (PEPIE). We have also been working with different development partners including JICA and the International Trade Centre's (ITC) Partnership for Investment and Growth in Africa (PIGA) to streamline the processes and develop different tools to support investors, such as sector-specific investment promotion strategies to attract FDI into the country. As such, through the PIGA project, a new investment and trade promotion portal was developed to attract more FDI and boost exports from Mozambique, providing all the required information to potential foreign investors and foster exports from Mozambique, and providing international buyers with an export directory and supporting Mozambican SMEs to export. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the best opportunities for economic development in the province where AdZ has its mandate?<br></strong>AdZ is responsible for the rapid development zone in the central region of Mozambique—the Zambezi River Valley. The region accounts for 27% of national GDP and about 25% of Mozambique's national population. This region is a huge area, and its main asset is its natural resources. Rice is one of the main crops we produce for local needs and export. In addition, poultry, livestock, and a wide range of seeds can all be produced in huge quantities in the region. AdZ is working to ensure all these crops are produced and distributed locally and abroad. Zambezi River Valley is also where we have a reputation for producing energy. Plus, we have another five big energy projects. The Zambezi River Valley is the country's best region for energy production. Another of the region's main opportunities is tourism. In terms of natural resources, we also have iron deposits in the province. These are not yet under exploration, but all the preparation work has been done by a UK investor.</p><p><strong>Would you tell us about one or two key projects happening now?<br></strong>AdZ's mandate is to promote the Zambezi River Valley itself and also to assist technically and financially with investment projects here. The main sector we have been engaged in so far is agriculture, where we support local producers to ensure they can enhance their capacity to explore the investment potential that exists here. We are heavily focused on rice production. Our main emphasis is first to make the region self-sufficient and then to supply other regions of the country and perhaps later to export rice. For this, we have been investing heavily in research and improving productivity by providing tractors, harvesting equipment, and supporting the industrial sector with manufacturing equipment to ensure we can also produce processed rice locally. This is one of our big goals in terms of agriculture. The second one is in horticulture. We are supporting local horticultural producers with irrigation schemes, improving seed yields, and aggregating the value of what we produce and supply to our main markets. AdZ's main outreach is smaller farmers to engage them in production and linking them to markets.</p><p><strong>What are AdZ's plans to increase agribusiness, and to what extent is the agency involved in supporting rural energy and financial inclusion in your region?</strong><br>Our approach is always to target the small farmers, as this is how we can promote economic and social inclusion of people in this region. We are engaged with more than 50,000 growers through our programs in different production chains. We provide them with services such as access to mechanization, markets, and technology. We are promoting growth for farmers in their particular areas of production, for example by improving their yields and helping them to get more income out of their crops. We are doing studies into facilitating energy access. In some cases where we cannot provide conventional powerlines, we are providing solar energy. In Tete, we have a flagship irrigation project of more than 1,500ha of production using 100% solar energy. We are busy promoting solar power as an energy source for our small-hold farmers. In terms of access to finance, over the past three or four years we have been able to bring the state-owned National Investment Bank (BNI), which is headquartered in Maputo, to the region. Because we need BNI here, we have supported the bank in establishing a branch and operations in Zambezi River Valley. Today, the local BNI branch is fully operational providing access to finance through our projects in the region. We have also been engaging with the African Development Bank to operate a specific line of credit for rice production. These two development banks are our main intermediaries in terms of providing access to finance for our growers, industries, and traders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the key priorities of the electricity sector?<br></strong>Our biggest priority is to increase the national generation capacity by 600MW within the next five years through a diversity of power stations. 400MW will be generated through the Temane project, a gas-fueled power plant. The remaining 200MW will be produced through seven renewable energy power stations around the country. The Temane project will be operational by 2024, and the renewable power stations should take 10 months to build, with an expected starting date of March 2021. We are also partnering with KFW for the GetFiT renewable project in the fields of solar and hydro energy, as well as with various investors who are supporting us in the process of building power stations such as the Development Bank of Southern Africa (DBSA) and other banks. This 600MW is intended to also develop the nation's industrial matrix, whereby 160MW alone is destined for the Beluluane Industrial Park in Matola. Besides internal consumption, we have received requests for energy supply from neighboring countries such as Zimbabwe and Zambia, whereby a part of output will we exported.</p><p><strong>How has the energy sector in Mozambique evolved over your 20-year career?<br></strong>We have diversified our energy matrix. There was a time where we only had hydroelectric power stations—Cahora Bass and then smaller stations in Manica, Mavuzo, and Chicamba. Now, we have several thermoelectric power stations: Ressano Garcia has two power stations, and there is one in Maputo with a 100-MW capacity. The 400-MW Temane project will add to this. We are also expanding our renewable energy mix such as solar and wind in efforts to avoid overdependence on water as an energy resource. Second, we were able to extend the electricity grid to all of the 154 districts' headquarters. The number of our customers has doubled over the past decade, from 1 million to 2.1 million, representing around 10 million people, assuming an average of five members for each household. The next challenge is to expand the network within each district to reach all communities. And aside from increased generation, we need to also ensure better distribution nationwide, given the production deficit in more remote provinces. All these efforts run in accord with President's Nyusi Energia Para Todos plan, which envisages two main components: the Energy Sector Integrated Program, which relates to energy production, distribution and the necessary investments, and the National Electrification Strategy, geared at maximizing national electrification.</p><p><strong>Will plans to increase internal consumption affect electricity exports?<br></strong>Our strategy is to increase generation sufficiently to enable both meet domestic demand and target external buyers. Mozambique is already one of the few countries in the region producing an energy surplus, whereby the goal is attainable. For example, there are plans to build a power station in Tete that can satisfy local demand as well as exporting to Zambia and Zimbabwe, and there are similar projects for thermal, renewable and coal power stations across the country. Electricity is our third-largest export commodity, and we look forward to continued energy supply to neighboring countries.     </p><p><strong>What are EDM's objectives for 2020? <br></strong>First, we intend to launch two large projects: a 400-kW line that will connect Chiumara to Alto-Molocue, in the Zambezia province, and a transport project to connect Sofala to Inhambane with a 110-kW line. A second goal is to implement procurement-related reforms, for which we have received financial support from Norway. Finally, we intend to connect 300,000 new customers to the grid within the year. The idea is to scale up year after year the number of new customers and achieve the goal of Energia Para Todos by 2030. In terms of performance, our turnover projection for 2020 is over USD600 million compared to less than USD500 million in 2019. On the flipside, a major challenge comes from losses of around 28%, and reducing losses, therefore, is a priority. I want a specific directive to deal with losses and efficiencies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the most important mandate areas of INAMI?<br></strong>INAMI was established in 2014 as a regulatory body with financial autonomy for the mining sector with the passing of a new law concerning mines. INAMI now manages all areas of the sector under the same roof, from exploration to licensing and governance—areas that were previously under the directive of different ministerial bodies. Since the start of activities, our main ongoing concern has been modernizing the mining licensing process through digitalization. By the end of 2019, we introduced the latest update to the system. The end goal is to improve interaction between all interested parties by transforming analog paperwork into a digitalized process. Our next step, to ensure cybersecurity, will be to transfer all data onto a government-controlled cloud. Through our portal, all information regarding licensing has become visible to everyone anywhere in the world, ensuring the maximum level of efficiency. Another priority area of our mandate is geological research through publishing reliable geological information about the country and delivering it to the public. Since 2007, the government has embarked on a concerted effort to thoroughly map the whole country on a 1:250,000 scale; so far, INAMI has executed the airborne geophysical survey of 75% of national territory. INAMI has also mapped in higher detail the mineral-rich provinces of Niassa, Cabo Delgado, Tete, and Manica, on a 1:50,000 scale. In 2015, INAMI started mapping a 950,000-sqkm area between the provinces of Nampula and Zambezia potentially filled with mineral resources. In 2019, we started producing 25 maps of this area at 1:50,000 scale and five maps at 1:250,000 scale. We have already finished 10, and we expect the remaining 15 to be ready by 2021.</p><p><strong>What is Mozambique's record with transparency in the sector?<br></strong>Mozambique is making significant progress in transparency, and our online portal is an example of this process. We are moving toward the goal of being Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)-compliant by the agreed deadline. The biggest remaining challenge concerns deadlines for mining titles and licensing. The process is now fully in place, and companies operating in the field must be informed on ongoing procedures.</p><p><strong>What are the main opportunities in the mining sector?<br></strong>Mozambique is a rich country in terms of mineral resources, with countless opportunities for investment. We have mineral resources for energy production, coal, natural gas, and uranium. Beyond these, there are precious metals, gold, silver, iron, magnesium, chromium, titanium, copper, aluminum, cobalt, nickel, and rare metals such as niobium. In 2016, we granted about 1,400 licenses; today, we have granted 2,000 licenses. Opportunities are growing, and so is the interest of international investors in the field.</p><p><strong>With Vale's operations currently scaled down, do you think the coal industry in Mozambique is eventually destined to phase out?<br></strong>I do not think so, as the prices of mineral resources are highly volatile and reflect shifts in demand. Despite a general decrease of the price of raw materials on the international market in the last couple of years, the demand for coal is still high in countries with high energy demands, such as India. This has happened all the more so through the recent introduction of “clean coal" on the market, a treated type of coal that pollutes less. We might even see an increase in the demand for coal.</p><p><strong>What are INAMI's objectives for 2020?<br></strong>We are working alongside the National Institute of Statistics (INE) to establish a census of small-scale artisanal miners to understand where they are, who they are, and what they do. This is pivotal information we do not possess yet. We will also continue the process of geologically mapping the country; we want to finish five maps made at a 1:250,000 scale by the end of 2020. We will also follow up with companies in order to make sure processes and production starts within the established deadlines. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your strategy behind Sure Global Tech?</h4><p>Sure is a 15-year-old company, and as part of our ambitious plan to expand our business and diversify our revenue, we started a new strategy that consists of several main elements. One is continuing to do what we are good at, which is being a business partner for the government. Our business strategy's central component is to continue with our main pillar, which we have renamed "business solutions" because it falls under the business and technology section. We have also launched a new pillar, investment, and recently invested in and incubated start-ups as part of the Sure strategy to grow the start-up market. There are three main stand-alone companies currently in our portfolio: Haseel, an online platform for groceries; Fandaqah, a platform for hospitality, hotels, and chalets in Saudi linked with AirBnB and other platforms; and Majlestech, a board management system on the cloud that supports government and non-government companies to be more governed and systematic. We regard this as a solution that targets publicly-listed companies and start-ups to ensure the board management tasks and voting are secure and systematic. The third pillar of Sure's strategy is fintech. In 2019, we launched the SurePay initiative focused on fintech. We provide our entire portfolio with payment solutions. We want to expand to target and support the Saudi economy in transitioning toward a cashless society. The fourth pillar is expanding globally, which is why we call ourselves Sure Global Technology. We have opened an office in Egypt, where we have 80 employees. We want to target Egypt and Africa as part of our strategy, as we have the capability and knowledge to support the region toward the move to a digital society. This is part of our know-how that we want to expand and capitalize on from other markets. We have rebranded our strategy to accommodate these four pillars.</p><h4>How are you collaborating on government projects?</h4><p>We have an excellent reputation working with many government agencies. Most of the vital ministries are currently working with us, including finance, tourism, health, defense, commerce, and investment. The Tayseer program is overseen by the Ministry of Commerce. It is part of the National Competitiveness Program to track all reports globally through the World Economic Forum and World Bank to make it easier to do business in Saudi. They wanted an aggregated system that could gather feedback from the private sector, whether local or international, and escalate the relevant issues to the National Competitiveness Program sub-committees. This is a massive project, as everything is now automated with SLAs and dashboards that go to minister-level so they can see every task and the performance of each ministry.</p><h4>How does Sure position itself within the Kingdom's digital transformation process?</h4><p>We understand the importance of digital transformation. With the new leadership standards of the government, there is always demand for new technologies and changing the status quo. It is a big challenge for us internally to ensure we maintain clients' expectations and global technology standards. We always challenge ourselves before going to the clients to determine if moving to a different technology is the right thing to do. We are not partial toward any technology or specific industry; we are only partial to our partners and clients, as we are an end user of that service that the customer is using. We are proud to have within our team subject matter experts in certain technologies, and this makes us unique from the other players in the market as we are staying here and investing for the future.</p><h4>How are you positioning yourself in financial inclusion, and what gap do you hope to bridge?</h4><p>The government is pushing for a cashless society, and when we started our strategy, we looked at the verticals and technologies where we could add value and find synergies between our portfolio and our services as a second focus. One of the areas that we considered investing in was fintech, as we can add a great deal of value. We have developed many solutions for our government partners or clients that sometimes contain payment and online transaction support. We can add value to a cashless society by using technology that we built and have certified from SAMA such that we are now able to sell in the market. The second thing we are growing is the online retail business. We also look at the small and micro businesses that will grow in Saudi. Tourism, events, entertainment, and sports are growing, and all are in need of payment solutions and cashless solutions that can add value. We want to be the partners in adding value to integrating solutions beyond payment acceptance such as integration with their cash registers and online platforms.€¨</p><h4>What other areas will see significant growth soon in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have identified two main areas in which we have not seen major growth in to date but in which there is great potential. These are logistics, where we should develop in terms of technology side since tech companies could add value, and the industrial sector, as we want to look at how Industry 4.0 and technology could also add value to the industry. Many things could be replaced with robotics, data analysis, and linking the logistics chains and suppliers with manufacturers to create local demand and international exports.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nokia is expected to play a major role in the deployment of 5G networks in Europe as you are doing already in the US and Korea. What have been your milestones in Spain in the recent years?</h4><p>Our tagline is that we create the technology to connect the world. With that goal in mind, we have a complete portfolio of solutions for operators and enterprises. A major characteristic of Nokia is our commitment to innovation. Our Nokia Bell labs have come up with extremely relevant innovations for the society as a whole. Today, Nokia is present in every continent and partners with all major Communication Service Providers. The networks that we have deployed around the world support more than 6.4 billion subscriptions. Our enterprise clients have deployed more than 1,300 industrial networks worldwide. We are a global company with EUR23.3 billion in revenues in 2019. In the last two decades, we have invested around EUR130 billion in R&amp;D, EUR4 billion in 2020, which has allowed us to remain at the forefront of the industry. We are going through a transformational process to consolidate four large business groups in the company: cloud and network services; mobile networks; networks infrastructure; and Nokia technologies.</p><h4>How will COVID-19 affect the deployment of 5G in Europe?</h4><p>In its initial stages, the 5G technology will rely on the existing 4G infrastructure, though the 5G concept goes further than previous technological changes. 5G will significantly contribute to the digitalization process for industries and public administrations. Telecommunication operators have been investing steadily to update the infrastructure in the last few years. However, European operators are experiencing challenging circumstances, and it is becoming more common for operators to sign partnerships to share their infrastructure. The current crisis that we are going through due to the pandemic has highlighted how critical telecommunication networks are. 5G deployment plans will not stop; on the contrary, they can become extremely relevant in terms of how we overcome this crisis and emerge stronger from it. The impact that 5G can have on the digitalization of our companies and industries can be significant. 5G technology can help Spain recover from the crisis and become stronger than it was before.</p><h4>Nokia is one of the 5G network providers for Telefónica in Spain; however, Orange and Vodafone are two important Nokia 5G customers outside Spain. Are there plans to be also their supplier in Spain in the next few years?</h4><p>We are willing to have as many customers as possible and we want to be present in most of the market in Spain. We have been working with Telefónica for many years and support them in other areas of the network apart from the radio access. With Vodafone and Orange, we also supply radio access technology in other countries. In Spain we are collaborating with them since many years in the deployment of their Fiber and Transport networks, also critical for 5G. However, so far, we have not been selected  to be one of their suppliers for the radio access network in Spain. Every technology renewal cycle is an opportunity to review that decision. We offer leading technology and competitive commercial conditions.  As a result, at the end of 2020, we had signed 139 5G commercial contracts. And we are always looking at strategies to grow our presence in Spain.</p><h4>The auction of the 700-MHz spectrum has been delayed to 2021 because of COVID-19. What advantage does Nokia have over its two main competitors?</h4><p>We are the only manufacturer of telecommunications infrastructure that has solutions in every area of the network and is present in every continent; our competitors cannot say that. We have experience with all the solutions required to deploy an entire 5G infrastructure. This means we are in the best position to understand the complexity of the network. We understand how all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fits together, and we have a comprehensive understanding of the 5G infrastructure.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the public administration using European funds to help roll out 5G?</h4><p>That is extremely relevant because the recent European recovery funds seek to address two main issues: climate change and the digitalization of the economy. In that regard, we are pleased with the current developments and the commitment to achieving the digitalization goal. These funds are a blessing, and public-private partnership is key to seize these funds. We have to be capable of investing in infrastructure that generates permanent changes in our ecosystem and economy. We are extremely active in seeing how we can participate in that initiative, and are we are in talks with our customers and partners to participate and propose our ideas.</p><h4>Nokia has signed an agreement with NASA to provide 4G technology on the moon. Can you elaborate on that?</h4><p>Nokia is extremely proud of its innovation capacity. We have done many different things over the years. This is an exciting project that seeks to make 4G technology available on the moon taking into account its particularities. This 4G service, which everyone has on their personal cellphones, will be optimized and adapted in an attempt to be compatible with the atmosphere and gravity of the moon. It is an extremely interesting project, and we are proud of the fact that NASA chose to partner with us.</p><h4>What are Nokia Bell Labs working on, and what presence do these labs have in Spain?</h4><p>We are extremely proud of having a division within the Bell Labs based in Spain since more than four years ago. That happened because the company recognized a lot of innovation potential in Spain and many talented people. This site in Spain is heavily focused on developing video-related technologies, one of them being virtual and augmented reality that can be supported by 5G infrastructure. The combination of 5G and video applications have a great potential.</p><h4>What is your main priority for 2021?</h4><p>There are two aspects. First and foremost, the key priority is to ensure employee health and safety in the current uncertain and difficult times derived from the COVID-19. Fortunately, we have not been severely affected by the pandemic. 2021 could likely be the year when we might recover from the pandemic, so in 2021 we must focus on returning to normal. Some of the challenges that the pandemic has brought might be permanent. In terms of business, the main priority will be 5G. Another priority is how we collaborate in the digitalization of our economy and industries, in line with one of Nokia's revised strategy main pillars.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vision 2030 contains specific KPIs around manufacturing, entertainment, quality of life, logistics, as well as digitalization and a streamlining of government processes. How does KAEC fit in with the larger goals of the vision?</h4><p>I am proud and impressed by how the nation has transformed its citizen experience through improving the countries digital ecosystem. Almost every government transaction is now done electronically, and with excellent efficiency. Being a smart city was established as part of KAEC's vision from day one. This means having the right infrastructure, starting with basic telecommunications and fiber to every home, office, and attraction in the city. Then, there is the experience aspect, where we look at every touch point with the customers, whether they are a visitor, resident, or business. A major part of improving their experience is the digital side. We have many applications, solutions, and systems that are transformational. We have also set a target to be the best real estate developer when it comes to the digital experience. One example is that the whole experience of buying one's home is done digitally end-to-end. We are a driver of the vision, and the digitalization of King Abdullah Port's services and of those in the city represent our commitment to its realization. Creating a highly personalized and memorable digital customer experience has always been an integral part of KAEC's DNA, and the global pandemic has only reinforced the important role that technology plays in our lifestyle. As the master developer of an entire City, we have the distinct advantage of owning and curating the entire digital journey for our customers across key sectors; from tourism to the living experience. Therefore, digitalization for us happens in two critical areas; organization and city.</p><h4>KAEC hosted the Saudi Ladies International Golf Tournament as part of the European Tour. How did that event change KAEC, and how did you manage the event under difficult circumstances?</h4><p>The Royal Greens Golf &amp; Country Club is just as important for KAEC as the port. King Abdullah Port is extremely significant, as it establishes KAEC as the place for logistics, industry, and trade. However, KAEC's Royal Greens Golf &amp; Country Club is also transformational because it is now considered one of the top golf courses in the middle east. We created the golf course for the same reason we did the port—KAEC is playing a role in the transformation of Saudi Arabia. One of the areas we identified that was critical for the country and KAEC was sports, and the idea of expanding what sport means in Saudi. We were extremely fortunate to have a partnership with Golf Saudi and the Saudi Golf Federation, in terms of launching international tournaments here, starting from the coveted Saudi International powered by SBIA back in 2019. It has been a blessing hosting the men's tournaments twice, and in 2020 we have added another level with the first ever women's international golf tournaments in the Kingdom— Aramco Saudi Ladies International presented by PIF. That makes a big statement, both internationally and locally. The country is actively trying to show the world the real face of Saudi. Considering that and the media coverage the events have received, it has been extremely successful.</p><h4>A Formula One race will be held on a street circuit in downtown Jeddah in 2021. Does KAEC have plans to capture some of the tourism inflow from that event or engage with motorsport more broadly?</h4><p>F1 coming to Saudi, showcases the countries ambitions to become an active player and contributor to sports in general and motor racing in specific. We will target tourists from the F1 race, and we also have a racetrack in KAEC. We have just finished the track and will announce it soon as we are working with the Saudi Motor Sports Federation, the Public Investment Fund, and others to bring it to life allowing it to host other formats of car racing's events such as endurance racing, 24-hour races and other GT-related races. In the meantime, we will be actively capturing the tourism and hospitality traffic that will come to the event in Jeddah.</p><h4>King Abdullah Port saw a three-fold increase in cargo volumes from 2018 to 2019 despite lower international trade overall. What are your future plans for the port, and how do you see it evolving within KAEC's wider strategic plan?</h4><p>Sport events are certainly part of a key pillar for KAEC, and we like to label it a “quality leisure experience on the Red Sea." That is how we define our pillar and mission there. KAEC's second pillar is related to our unique living experience. We are not just building homes but creating a whole living ecosystem. Third, we offer a location for businesses to succeed, whereby we enable small businesses, entrepreneurship, and the service sector to grow in Saudi Arabia. The fourth pillar is what we call our global logistics and light manufacturing hub based on our location, both as a country and as a project on the Red Sea. There was and still is a gap in terms of the logistics infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. Again, KAEC wants to play a role given our location. King Abdullah Port is not just the basic physical infrastructure; there are many components that define a successful port. We have built a port that can accommodate the largest vessels in the world, including the required water depth and cranes. There is also an entire ecosystem in terms of regulations, how the port is operated, how goods are cleared, and so on. There has been great focus on ensuring the port is best in class on the engineering side as well as the operations side. Equally important is the logistics area around the port—that is where you complete the whole offering. It is the most efficient and fastest port in the country, and that is why it has seen such success.</p><h4>How does having a Haramain high-speed rail stop in KAEC change the city and accessibility?</h4><p>For any city to be successful, and especially a city promising a unique living experience, a global logistics hub, and more, it requires connectivity. Being by the sea, we have the port for cargo. As a large country, we need to be well-connected to the road network, and rail has been a major focus for Saudi Arabia, both for cargo and passengers. In addition, KAEC is fortunate to be linked by the Haramain high-speed rail. This is the first high-speed service connecting these three cities: Medina; KAEC; and Mecca, which together represent the highest population in the Gulf region. KAEC is in the middle, and having the Haramain high-speed rail also gives us immediate access to the airport in 30 minutes. In 2021 and beyond, the high-speed train will definitely play a major role in bringing more traffic into the city, both for tourism and business.</p><h4>With a multi-decade development plan like KAEC, there must come a tipping point where there is enough development and activity for the whole venture to thrive. What evidence of that tipping point might we see in the near term at KAEC?</h4><p>The two areas that are clearly witnessing a tipping point now are tourism and logistics. Tourism has been driven by the change in dynamics caused by COVID-19 and the government focusing on tourism. We are fortunate to be in the right place at KAEC, and we already have the assets and the experience. KAEC aims to become one of the most attractive tourism destinations on the Red Sea in line with the Kingdom's Vision 2030. As part of its endeavors aimed at meeting the growing demand for tourism and entertainment destinations in the Kingdom, KAEC pays attention to working on three tracks: Tourism and Entertainment Projects Targeting Saudi Families, World Sports, as well as Activities &amp; Events (Social, cultural, sports, and art) events that suit all segments of society according to their different ages and interests. We are therefore able to capture local tourism quickly. Having the train connectivity will also contribute to the experience of coming to KAEC. The recognition of KAEC as a leisure destination is visible this year, and that is one example of the tipping point. In terms of logistics, the port continues to grow, even witnessing solid growth during COVID-19, especially healthcare-related inbound cargo, also playing a role in the wider supply chain. That growth shows we are finally seeing the tipping point related to logistics. KAEC has some of the largest logistics facilities in the Middle East. These are not just warehouses; they are advanced logistics facilities using state-of-the-art robotics and other technology. On top of that, we have light manufacturing. KAEC is considered the biggest hub for pharmaceutical companies in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf. The likes of Sanofi and Pfizer have their factories here. It also helps us being close to King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST), which places heavy focus on research, so that whole ecosystem will also see a transformation now. With these two pillars of tourism and logistics, we will see a flow of more and more people coming to live in KAEC and experience the lifestyle we can offer them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does resilience mean to Alef Education, and what helped the organization remain resilient in the last few months?</h4><p>Resiliency to me is defined by how one copes with unplanned events. Being in a digital education space meant we were able to ensure that learning continued for students, schools were supported with technology, and we as an organization would be able to shift to working from home and give people the right tools to be resilient as an organization to fulfill our obligations to our customers and ministries. Typically, a large part of our work here is done with government entities. It was a real test for Alef Education, though given that we have a hybrid model in place, where people had the flexibility to work remotely, we saw productivity increasing at the initial onset. Resiliency was more about how to sustain that.</p><h4>How did Alef's use of e-learning and technology position it during the pandemic, and where are you right now?</h4><p>We saw little to no disruption to students being able to learn from home. In addition, our teachers who were using our program were also able to measure progress with a real-time assessment and feedback engine to make sure they mitigated any learning loss that students would face. We responded by also offering our products and services for free. We coined our learning for all initiative, which is our part to help schools and other institutions that needed access to digital tools to help their learners. This initiative was also recognized by UNESCO, which shared the initiatives of various countries and what they were doing to help schools cope.</p><h4>How did you transform your technologies internally?</h4><p>Alef Education's core learning platform “The Alef Platform“ was predominantly for middle to high school, namely grades 5 to 12. We recently launched a K to 4 Arabic learning product called Abjadiyat mostly for Arabic learners. In January 2021, we will launch a new B2C innovative Arabic learning application that will serve learners at all levels. This period has made us look at some of the other areas in the market that we can innovate our products and services to offer them and grow our business. We will try to expand on those things; for example, virtual tutoring can be a complementary service for perhaps math or science instruction.</p><h4>Where do you see yourself contributing to the transformation of education today and tomorrow?</h4><p>Recently, we announced a partnership with the Ministry of Education to roll out the Alef Platform to more than 200 schools across the Northern Emirates. This was a real turning point for us in terms of our partnerships, growth, stabilizing the actual platform, and offering to nationalize education with the digital strategy for the education sector in the UAE. We have also seen continued growth in our charter school market in the US. In December, we signed a landmark deal with the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs that will see more than half a million students using our program for math instruction. These are some of the things that really push the boundaries, and we have been able to experience significant growth during this period.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the process of reopening the schools and your opinion of the government's response?</h4><p>The UAE government's response has been world class. It has enabled both private and public sector schools to access the tools with digital tools, connectivity, and in some cases devices to help schools that were impacted by all these closures. The UAE has been a case study for the rest of the world in how it handled the pandemic for learners in this country. From a school opening perspective, preparing some of the schools, including the Northern Emirates expansion, means we have had to equip schools with the right tools and so on. We ensure the right infrastructure is there and that we are following the protocols, such as making sure that when classes go back in January, students who do elect to go back are given an option to learn with minimal disruption.</p><h4>How has your experience been regarding collaboration with public-sector authorities?</h4><p>We work with the ministry and the likes of ADEK and have various committees that meet on a regular basis with the relevant authorities to explore the lessons learned. We also talk about other public sectors and recently signed a partnership with Arabic Learning Center in Abu Dhabi, which is part of the Ministry of Tourism and Culture. This partnership was more broadly to discuss ways to innovate Arabic-language in both the UAE and other Arabic-speaking countries.</p><h4>How do you incorporate AI into your education technologies?</h4><p>AI will drive a new way of learning understanding the unique learning styles of each student to determine areas of interest and find alternative ways for students to reach levels of mastery that were not possible before. We are trying to augment the learning experience to understand where students are struggling and how to fill those gaps. AI can help teachers assess students by streamlining the grading process through the added benefit of providing deeper and real-time insights for teachers. They can then understand strengths and weaknesses and really focus on more targeted intervention and class interaction with students. This could be every month or every term. As AI evolves, I see a future where machines along with human intervention will help ensure students drive the right future secondary and career choices based on their skills and abilities. There is a great deal of work to be done, but this will be transformative in many industries, especially education.</p><h4>How will this tie into creating a more diversified knowledge-based economy?</h4><p>There are many ways to connect education with the needs of a diversified knowledge-based economy. Building a knowledge-based economy will rely on innovation and the education sector. Therefore, there needs to be greater emphasis on educating the youth on their future career choices and bridging the gap between K to 12 and higher education and ensure learners and their learner profile drives their future career choices. This is extremely relevant to the times that we live in today, and Alef Education is constantly working with local ministries to explore affirmative ways to build and foster a culture of creativity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give an overview of your activities, and how is CERT addressing the challenges of today?</h4><p>Like many organizations navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, we at CERT are cautiously working on our plans to ensure business continuity and transition to the new normal. The pandemic has taken the world by surprise and is shaping a new paradigm of the world economy. This hybrid paradigm has its merits and challenges. In pursuit of these insights, CERT is hosting a webinar series with thought leaders, policymakers, experts, and consultants to understand the evolving best practices and strategies for a resilient recovery. According to research, more than 80% of companies have planned or are planning to embed new ways of working, evidencing that the operation model for many educational institutions, will change. The study revealed that while one of the top priorities for organizations was to secure funds to meet their financial obligations, 40% of these organizations had not planned for their recovery. Further, a common unfinished priority was the review of the post-COVID-19 implications for their business models. In the learning &amp; development industry, COVID-19 has been a significant paradigm shifter. The future of learning has become the present and we are all bound to adapt to a faster, more agile world in terms of ways of working, communicating, and delivering education solutions to our clients. Investments within the education technology (Ed tech) industry globally has risen to over USD10 billion as an indicative of how the application of digital solutions is central to the transition to new learning paradigms. Let us take, for instance, corporate and executive programs at international business schools, where the prospect of professional networking is a driver of enrollment. In an online learning model, this key feature becomes more challenging to accomplish, requiring a careful redesign of the learning experience. Interestingly, there is a perception that online learning cannot fully replicate the conventional environment and therefore some argue that institutions should reduce their tuition fees. Although CERT is a different in size in comparison to the  global business schools, but we have embraced the paradigm shift, rethinking our model and transitioning to online platforms. We successfully launched the Menasati Online Platform, the first of its kind in the region for technical and professional workforce education. Menasati has been accepted well by our clients and partners, ensuring the continuity of impactful programs with Etihad Airways, ADNOC, and ENOC, to name a few. The Menasati initiative was in the works before the COVID-19 outbreak, and in some way this unprecedented situation urged for a faster roll-out of this learning solution. Menasati is a unique, multi-entity platform that goes beyond the typical learning management system (LMS) to include an integrated student information system (Menasati SIS) and a knowledge-sharing, coaching environment. When CERT transitioned to an online learning model, we made the conscious decision to remain loyal to our philosophy of continued learning to ensure that we provide the same personalized mentorship and guidance via our virtual classrooms as if the learners were on site. Learners have access to both bespoke and standardized content which is delivered by our expert faculty in virtual classrooms in synchronous or asynchronous manner. Through the Menasati platform CERT not only delivers corporate training, but also reaches out to the community through the Menasati CSR initiative, which offers a portfolio of 50 short courses free to the public. The Menasati CSR courses include self-development and professional development topics, aimed at increasing the readiness of educational institutions for the online environment. Our most popular courses are those related to counseling, self-management, and student support, which universities and schools can integrate into their curriculum, to help their learners make the transition to online classrooms successfully.</p><h4>What is your method for curriculum and course selection, and has there been any change since the pandemic?</h4><p>In the midst of the pandemic the first reaction of the entire market was to see what was happening with the evolution of COVID-19, before enrolling their employees in training programs.  Thanks to the excellent relationships that we have built with our partner organizations, the enrolment commitments scheduled before the pandemic came through. CERT's ability to offer a wide selection of courses, in English and Arabic, as bespoke, customized, or standardized content, is a distinctive competency in the Training &amp; Development industry, which is leveraging our resiliency.  Our catalog comprises from technical qualifications such as Process Control, Aviation Engineering to Accounting, Finance, Leadership, Taxation, Employability and the emerging fields of Data science, Blockchain and AI.  Our expert curriculum development teams, trainers, assessors and internal verifiers design, localize and customize course materials and programs to global standards, while keeping the bespoke nature of the content, specific to the organization, the sector and the group of learners. Since the pandemic, CERT's shift to online delivery required an orchestration of technology infrastructure, people, and processes. We launched a number of innovations in our Menasati platform, while remaining true to our roots of active learning.  From pre-training assessments and competency mapping to delivery and quality assurance, we phased-in our transition to an online model. A pillar for success was our in-house capabilities:  we counted on the expertise of our faculty team and curriculum developers with prior online instructional design and teaching experience to kick start the process. We deployed train-the-trainer sessions to bring all our faculty into a standardized approach. Our mentors and call centers communicated constantly with both students and their employers to address their technical questions. Our program management teams worked 24/7, constantly monitoring and evaluating our large scale programs, ensuring the deployment of course content and the agile scheduling of hundreds of classes across multiple sections in several emirates at a time. All our programs maintained their pre-training and post-training assessments, which were conducted online. We adapted content of traditional 4-hour on-site sessions into bite size segments, delivered online via five-minute videos, or via browser modules in synchronous or asynchronous manner. We made tutoring hours a priority, to ensure that learners could connect with their instructor at defined times in the day and have live virtual sessions for feedback. We infused our programs with guided projects, class activities, learner portfolios and assessments to measure performance of the learners, attainment of standards and specific organizational learning goals. The component of assessments (formative and summative) in all our programs is a key differentiator that our client organizations value highly.</p><h4>In which areas do you see an increased and renewed demand for employment and skills?</h4><p>COVID-19 has accelerated digital transformation across sectors and forced us to rethink how we prepare the workforce of the future to thrive in the new reality.  In terms of employability the priorities will change as our world is changing, and the need for certain disciplines will be more pronounced than others. Studies about the labor market indicate that jobs in the medical, engineering, finance and IT were the least negatively impacted during the pandemic and a turnaround in hiring is expected starting the 2nd half of the year. It is quite certain that technology will continue to be a driving force to reckon with and that the future of work is now. The post-COVID workplace is more digitalized, flexible, with efficient remote work arrangements, strong employer branding, emphasis in the integration of life and work, and increased expectations of performance.  Retaining or attracting a skilled digital workforce and creating truly productive digital workplaces should be on the top of the agenda of organizations. We are constantly taking the pulse of the market and aligning our strategies to national initiatives to spearhead capacity building. We cooperate with regulators and government bodies to ensure that our reskilling programs provide the tools needed by job seekers and new hires to gain resiliency in the new reality. As a Licensed Training Provider with ACTVET and a Registered Training Provider for the National Qualifications Authority (NQA) and for Foreign Awarding Bodies and Professional Organizations, we align our programs to the occupational and functional needs of the UAE.  We continue to administer IELTS, OET and psychometric tests and technical tests in our Assessment centers across the nation, supporting organizations in their human capital decisions.</p><h4>How are the public and private sectors performing, and what are the challenges or opportunities?</h4><p>CERT's ties with industry are stronger than ever, and in an era of uncertainty, industry leaders are looking for reliable providers of services; budding entities with commonality of missions and a proven record of impact on performance. Our clients are leading organizations in the public and private sector with a priority for investment in human capital development. We are truly grateful for the positive response of the market, which continues to entrust us with their talent development and corporate training projects to assess, skill, re-skill and upskill their workforce. Our industry engagements continue to be as active as they were before the outbreak. Many industry partners seek advice and exchange ideas with our senior management team, especially when it comes to human capital management. The pre-COVID and post-COVID markets could not be more different. Organizations ought to use this time to build in-house capabilities, and invest in professional development of their employees so that when the market bounces back, they will be ready to maintain their competitive advantage. We are witnessing a growing number of requests from organizations looking to enhance their employer branding, to attract top talent and retain valuable employees. Through our data analytics services, we are able to provide insights into their recruitment process, removing all the logistical constraints of interviewing face-to-face, onboarding new talent, or training them for their effective transition to a remote workplace. COVID-19 forced us to adapt quickly with the resources at hand. Yet, looking at the long term, we can be more strategic in the planning of our organizational needs and the set-up of effective systems to track organizational performance. Most organizations request programs to prepare their H.R. and operations management teams to effectively implement and manage remote work environments in the long-run. Resilient organizations focus on strengthening the soft skills and leadership competencies of their teams, maximizing their ability to create, innovate, and thrive. For all those activities and services, our senior management and business development teams are in constant communication with the industry. Thanks to the trust that we garnered from our partners and clients, we can successfully navigate this crisis together. CERT is an agile, dynamic organization that can react quicker than the larger companies. While there will be uncertainties, we will surely deal with them through the strength of our organizational culture and our values, looking at the future through a lens of optimism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Engie in Morocco, has become a market leader in electricity production and energy services. How would you describe the evolution of the company over these years?</h4><p>ENGIE's ambition in Morocco has been to contribute to the country's objective of a wide affordable and sustainable energy access. With more than 1,600 employees in the country, we are present in Morocco in power production with 1,700MW of installed capacity with the Tarfaya wind farm (301MW) and the Safi thermal plant (1,386MW), and in the field of energy services. HVAC and fluid engineering, electrical and electromechanical engineering, electrical and telecom infrastructures, multi-technical maintenance, and energy efficiency: We service more than 200 customers on a daily basis.</p><h4>2020 has been a challenging year for all industries in Morocco. How has COVID-19 impacted your operations and what are the key strategies you have followed to mitigate this impact? </h4><p>In 2020, in the context of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, our teams remained constantly mobilized to ensure a continuity of service on our customers' premises.  We implemented Business Continuity Plans very early on, which enabled us to protect our employees while standing by our client to help them resume their activities. These plans have been considered as an industry standard. In spite of this economic downturn, we continued to develop innovative solutions for a low carbon future. For instance, Nexans Morocco and ENGIE signed a 15-year contract for the design, construction, servicing and maintenance of a rooftop photovoltaic plant with an installed capacity of 2.5MW, covering nearly 22% of the plant's annual electricity needs and avoiding the emission of more than 700 tons of CO2 per year. We also installed this year the first photovoltaic solar power plant for irrigation pumping for the agricultural sector in Morocco.</p><h4>In terms of exports, what are your expansion plans? </h4><p>Let's take two examples of the expertise that we export outside of Morocco. The first one is with Groupement Orange Services (GOS), which is a subsidiary of ORANGE in Cí´te d'Ivoire, which manages Orange's network infrastructures. ENGIE Services Maroc supported the local subsidiary of ENGIE (ENGIE Services Cí´te d'Ivoire) in the award of the multi-technical maintenance contract for the latest-generation datacenter that GOS opened in Abidjan in 2017. ENGIE's experience in Morocco in the field of operating and maintaining datacenter, with INWI in the telecom sector, with BMCE Bank in the banking sector, and with DXC Technology, was key to the successful award of the contract to ENGIE. Another example is the construction of three ground-mounted photovoltaic power plants coupled with power generators to supply three villages in Gabon with our client AUSAR ENERGY, a joint venture by ENGIE Africa, ENGIE Ineo Scle and Centum Adetel. Our teams in Morocco managed the project from the design to the commissioning of the three photovoltaic power plants.</p><h4>What are your key goals and priorities for the year ahead and for 2021?</h4><p>For ENGIE, the crisis has taught us a lot about our ability to adapt and to develop new ways of working. We have also shown our agility in the transformation of our activities to adapt to the current and future needs of our customers. This led to creating new development opportunities for the company in the context of this economic crisis. In Morocco, like in many countries impacted by COVID-19, adapting the economy and the industrial capabilities to reduce the dependency on imports in key sectors (health, manufactured goods... etc.), appeared critical in reducing the impact of the crisis. More generally, this objective to rethink the supply sources, as close as possible to the needs could be very beneficial to Morocco because of its proximity to Europe but also the essential role it plays as an economic driver in Africa. Finally, concerning the energy sector, there is a good chance that the energy world of tomorrow will be much more oriented towards a more sustainable and a greener energy supply. A world where renewable energy will be the norm. An area where, here again, Morocco is leapfrogging competition… Here too, we are ready to support all economic actors in Morocco in their neutral-carbon strategy to a greener economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you hope to achieve in Mexico?</h4><p>Our vision and mission is to help transform cities into smarter, friendlier, and more habitable places. In terms of the scope and definition of smart cities, which is popular around the world right now, we participate in several of the key elements that help a smart city evolve. One of them is communication, namely media communication. We began as an out-of-home traditional company with billboards, and now we are fully digital. Some 95% of our business in Mexico is comprised of digital billboards and digital street furniture. That gives companies greater flexibility in communicating their messages and in fact works via a cellular phone today. If one wants to post a message, advertisement, or even a social emergency communication from a local government, we can upload that onto our screens within hours. We are contributing to communication, and as we head toward greater digitalization of this communication, it becomes more flexible, user friendly, and relevant in terms of the geographic location, time of day, or time of year. One can develop a concept on digital media and digital content marketing, whether it on cellular phones or laptops, and that is what we would call a contextual market. That is an incredible advance in the way one communicates, markets, and send messages to the citizens of the city. The second one is what we promote openness and flexibility in helping cities with their street furniture such as bus shelters. In other cities around the world, we provide public intelligent bathrooms and intelligent waste deposits. The third factor, which is perhaps the most relevant for Mexico City, is that we own and operate ECOBICI, the public bike sharing system. Clear Channel was a pioneer, and we started the project not as a business but a service that we provide. We asked the city to let us operate the bicycle system in exchange for additional street furniture and out-of-home advertising. We also work with cities to share, analyze, and understand big data and mobility data. We work with leading providers of mobility data. For example, in Mexico we work with a company called sintrafico.com, which provides mobility information to the government. During President Lopez's daily speeches during the pandemic, when the government talked about mobility and how many people are out on the streets, it was given to them by Sin Tráfico. It has a massive sample of more than 20 million cellphones to understand how things move. Big data is a major player in what we do in cities. In addition to cities, we also work with private enterprise, shopping malls, stadiums, airports, and bus stations, where we can also provide advertising. Our vision is to go 100% digital; we are no longer into classical or traditional areas. Digital is not only the future but the present, as almost 100% of our business is now digital. Mexico City for us is 100% digital. We only sell digital out-of-home, and that provides us with great flexibility.</p><h4>Is there an opportunity for billboards because people are oversaturated by online advertising?</h4><p>It is not cannibalization; it is a complement, as they work well together. About a year and a half ago, Facebook did a study that found social media and out-of-home work extremely well. We have run interactive campaigns and time-related campaigns that have been extremely relevant, with a hashtag and real-time news. For example, during the World Cup a few years ago, we were showing the real-time scores on our digital billboards. At the end of the day, we aim to have the same flexibility that a cellphone has with the advantage of cellphones. Now, with ad blocking apps, the number of people who block ads is extremely high, and this motivates us to work with advertisers, marketing teams, and creatives to develop truly impactful, relevant, and attractive messages to the consumer. We have more than 500 advertisers. Going digital gives us the ability to show around eight to 10 advertisers at the same time in one hour.</p><h4>What will be your main priorities for the coming year?</h4><p>Growth and growth. It is extremely important, because the pandemic has hit us. However, the underlying issue is the economic slowdown globally, and that will hit us hard. We are all panicking about the health portion of the pandemic, but it has created one of the worst economic crises in history. For Mexico, it has been the worst decline in economic growth in almost 90 years since 1932. We need to reinvent the way we sell and merchandise ourselves. There is a logical opportunity to either merge or acquire smaller players. Such crises give companies the opportunity to quickly consolidate, and that is what we need to utilize. For example, right now we have been selectively acquiring digital billboards and digital locations in Mexico City and other cities during the pandemic. We focus on the top-10 cities of the country.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about the products and services you offer in Mexico?</h4><p>We are developing, for example, a new version of ECOBICI, a state-of-the-art bicycle that is hybrid and will replace electric bicycles. We are truly bringing the bicycle system into the 21st century, and it applies to not only the bicycles and cycle stations, but also the software and technology with which it runs. In street furniture, we are working with designers in Europe and China to start developing street furniture and even upgrade the quality of digital screens in line with the best in the world, such as Times Square. Times Square is the gold standard of screens and is the quality of digital out-of-home that we aim to have in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the biggest changes to your business model that you have implemented to Teleperformance in Mexico?</h4><p>We are a public company and entered the CAC 40 at the beginning of 2020. We reached EUR12 billion in market cap, which allowed us to get into the elite group CAC 40. Today, we are positioned at approximately EUR16 billion of market cap with 330,000 employees around the world. We have been offering our services in the market for the past forty years. We offer digital integrated business services, with a One Office model that combines three main offers. The first is front office, and this is a service we provide through 400 contact centers handling and managing interactions with the end users of our corporate clients, which are usually Fortune 500 companies. We provide an omni-channel environment with services such as sales, retention, tech support, and customer service. The second offer is back office, where we analyze and seek opportunities to improve and reduce costs for our clients while leveraging our knowledge in front office. Both for the front-office and for the back-office, we have invested in a team of experts in Technology, Analytics, and Process, providing additional value to our clients using tools such as RPAs, RDAs, chatbots, voice-to-text translators, among many others. We service three markets from Mexico: Mexico, LATAM, and the US. In these markets, some of the verticals were hit heavily due to COVID-19. Tourism is a perfect example, as we have hotel chains and airlines as partners, that have seen a significant impact. We have also seen some other verticals that have been impacted on the positive side. Companies like food delivery and e-retail have grown dramatically. We have seen an upset in our market, with slight impact to our business demand. Some of our competitors failed to migrate their business to a work-from-home environment. This created huge demand for such services, that we capitalized significantly. With this, we expect to close 2020 with double-digit growth in revenue while our bottom line will remain flat. While COVID-19 impacted our profitability, we did not see a drop last year. This is a great story to tell from a financial perspective.</p><h4>What do you forecast when it comes to revenue and growth for 2020 compared to 2019?</h4><p>Despite COVID-19, we expect to close 2020 with revenue growth of over 10%. The pandemic did have an impact on our business but there were enough positive elements, to upset those that impacted negatively. At the end our growth versus 2019 was strong, and it allowed us to meet our targets for the year, both on revenue and profitability.</p><h4>What main added value does Teleperformance offer in Mexico compared to other players in the market?</h4><p>We are a company that is extremely solid from a financial perspective. We are big, we are growing, we are profitable, and we are extremely innovative. We are seeking change; we are extremely dynamic and agile when talking about change and seeking opportunities. This jump from the front office to the middle and back office is one step, and our efforts in the Work-at-Home environment have also been fantastic. We migrated 18,000 jobs from Contact Centers to a Work-at-Home environment in five weeks, seeking to protect the health of our employees, maintain and protect job security, and ensure business continuity for our clients. We are also offering the market: security, dynamism, and agility to protect the businesses of our clients. Today, we are building what we call Cloud Campus Hubs. In Mexico, we are leading the way with the number of Hubs that are being implemented within the Teleperformance world. These are small areas like Contact Centers, though these are specific for coaches, trainers, and middle to high-management leaders of the operation where they can meet, share ideas, and capitalize high-tech tools and equipment in these Hubs to manage people working from home. For example, from one of our hubs in Guadalajara, we manage over 800 people working from home.</p><h4>What are your main priorities in 2021 to achieve this 25% growth?</h4><p>Cloud Campus is our main priority. We were offering Cloud Campus since before COVID-19. Our partners were hesitant to move in that direction but had to in the end, and it opened up a window of opportunities for us. Now, our mindset is we cannot operate work from home as if it is a contingency; we have to make this shine in every way with the use of technology, engagement, and processes and thrive in the delivery of the business. We need to prove to our clients now that we can operate better from home than from the Contact Center. The only way to do that is to invest in training, people, and processes as well as technology and innovation. We innovated what we call TP Sentinel in Mexico. It is being deployed worldwide in TP and is a tool that allows us to monitor how our employees are connected from home. We can see what carrier they are using, if they are connected through a wireless network or by cable, we can measure their bandwidth and determine if that works for the program they work for. All these create a great diagnosis to truly understand how we stand from a technology and infrastructure perspective. We will push the carriers so we can have a better network and bandwidth throughout. There are many more things that TP Sentinel can do, but it is a huge innovation. The service was born three months ago and today is in full global deployment, so we are truly pleased and proud about that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify to launch your first Debt Issuance in 2020?</h4><p>Hospitales Mac was established in Celaya 12 years ago, and we have grown at an annual compound growth rate (CAGR) of 25%. It is difficult to maintain these rates if you do not arm yourself with financing that is ever more attractive and competitive. The company prepared itself for this Debt Issuance for around a year. We prepared our financials to meet IFRS standards and implemented changes of Corporate Governance best practices and transparency for minority ownership. Once we were ready, we chose the BIVA stock exchange through Actinver as our underwriter. We issued our instrument on September 25, 2020. We were able to refinance our most expensive debt in order reduce our interest expenses and free cash flow to new projects in Léon, Los Mochis, and Aguascalientes. We have a program called 15/15 that aims to build 15 hospitals in the following 15 years after we were established. We are the youngest hospital chain in the country and the one with the largest potential growth and achieved.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourself from the current public market companies in your sector?</h4><p>As opposed to the other Healthcare Operator in the market, we have eight units throughout the country; whereas they are concentrated in a single hospital campus which consequently gives them a high-risk concentration, geographically and strategically. We have eight hospitals in operation and three more that will blossom soon. We are the fourth largest hospital chain in the country by number of hospitals and operate in six states. This is why we believe we are less of a market risk for investors.</p><h4>What has been the company's price strategy?</h4><p>Even though our Hospital Units are not large, they do not lack anything. The corridors are broad because we have not exaggerated the waiting areas. We have solar panels and are seeking efficiencies, not only in construction, but also in our operation. The culture of our organization has three pillars. <br></p><ul><li>Treat the patient fairly, kindly and with respect.</li></ul><ul><li>Outwork the competition.</li></ul><ul><li>Do more with less. </li></ul><p>If we achieve more than our competition by generating savings, we can pass on those savings to patients. The most expensive cost for any hospital is an empty room. Our hospitals have no more than 50 beds, and we attempt to have them at 80% capacity throughout the month. Our competition does has more rooms than us but their occupancy is lower which generates excess costs of operation. All of this enables us to reduce our price to the public in a way most of our competition cannot.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion in other regions in the country?</h4><p>In the north, we only have one hospital in Mexicali. We are mostly concentrated in the center of Mexico, including the Bají­o region. We have hospitals in Celaya,  San Miguel de Allende, Irapuato, Guadalajara, Aguascalientes, and Léon. We also have a hospital in Puebla that we opened two years ago, and it is one of the most successful hospitals for the brand. seven of our existing 8 hospitals are ours. And we are building three more, two of them are ours. We did not want to enter Mexico City until we understood how to operate in a large city like Puebla. Once we understood Puebla and generated the results we needed to expand, we acquired a hospital in Mexico City, in Periferico Sur. This is the only operation in which we do not own the Real Estate in which operate. We like to focus on secondary cities that require hospital infrastructure and where we have the capability to build our hospital from scratch. Most of these secondary cities in our country have outdated or no hospitals at all, we aim to change that with modern more equipped hospitals for these regions. Once we have expanded our Mexican operation to a size we feel comfortable with, we will like look south of our borders to continue expanding in a market that is much like our own.</p><h4>How has the pandemic impacted your business?</h4><p>We had time to prepare our hospitals for the COVID-19 crisis; it took three months for the pandemic to reach Mexico since it originated. Which is why we had the time to dedicate an entire floor for COVID-19 patients and keep the other floors for non-Covid patients. We also implemented a strategy to ensure our hospital staff were rightly protected and secure. We acquired ventilators, in addition to those we had, in order to tend to the incoming Covid patients. We also acquired some extra inventory in medicines and materials to protect our professionals. We employ almost 2,000 people, and none of them have been infected inside our hospitals. Those whom have gotten infected were infected at their homes.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the rest of the year?</h4><p>In late 2020, we will present the information of the last quarter with the clarity required according to the best corporate practices. We want to launch a capital IPO in 2022, and this issuance of certificates is our entry into the public markets. We are already in the top division because we were able to enter the market, but we have to continue training to win the championship. We must consolidate our company in order to achieve continued and prolonged growth rates. We raised MXN500 million in our first issuance, and we were authorized a program to raise a total of MXN1.5 billion. We expect to issue the remainder during 2021. <br>We also have a foundation that, among other activities, tends to Down's syndrome children. Many of them have heart malfunctions, so we are committed to performing surgery for many of them. We try to perform 15 such surgeries a year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the difference between Comex and Comex Professional Division?</h4><p>We serve many markets and customers. Through the 4,700 Comex stores, we serve mainly the DIY sector, individuals, carpenters, and locksmiths. In Comex, one can find an entire portfolio of coatings, including waterproofing, wood coating, and industrial products. In the Professional Division, we visit our customers with over 1,000 sales reps in the country who work with our concessioners. We work with sectors during the customers' entire journey, from specification and operation of the projects to after the application, and everything between these steps. We work with B2B commercial in five main sectors: on new construction for housing and corporate, government, and the entire commercial and hospitality sectors. In B2B industrial, we have basic infrastructure in Mexico, which is oil and gas, energy, communications, and everything related to private and government companies generating all the resources within the country. Another one, is the entire manufacturing sector for every category in the country as well as the steel manufacturing sector. We are one of the most recognized brands in the country since we are the third-largest retail chain. We remain committed to the community and have donated to the health sector more than 1.5 million masks and thousands of liters of sanitizing and antibacterial gel that we manufacture in our facilities produced in line with WHO recommendations. This is not a one-part job, as government, private companies, and individuals all need to play a part to recover quickly and get through this difficult situation.</p><h4>What new opportunities have emerged in 2020?</h4><p>We foresee heavy investment in automotive, aerospace, electronics, textiles, health, rail, appliances, marine, transportation, energy, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and many other sectors due to COVID-19. This represents a significant opportunity for asset protection in both construction and maintenance for the investment already in place in the country. Application services are one of the main opportunities we can provide to the Mexican market. Another important opportunity in the Mexican market is working in different product attributes that help the construction industry and make their jobs easier. We are creating environmentally friendly solutions that are water based, have low VOC content, and are lead free, insulation systems to reduce energy consumption, and water and fireproof coatings that meet LEED certification to reduce one's carbon footprint. This is a growing trend in construction and industry that we need to meet, as it will become increasingly relevant in the coming years. Another opportunity for us is the rapid and significant growth of ecommerce. An omnichannel experience will be necessary for many companies, including ourselves, and we need to adapt and create integral solutions based on customers' needs, with immediate and technical and commercial information in real time with payment methods and direct onsite delivery. We have more than 660 concessions that own more than 4,700 stores in the country, and we have more than 25,000 people working in these stores. The main challenge is to provide a safe environment for our employees and customers because we are an essential sector and remain open. This has truly been priority number one. More than 50% of the entire population is working from home. We are adapting our digital communications and platforms and learning to keep people motivated and focused. The second priority because we are an essential sector, is continuing with our operations. We need to adjust our manufacturing cycles, keep our stores open, and deliver millions of liters nationwide while having sector restrictions and non-operation activity from some suppliers, including raw materials and many others. Our finance, manufacturing, and operations team have become nimble, much more agile, more resourceful, and extremely creative. Demand for our products has only been growing; we have been growing more than 11% during this pandemic because people are investing in their homes.</p><h4>What is your strategy to ensure the professional division grows in the coming months?</h4><p>Most of the strategy is to remain close to our customers, not only physically but also in the digital aspect, as we need to accelerate our omni-channel experience. We are currently working on an app where our professional customers will be able to find out our portfolio of solutions and services from their phones. The second priority is to be with them in terms of technical advice. We need to provide fast, economic, and efficient solutions to make our customers' jobs and lives easier. In terms of credit, we help with commercial and pricing strategies, as the economy will be affected, and this will be a differentiator from the ones who do not work to assist their customers. We will have a clear promotion strategy for the rest of 4Q2020 and will launch innovations for specific products, such as fast-dry enamel. We launched an antibacterial paint in 2Q2020 that was initially due for 4Q2020 and was accelerated. The paint eliminates 99.9% of the four-most common bacteria and viruses in the country. It is not especially designed for COVID-19 but will be helpful for hospitals, schools, hotels, and housing. We have also included specific products in our portfolio, like an activator water for sanitizing purposes, as the commercial, hotel, offices, and government sectors that are working during the pandemic need to sanitize constantly. We also provide safety equipment to take these solutions to hotels, corporate buildings, and small businesses in order to create safe working environments. Another important area we focused on in 4Q2020 is the government's assistance to certain sectors to improve their facilities. One example is education, where the government provides financial assistance to be used for maintenance. Our Professional Division sales reps visit these schools and provide technical advice and specification advice in order to make the most of that aid and provide specific pricing promotions. In addition, the government extends credit for construction to promote the sector. With that credit, one is able to apply for new construction, remodelling, or small projects in their homes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ICEX progressed over the last year and half, and what have been some of its highlights during that period?</h4><p>In the last year, we have continued to help foreign companies to establish their businesses in Spain with an extensive range of services. However, we have adapted our strategy to the new challenges that we were facing, increasing our focus on the investment retention strategy and strengthening our aftercare policy with investors. We proceeded to support those actions with a policy advocacy approach in cooperation with other areas of the public administration to overcome uncertainty. We worked shoulder to shoulder with the Secretary of State for Trade's economic and trade offices abroad to have a clear understanding of the challenges that firms were facing in Spain in order to successfully assist them. Moreover, we sustained our support of greenfield projects that will foster economic growth and sustainable and inclusive employment in Spain while facilitating its integration with the local industry. Furthermore, we continue to attract talent with our Rising Up program addressed to third countries start-ups interested in developing their businesses in Spain, we progressed helping our start-ups to get foreign financing through open innovation activities and we launched a new call of our Smart Technological Fund, crucial in supporting R&amp;D projects. Talent and innovation are two key elements of sustainable foreign investment that will foster economic competitiveness.</p><h4>What measures has ICEX Invest in Spain carried out to mitigate the COVID-19 impact and continue generating FDI?</h4><p>Global FDI flows in the first half of 2020 were under severe pressure due to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to UNCTAD, foreign direct investment dropped 49% worldwide in the first semester of 2020. Spain also registered a drop in foreign investment, although not as intense as was observed in other countries. According to data by the Foreign Investment Register of the Secretary of State for Trade, foreign investment in Spain in the period of January to September 2020 dropped by 11% with respect to the same period in 2019. It should be stressed that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Spanish FDI figures was especially felt in the first quarter of the year. In fact, FDI received in Spain in the second and third quarters of 2020 was significantly higher compared to the amount received in the first three months of the year, and most importantly, is also higher than the amount received in the second and third quarters of 2019. Around June, many countries' borders reopened and investors resumed their activity and were able to travel and close deals. These figures indicate that, following the initial negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, investors reactivated their operations in Spain, reflecting the confidence of corporations in our country's macroeconomic fundamentals. In that context, the activity in Invest in Spain never decreased, quite the opposite. In our day to day activities, the first thing that we did to mitigate the pandemic effect was a thorough follow up of all our portfolio of ongoing projects. The Invest in Spain team has maintained constant communication with investors in an attempt to reduce uncertainty. In addition, our project managers have been very active reaching out to the potential investors and providing them with all the information required in their decision-making process. Since investment strategies are a long-term issue, most of the investors have continued with their assessment plans and we helped them in that endeavor. In addition to that and as it has happened in many other areas of the Spanish administration and among private companies, we switched the over 200 scheduled activities to an online format. Besides that, the very challenging moments that we were living have been a great opportunity to launch our new website: a more modern and functional tool that adds value to the services and programs that Invest in Spain offers and that will bring us closer to the investors. On top of this, we have strengthened our collaboration with sister agencies at a national as well as at an international level to share economic impact analysis of the sanitary crisis and discuss possible strategies to tackle this downturn. In those meetings we discussed the challenges that we were facing and the possible solutions to overcome them. To sum up, there have been three main lines of action to mitigate COVID's impact: proximity with the investors, digitalization and sharing of good practices.</p><h4>FDI from Latin America has increased by more than 200% over the last decade. What are the most important markets to attract investment to Spain?</h4><p>Traditionally, Latin America was seen as a prominent recipient of investment, but more recently the region has become an important source of foreign investment in the world. In Spain, Latin America is the fourth-largest investor after the US, the UK, and France. There are big companies in Latin America that are becoming increasingly important and competitive, who are looking for new business opportunities overseas. In that regard, these firms consider Spain as a platform to enter into other markets such as Europe and Africa. Spain's geostrategic situation, its cultural proximity, its legal framework, the infrastructures, the talent and quality of life that we offer makes our country especially appealing to Latin American companies. The footprint of Latin America in ICEX Action Plan is very important: we organize business fora, we assist Spanish companies to develop their internationalization strategy there and we promote among our firms business opportunities in the region. Moreover, concerning Invest in Spain , Latin America is a key element of our strategy of investment attraction that we organize around our Latam Desk. In Invest in Spain we have a specific focal point of information for and from Latin America that every year publishes the Global Latam study analyzing the trends in Latin American investment outflows. Our Rising up program, designed to attract talent into Spain, is very popular among the region's entrepreneurs too: in the last call, among the 15 winner companies, six were from Argentina and Brazil.</p><h4>What would be the main highlights of the Guide to Business Spain 2020?</h4><p>The Guide is a unique document available both in Spanish and English that gathers all the legal information useful to develop a business in Spain. It summarizes the main regulatory aspects governing investment in Spain, including the most important aspects of setting up and growing a company here. This year we included in the guide the majors regulatory changes that took place because of COVID-19. Among others, we covered all the financial support granted to companies and entrepreneurs. We incorporated some new issues related to intellectual property protection and an update of the 2030 Tourism Strategy developed by the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism. The upgrade in tax incentives for international shoots was also included.</p><h4>What sectors performed the best during the pandemic?</h4><p>All the sectors in the Invest in Spain project's portfolio have continued being very active. Nevertheless I would highlight as particularly dynamic during these months: life sciences, agrifood, logistics and transport and information and communications Technologies (ICT). In all those four sectors , activity has been thriving and investors have shown a great interest. <br>In the start-up ecosystem, projects have not been affected dramatically but we have remarked that investors have diversified their risks and invested in more companies, though in smaller amounts.</p><h4>What are your main priorities for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2021, the internationalization of the Spanish economy will continue to be part of the solution for the economic crisis brought on by COVID-19. We have to pay great attention to the changes that global value chains are experiencing. The shortening in those processes and a growing interest in some companies to get closer to their European clients, may bring new investment opportunities to Spain. In this context, we will work to develop new high value added projects that will foster potential GDP growth and sustainable job creation. At the same time, we will ensure seamless communication with the players involved in attracting and retaining those investment: network of economic and trade offices and regional directorates of the Secretary of State for Trade, autonomous regions, as well as the chambers of commerce of third countries in Spain. This public-private collaboration will help to improve business climate in Spain. But above all, we will keep working in close contact with foreign corporations to help them bring their projects to a successful conclusion.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors led to the company's successful second quarter in 2020 despite the pandemic?</h4><p>Traxion started seeing an opportunity way back, because logistics channels were under-penetrated in Mexico, especially those linked to e-commerce. Management saw an opportunity, and in 2018 we acquired a last-mile and parcel company, as we wanted a solid platform to seize on the opportunities that the market would ultimately provide. The pandemic was the catalyst of the logistics business, mainly e-commerce, last mile, distribution, warehousing, and so on. Traxion was positioned to capture that, which was a tremendous element of our results in 2Q and 3Q of 2020. We reported excellent results in the second quarter and even better in the third, which was a record quarter in every relevant financial metric, from revenues to net income. The company issued a MXN2.5 billion unsecured secure bond in September, and with that we were able to repay some liabilities and shift our debt to a long-term profile. We ended up with not only record high financial metrics but also less leverage, a strong balance sheet, and a comfortable cash position, the highest the company has ever had.</p><h4>What added value does Traxion bring to the market?</h4><p>Traxion is not only focused on large, tier-one players, but also on tier-two players such as department stores and smaller retailers that are less sensitive to price compared to other large companies, which struggle more with pricing. The added value is the service, as people were skeptical about e-commerce, which is why the sector was under-penetrated in Mexico. However, the pandemic forced people to turn to e-commerce, and they discovered that it not only works but is also efficient. People did not know if their package would even arrive. It is not like the US, where one can order six pairs of shoes, and if they do not like five of them, or they do not fit, the client can put them back in the box, attach a label, return it, and get a refund three days later with no questions asked. In Mexico, that is not possible now, and such infrastructure needs to be developed quickly. The value of Traxion is the high-quality service together with a one-stop, door-to-door solution across the whole supply chain. We are the only Mexican company capable of conducting such services by using both its own infrastructure and that of third parties.</p><h4>Why does the transportation sector in Mexico have a greater economic impact in comparison to other countries?</h4><p>Virtually everything in Mexico moves by truck as there is no other large or reliable alternative. We have two main sources of growth. Mexico has an attractive demographic bonus with a middle class that is growing. Pre COVID-19, everyone was spending, and that fuels internal consumption and makes transportation an important part of the GDP. Mexico also has a large manufacturing installed capacity- perhaps the most important in LatAm, and when we put that together with its geographic position, being the southern neighbor of one of the largest consumption economies in the world with access to two oceans, it is logistically convenient to operate in Mexico. We have virtually every car manufacturer in the world, with German, American, Korean and Japanese car manufacturers. We also have aerospace, medical devices, energy, and a number of other sectors of the economy that operate out of Mexico. Our demography and manufacturing capacity are the drivers of our growth. As infrastructure improves, with more highways and ports, it will improve further our sector.</p><h4>Do you plan to expand internationally or create better logistics solutions for Latin and North America?</h4><p>We are not planning to expand to other countries in the short or midterm, as we still see many attractive opportunities in Mexico. Cargo is a fragmented business, dominated by small players that are usually family-owned companies. There are few large fleets, so there is a great chance of consolidation there, and there are opportunities to grow organically regular cargo services by using third-party assets through technology and digitalization. We developed an app called Traxporta where we connect cargo operators with clients. We launched it in 2Q2020, so it is still new, and these are the kinds of opportunities we are taking in terms of technology and innovation. We are developing an asset-light model while taking care of the core business, which is still profitable, with excellent opportunities for growth. We have another division called Traxion Logistics, which is like the control tower that coordinates everything with Traxion subsidiaries, thus providing a one-stop solution, unique in Mexico. The idea is to provide all the services using Traxion or third parties and only bill one single invoice to the client.</p><h4>Do you plan to establish or acquire more companies in the coming years?</h4><p>It is not part of the current growth model of Traxion. Traxion was founded in 2011 and has acquired and successfully integrated seven companies, which resulted in significant synergies and economies of scale. However, since 2019 M&amp;A has no longer been a part of the plan. At the same time, we always analyze and take a look at opportunities, as we cannot deny that we come from an M&amp;A background, and if we encounter a great M&amp;A transaction we will likely take it, as pandemics and crises usually present various opportunities.</p><h4>What are your main goals and priorities for the rest of 2020 and for 2021?</h4><p>If we assume that the pandemic will continue in 2021, then our priorities are to keep providing capacity for our clients and seizing the opportunities that the logistics sector presents us. For example, the personal transportation segment is not efficient in Mexico, and the infrastructure has not changed much in the past decades and remains unsafe. Our clients need to provide their employees with an efficient and safe commuting option, which we provide. With the pandemic, our clients have started asking for increased capacity, as they could not transport 40 people in a bus due to social distancing. They needed twice or even thrice their original capacities, so we are now running more than 1,000 buses of over demand in that segment, in addition to our 5,500 bus fleet. We are temporarily satisfying that demand with a fleet that usually is dedicated to schools. We are also outsourcing rental units from local competitors with idle capacity. In cargo, we moved many of our trucks when the pandemic started, as the auto industry came to a halt and the panic shopping triggered. We later shifted our fleet from the auto industry to retail, consumer, and food and beverage sectors. The auto industry came back, and we shifted back, so we are facing continuous change. This will probably remain if the pandemic prevails. If the pandemic is under control and there is a vaccine or treatment in 1Q2021, then a potential return to normalcy would present us with growth opportunities, both organic or inorganic.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is longevity to the building of business relationships in the country and distinguishing EY from its competitors?</h4><p>EY Peru celebrates its first 60 years in Peru with a market position that is reflective of its continuous efforts to improve by providing its clients, friends, and the business community in general with access to knowledge. Building up a significant momentum is always a challenge since longevity today is accompanied by the challenge of “not being an old company," but rather using the experience to demonstrate its continued relevance in addition to the creativity and innovation in tailor-made solutions for each business segment. EY Peru continuously strives to connect the challenges of our clients with the power of the solutions that we provide locally, as well as across the global EY network. We strive to remain up to date and provide high-quality services with added value and passion to serve as if we were the clients ourselves. A successful entrepreneur projects its success onto society, meets the demands of their stakeholders, grows, provides employment, becomes international, and pays taxes, and therefore we measure our success through the success of those we help. If they win, we all win. In the last six years, we have taken a different path by sharing the development of soft skills and humanistic training with our own stakeholders. Therefore, we try to share culture as a whole and, within it, historical events so that we create a better future by learning about the past in a fun and scientific way.</p><h4>What does Peru bring to EY's global portfolio?</h4><p>We are proud to develop solutions in EY Peru that have been successfully applied in several countries across our global network, mainly in Latin America, but also in the US and Switzerland as well. Today, we share and receive recognition via the specialties in improving the operations and the results of the companies we serve, through various solutions in our areas of consultancy, taxation, strategy, transactions, and integrity. If we measure the performance of EY Peru through a trade balance between countries with an EY presence, EY Peru has a net exporting presence of services, greater than those that are imported. This is because of the fruitful exchange of solutions that we provide. We set aside a portion of the annual budget for innovation and to attract talent that allows us to renew our usual curiosity for what is new, disruptive, interesting, efficient, and offers a financial return for our clients and for us, always with the viewpoint of respect and care for what is socially responsible. In particular, we like to support undertakings at the forefront of technology and digital transformation that contribute to industry or business shifts.</p><h4>How is EY engaging with this issue of sustainability?</h4><p>We address the issue of sustainability through our loyal support to the sustainability of our clients' businesses. We need a healthy and thriving economy with successful clients. Therefore, we share efforts in each economic cycle, and we directly help society when the need for it is evident. For example, in 2020 we donated an oxygen plant to a Peruvian state hospital, and we also donated 250 tablets to a rural public school, among others. What is more, our nearly 1,800 contributors actively support at least 20 different sustainability initiatives in schools, parishes, shelters, and so on. However, perhaps where we can have the greatest impact is working with dedication to provide a culture of sustainability to our clients and friends and to assist clients in exceeding their goals and be successful in order for us to also form part of their success.</p><h4>As a leading consultancy firm, which sectors are performing best in this area?</h4><p>All sectors have distinguished performers, but the most successful ones are in mining, agribusiness, banking, and energy. Once we push through the pandemic, hotels and tourism also have great potential given Peru's rich history and culture. It is advisable for these companies to have a solid sustainability program that goes hand in hand with the necessary digital transformation. For example, during the pandemic, some telemedicine and delivery services had to upgrade their own sustainability with regard to the quality of the products and services they provided.</p><h4>What were the administrative methods related to human capital taken by businesses during the course of this pandemic?</h4><p>There are undoubtedly been multiple ways to manage the most important resource in a professional services company such as EY Peru. We have achieved this through transparency and projecting our message about taking care of our health and our families and continuing to provide quality services. We have focused on communication and emerging and consolidated leadership, as well as information and feedback to reduce the speculation and anxiety. Furthermore, we have created various innovation projects and adapted our day-to-day workings in order to be able to stand together during this difficult time. The main measure has been to increase the team of internal occupational physicians in order to provide preferential treatment to our collaborators when in need. In addition, connectivity has been a cornerstone since the beginning of the pandemic. Almost 100% of our people have been working online practically from day one. This has greatly facilitated our method of operating and serving, and it could not have been possible without the support of the EY Global network.</p><h4>What is your assessment of what this means for Peru bouncing back?</h4><p>We must focus on what is important and on activating the economy. This means focusing on obtaining and distributing vaccines quickly, returning to normal, and continuing to work. Peru is an emerging nation with great projects ahead in infrastructure and construction, the production of goods, and the provision of services. However, in order to embark on these big ventures, we need to have the health of the nation under control. Just as the Peruvian people are among the most recognized entrepreneurs in the world, given the high levels of entrepreneurship in the country, we must improve the legislation and the economic incentives available in order for the process to be faster and predictable. Therefore, the challenge for politicians is to remove the obstacles from the path of successful entrepreneurship and provide a rule of law that promotes business multiplication, which will be tested in the presidential and congressional elections in April 2021.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your goals for the organization after starting in late 2019?</h4><p>Ever since the inception of Saudi Airlines in 1945, SGS has enjoyed incredible market share and has been a reliable service provider of airport services. After the company went public in 2015, its focus has been on a few key pillars. The first of which is keeping our customers, namely the airlines and passengers, at the center of what we do. We used to treat them as one, but now we have segmented the two. We are now aware that airlines care about quality and cost, so we bring these two into equilibrium. Quality means turnaround time with on-time departure and the ability to meet growing needs. For example, during COVID-19 we had to start checking passenger's temperatures and to ensure that the travellers took PCR tests, and we were agile enough to do this quickly. The second part for airlines is cost, and we have dealt with that simply by deciding that we would no longer be margin driven. We enjoyed extremely high margins of around 20% for years, but we have decided to focus on value and lower the margins to encourage air travel, as a penny saved for airlines is a penny spent for them to bring in more passengers. We look at SGS not just as returning value for shareholders but also returning long-term value for shareholders. We are heavily focusing on institutional investments as opposed to individual shareholders. We want SGS to be a solution provider rather than a service provider, which means being a technology player. We have been rolling out technology solutions starting from 3Q2020 that will continue until the end of the year and include technology platforms and an e-marketplace.</p><h4>How has technology become a core piece of your internal transformation agenda?</h4><p>Technology has two folds: digitization and digitalization. The previous management had focused on digitization to drive the internal processes of the company by introducing ERP, SAP, archive, and automated correspondence systems, among others. This was to connect all operations between the front lines and HQ and to look at data in a way that could improve operations. After that, the digitalization part came next. We rolled out our first app with which SGS clients can improve the quality and safety of their operations. Users can now communicate with the relevant personnel through this app. The second app will be rolled out in early 2021; we are introducing an e-marketplace platform where services from our business and suppliers alike will be available. to bring the just-in-time concept of the automotive industry to aviation. We are not benchmarking with anyone in the world, but leading the way and creating a new territory where airports should be nothing more than efficient, functional security machines where one could show up to an airplane in the same fashion as showing up to a train. The execution of this means collection of baggage at malls and coffee shops around town and drop off at airports. In Dubai and Hong Kong, this concept already exists and has been well received. A few years ago, we were digitizing the company, and we are now digitalizing the experience of customers, including airlines and passengers. This includes aligning with the Kingdom's vision for tourism. This is indeed an exciting time to be a Saudi leading a Saudi company!</p><h4>What has the pandemic changed for you in the short and long term?</h4><p>Our revenues plunged by 85% as a result of COVID-19, but it is an extended break, and now we have time to make changes. We had a three-to-four-year plan for transformation, and we have completed it in nine months. The drive and momentum meant we could focus on the team. SGS is not just a classic ground services company, but the most experienced, efficient, and capable aviation team in the entire GCC. I am incredibly proud of the people we work with, as we are breaking waves with women not only on the front lines doing jobs, but also in the back office making strategic decisions in an industry that was recently very shy in terms of women's empowerment. We are attracting incredible brains across sectors such as food and beverage, retail, automotive, and petrochemicals with a collection of brainpower coming in from multiple industry backgrounds into aviation. We are also the only GCC-based aerospace entity to have its own innovation hub headed by a PhD researcher to develop our own solutions. That alone is a fundamental change which you will not see elsewhere. We are taking a deeply rooted publicly traded organization and are unshackling everything inside it in order act as a start-up. This attitude and culture could not have happened in nine months if it weren't for our determination to rise back up after the Covid-19 crisis.</p><h4>What efforts have you made to localize the airline industry in line with Vision 2030?</h4><p>We looked at our ground support technology and said we need access to technology, centers of excellence, and localization. We partnered with Alvest Equipment Services (AES) from France to create a 50/50 joint venture TLD Arabia Equipment Services. At the same time, we looked at the opportunity presented with COVID-19 in which sanitization in aircraft became a priority and concern globally. Honeywell worked on an ultraviolet UVC disinfection device with technology taken from hospital operating rooms to disinfect surgery tools. We opened a tender and, together with Honeywell, we designed a UVC disinfection device 100% made in Saudi, with 60% of the local components made in country. We do have an ambitious growth agenda, and we want to disrupt the entire aircraft experience globally as we are capable of doing so; however, we also have a national and social mandate with which we operate to ensure that we give back.</p><h4>What are your plans and expectations for the post-COVID-19 era?</h4><p>The first thing is to secure our cash position. We established a minimum sustainable resource strategy in January 2020 to ensure the company always had 24 months cash available on hand. This allows us to meet the growth that we want to invest in, and fortunately we had just finished developing the strategy when COVID-19 hit. We had put a target to shave every year for the next three years a minimum of 5% of our OPEX while increasing value. As a result of successfully overcoming the Covid-19 setback, we were able to shave 28% sustainably YoY. We also hired two data scientists to do data mining and plot the sensitivity and recovery of the market with cargo versus air traffic, vaccine rules, and other key indicators. We introduced the resulting model in March, and it is so accurate that governmental decision-making bodies in the Kingdom and our airline customers are asking it. Our own predictions because of the dynamics give us just over two years to three years maximum for a recovery. As such, we now have a competitive cost structure, an ambitious hub, technology solutions, and data scientists to bring all this together and devise the next evolution of solutions to enhance the travel experience. We are extremely optimistic about the future. The pandemic has supercharged our transformation into a different kind of company that is well positioned to capture value in the long term.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you decide to launch a business line for banking as a service?</h4><p>We decided to launch this business line at the end of 2018 because we wanted to access the retail banking segments, especially for individuals and SMEs. Banking as a service is a business model that runs on open banking. Open banking is just a technology and a capability to offer data to customers so that they can use it on other platforms and other players. We saw an opportunity to monetize open banking and built a business model that runs as a service that makes money out of open banking.</p><h4>How has the market reacted to your banking-as-a-service approach?</h4><p>There is a large appetite for this business model. First, it is a way to gain a new revenue stream. The other driver is that banking products are extremely engaging; if they have the capability to offer banking products to their customers, banks know they can engage their customers even more. The third one is data; banks will be able to gather data on their customers. For example, for other players such as e-commerce, that is perhaps not that relevant. However, for other players that are more traditional or transactional and do not know their customers that much, it is a great opportunity for them to gather data on their customers. In 2019, we developed our systems and opened our IT architecture with a layer of API so we could connect our back end, where the banking products are, with the front end of these partners. We also developed the products because we did not have them: an additional banking account, additional credit and debit cards, physical, digital, and so on. In 2020, we signed our first partnerships and are now launching them. This is a strategic bet. The pandemic is accelerating this trend significantly; this business model that two years ago was some an early discovery for us is now a reality. It is a reality that is gaining momentum worldwide so we are extremely pleased to have the opportunity to develop banking as a service in Mexico.</p><h4>In what ways did you have to adapt the business model of Banco Sabadell to adapt to the pandemic?</h4><p>In our case, we were extremely fortunate because this pandemic is accelerating the digital appetite of customers, and, therefore, we do not see the need to have branches. Our customers are demanding more digital banking products. We had some challenges in the past, such as regulatory obstacles. The pandemic is accelerating a change here, and regulatory changes now allow the digital onboarding of all banking products. That is a game changer for us, because we can now plan to expand to the whole country without needing a branch network.</p><h4>What are your expectations of the financial results of Banco Sabadell in 2020 in comparison to 2019?</h4><p>There is less activity, and we are heavily focused on business banking. Businesses in the country are reluctant to invest during the crisis. They are applying for banking credit less than before. General activity is lower than 2019 or even 2018. We are processing fewer operations, and that means fewer fees. There has been a reduction in the fees that we earn every year. The official interest rate has also been lowered because Banco de México needs to engage in a monetary expansion policy, and that will also have an impact on the P&amp;L of banks. In the case of the quality of our credit portfolio, as a bank we have lent mainly to medium and large companies in Mexico. We have no exposure to SMEs and to individuals who are the most vulnerable segments of the population during this crisis. Our credit portfolio is currently performing well, and we have the lowest impermanent credit index in the country. The interest rate fall will have an impact on our P&amp;L as well.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for Banco Sabadell in Mexico for the rest of the year and 2021?</h4><p>Our priorities are to be close to the economy, understand the trends and what the market is doing, and preserve a large portion of our liquidity and our solvency, which is subject to paramount metrics for a bank. We will also take care of the continuity of the operations, and that has to do with protecting the health of our employees. Our employees will remain at home at least until the end of the year. We will be preserving the quality of our portfolio; at the same time, we will expand our banking-as-a-service business model, sign more partnerships, and start the production of the ones that we have already signed. In 2021, I expect a recovery, though I do not know if it will be a full recovery. I expect a pretty clear recovery of the economy, and we will take advantage of that recovery.</p><h4>What is the profile of the companies you are looking to create partnerships with?</h4><p>We are looking mainly at retailers, both e-commerce and traditional; telcos, as they are interesting players; insurance companies; and last-mile companies as well. In the beginning, we thought fintechs did not make sense because they were small compared to other players in terms of customer base and they are competing with us. Still, we have since realized they are eager to offer products that only a bank can offer, and the only way for them to do so is through a banking-as-a-service partnership. We are also signing partnerships with fintechs. There is only one condition: a minimum customer base, which is extremely important because if they are tiny, it does not make sense for us to sign a partnership. The other condition is that they need to have certain capabilities online. For example, if they are a traditional retailer, they must have some digital capability, such as a wallet or an app. They know this is something they need to deploy even further.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Prologis, an American multinational with a presence in Spain since 1999, has become one of the main players in the Logistics real estate industry in Spain as well as in Europe, with 2.5% of global GDP going through its buildings around the world. What has been the company's evolution in Spain?</h4><p>Prologis in Spain started in 1999 in the region of Catalonia with the first high-level park developed in Spain. At the time, there were no private parks with broad maneuvering spaces or as innovative as the one that Prologis brought to the market ESFR sprinklers, docks at 90º, skylights, high clear heights, slab flatness quality, and in turnkey basis. It was a turning point for the industry in Spain. Subsequently, we developed a similar park in Alcala de Henares, in Madrid, with four units measuring 113,000sqm and following the same concept. The park in Catalonia is located in Sant Boi and was a public-private partnership developed with the city hall. Meanwhile, in Alcala de Henares we have a large closed land. Logistics at the time were not highly viewed by the public administration. It was seen as an industry that brought many blue-collar jobs, a great deal of pollution, traffic, noise, and scattered buildings that were not aesthetic because their only purpose was to store goods. We arrived under that context in Spain and worked to change this perception. We are global leaders, and other companies follow our lead.</p><h4>The logistics real estate industry, due in part to the growth in the food and e-commerce sectors, has successfully navigated COVID-19. You assumed your current position as Country Manager at the end of 2019. How has the COVID-19 challenge been for you?</h4><p>It has been a challenge, though not that much because we know the business extremely well. 50% of our staff is located in Madrid and the other 50% in Barcelona. Videoconference platforms have been great tools to maintain communications. We have been a 100% digital company for many years, as at a single click we have all the information of the entire portfolio that we manage, one of the resources included in our Prologis FM digital platform. This digital aspect clearly enabled us to adapt quickly to the pandemic. The secret to successfully ride out the pandemic is to be in constant communication with our teams &amp; customers. We are a reduced team, but extremely flexible and efficient. We have 1.2 million sqm and only employ 13 people, and that make us extremely agile. We love changes and are open to them. Success involves innovation and adaptability to changes.</p><h4>With 1.2 million sqm of logistics assets in Spain, the sky is the limit for Prologis. What lies ahead and what strategy will you follow to achieve it?</h4><p>There is no limit for us. Our goal is to do things well, and our strategy is clear. We are long-term investors and are here for the long haul. In the buildings we manage, we are already thinking about the next 12 years. With that outlook, we are thinking of buildings that will remain in the market for the next 12 years. We have a diversified platform in the main markets in Spain, namely Madrid, Valencia, and Barcelona. We have clients in many different sectors and high-quality assets in the best locations, and we can serve clients in many different industries. Our buildings measure every single detail. We have our own lab where we test everything that we want to implement. It is a space to test many different things before we launch them into the market. Our added value is eliminating the so-called pain points for our customers and we provide them with everything that has to do with the operation of the buildings so that they can focus on their own business. As market leaders, we have a responsibility to remain innovative. We have to always stay ahead.</p><h4>What room is there to innovate in the logistics industry, and what new innovations are entering the market?</h4><p>Innovation is constant. There is a great deal of innovation in automation, though it is not here to replace workers; the innovation is complementary to employees. All e-commerce activities are highly labor intensive, and in some locations workforce is a problem because there is no skill worked for some processes. It is difficult to find experts in logistics in certain locations, so we have a specific division within Prologis to train employees where we teach the profession to all of them and help them to develop professionally in the logistics sector. Innovation is part of Prologis' DNA, and innovation in building design is one of our strengths. These designs help to make buildings more efficient. One of our milestones is the development of 4.0 logistic buildings. The term 4.0 is related to the capacity to connect these buildings to the internet, which help the buildings talk among themselves. We have implemented sensors in our buildings to monitor a great deal of information; for example, we can learn in advance when a gate needs maintenance and can prepare ahead of time the materials required to fix every single gate in our parks. Prologis is completely focused on its clients. We are a customer-centric business, so we analyze all possible problems that customers might encounter because we want them to focus on what they do best while we take care of everything related to the building.</p><h4>Following the purchase of the 473,000-sqm portfolio of Colonial's logistics assets in 2020, Prologis acquired three buildings in Puerta de Madrid Logistics Park. What does this project mean for the company, and what are its main characteristics?</h4><p>We recently completed the acquisition San Fernando de Henares is extremely important to us, since it is one of the main logistic areas of Spain. San Fernando is ideal for last mile and the most conventional logistics. In addition to our acquisitions, we have land that we developed ourselves in San Fernando. Its location is unbeatable.</p><h4>One of the key needs of companies is decentralizing production. How do you evaluate this?</h4><p>We see emerging trends occurring. To date, logistic units tend to be close to the factories. The trend today, however, is the opposite, which is to put the logistics unit as close to the end customer as possible. Part of that change is because factories are now located overseas, for example China. We have learned from the pandemic that one cannot have all its factories in China, because if the country closes down, the company cannot deliver products. Consumption now is all about immediacy; people want things delivered quickly. The key in e-commerce is to have products close to the customer. According to one of our Prologis Research reports, e-commerce needs thrice the logistics space of a commercial store, and that implies thrice the number of employees. E-commerce is, therefore, extremely labor intensive. We must take into account that e-commerce grew by 30% from March to mid-April, according to market data analyzed by Prologis Research. Spanish market still has huge room of growth in the e-commerce sector, so we will be looking at it over the time. Thanks to its resilience, the real estate for logistics has continued to operate well during the pandemic.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on Prologis Essentials' Marketplace?</h4><p>We have reached an agreement with the best brands in the market to acquire many items for our clients at an affordable price, all of which can it be found on Prologis Essentials Marketplace. Another project we have launched is the ParkLife initiative to offer well-being services such as a field court, gym, and different amenities for workers in the industrial park. We will also have a parking area for carpooling, among many other features. This is a business that will only continue to grow. There are many opportunities in the logistics sector. At Prologis we promote a customer-centric model, where customers are at the center of all our operations and decisions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Created in 2007, EDF Solar specializes in photovoltaic self-consumption installations and holds 60% market share in Spain. How would you describe the company's evolution and its key milestones?</h4><p>In 2007, there was a bubble in the Spanish renewable energy industry that is somewhat similar to what it is happening today, although currently the sector is more mature and professional. In the beginning, we focused on renewable generation projects, when the sector started to realize there had to be a different path to the one that had been laid down. The first moratorium took place, and we had to adapt to a new reality and switch our business model to the self-consumption business. Two years went by in which we did not conduct any projects, and in 2011 we developed our first electricity self-consumption project. To date, we have completed almost 2,000 self-consumption units that are currently into operation. It is important to highlight that we started in a sector that was unregulated, and one of our milestones has been regulating the sector. We were the first and only self-consumption Spanish company for many years. As a result, we managed to help draft regulations despite the industry opposition and lack of understanding from the government. In 2015, there was a decree that implemented the so-called “sun tax“ that was extremely harmful for self-consumption. That decree was in effect until the current Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera Rodrí­guez approved a new regulation.</p><h4>What are some of your most iconic projects over the years, and which sectors do you work the most with?</h4><p>We greatly appreciate the first projects that we completed in our early years. Most of them were in Galicia, an autonomous community where we have installed 40MW in self-consumption, which is 95% of the total installed capacity in the self-consumption sector. We conducted a project for Avicola Lago that is special for us and which we always like to mention. All our projects are important to us, no matter their size. We are working in niche segments. We study where we want to develop ourselves and seek to achieve that through our strategy. There are sectors where we have contracts with 90% of the sector, for example. We have a strong focus on the food industry, where we participate in every sector of the production chain. We identified this sector as a priority for us, and during the pandemic it has been a resilient sector that has performed extremely well despite the situation. Our experience differentiates us. There are many large firms seeking to establish a partnership with us to become a provider. We have extensive experience, and that makes us unique. In our segment, which is focused on industry, it is extremely difficult to develop a company such as ours.</p><h4>In 2019, you grew between 40 and 50% compared to 2018. 2020 saw the arrival of the pandemic, which has affected all sectors differently. How has COVID-19 affected the company, and what measures have you taken to mitigate the impact?</h4><p>We expect to grow by 20% in 2020 compared to the year before; that is the goal we have set in our business plan. We will achieve it, which is great news. We have modified our client segment, however, and are doing just 200 projects, rather than 400. We are reducing the number of projects we are working on in order to focus on a specific type of client. The goal is to create a solvency that will allow us to grow in other segments. This means our focus is to consolidate ourselves with a specific type of client.</p><h4>There is still a long way to go regarding regulation self-consumption sector. The repeal of the sun tax and the approval of the RD in 2014 have been positive changes, but what still remains to be done?</h4><p>Minister Ribera was brave enough to change perceptions in the self-consumption sector. We are an active player in the sector, which is facing some challenges because of COVID-19. As for the new regulation, we are an active player in the existing associations that promote self-consumption. The industrial segment has been somewhat neglected by the public sector. We are still regulated under the decree of 2020. And in that change of energy mode, in which a distributed generation model should be a priority, Spain is at the forefront of this sector at a global level. That should be regulated. There should be a single regulation for the country as a whole and not vary from region to region, as is the case currently.</p><h4>The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan sets a target of 39GW of photovoltaic power to be installed by 2030. Is that achievable?</h4><p>Spain is capable of the best, but is commonly known as the worst. That is why we are not able to self-administer ourselves as a country. There is an important level of energy generation, though there is no limit. There is a bottleneck and a situation of lack of control. There is currently a great deal of speculation. That goal of reaching 39GW before 2030 will be met even before 2030.</p><h4>EDF Solar recently signed a commercial cooperation agreement with Gestión Servicios to strengthen its sales channel in Catalonia and Aragon. What other expansion plans are on the horizon?</h4><p>We have a strong presence in Catalonia and we are in Aragon as well. Gestion Servicios is our partner and will help us strengthen our commercial challenge. There are regions where we have faced difficulties in enter such as Andalucí­a. We recently started operations in Extremadura and have also strengthened our operations in Castilla La Mancha. We are focusing on Andalucí­a and want to grow in that region. Another issue is that this sector is facing a certain lack of professionalization since we sometimes compete with companies that do not have a business plan. That lack of professionalization brings prices down, and these prices are so low that it will be challenging for many companies to operate in the short term. That lack of professionalization does not add value to the product, and that allows clients to seek the lowest prices. If this continues, the sector cannot generate high-skilled jobs and research and development.</p><h4>What added value do you provide to your product, and what impact do you have on society?</h4><p>We offer a service to generate energy; that is what we do. There are many platforms and items to add value to the product. It can be connected to the cloud, and we can include batteries or management services. We offer many services that can add value, and this is highly appreciated by the market. We have to add new technologies and come up with new methods to generate energy. Adding value to the product is essential.</p><h4>What is your main goal for 2021?</h4><p>This year, we have met our goals, and we want to meet our goals in self-consumption in 2021. We have more than 420MW in current development in generation. We are developing a branch for the commercialization electric power and want to integrate that business into our company. In that branch, we will generate our own renewable energy and will sell it to third parties. We want to provide tailor-made services to our 2,000 clients and also foster a feeling of community within the company. That is the biggest and most important challenge. We want every employee to feel they are part of a single unit, so we are implementing a program in an attempt to foster that feeling.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide an overview of your key lines of business and clients in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have been extremely successful in harnessing the power of Esri's geospatial services platform for Saudi clients. Our services extend far beyond traditional mapping and include the collection, processing, and geo-representation of data. Data-based decision-making has become extremely critical to policy in the Kingdom, so this is an important moment for us. Esri Saudi Arabia addresses the entire industry of geospatial services, which covers maps, licenses, services, professional services, and building platforms for analytics. We have around 170 products available in our catalog, all related to this core mission of making sense out of data and gathering information. From a legacy perspective, we used to only provide the ArcGIS base map, but it has evolved over time. Now, geospatial services and various platforms are combined under one hub called an atlas. It is not only one service, system, or dataset but a combination of many elements. It can be defined as the hub of hubs or platform of platforms, as we combine all this under the umbrella of the geospatial atlas, known as the Industrial Esri Atlas. We work across industries including health, education, industry, oil and gas, central government, and national security. One of the core global businesses for Esri has always been central government with security and defense. In the last five years, we leveraged education, health, and oil &amp; gas. These trends also apply in Saudi.</p><h4>Esri's solution has been essential for the Ministry of Health and the wider government during the pandemic. What was the process of setting up this solution, and what makes it useful in this context? </h4><p>We started in February 2020 at the time when the Covid 19 reported cases were surging in the kingdom with the Ministry of Health trying to work on a tool of representation in order to calculate and identify the future impact of the pandemic. We used one of our solutions, which can be adapted to different industries and tweaked it to be applicable to the COVID-19 situation. We adapted a solution that John Hopkins University with the help of Esri have implemented and  used to track the pandemic, which has been shared widely on social media platforms and replicated the dashboard for the Saudi Arabian context. This has been a key public tool for the ministry in the effort to manage the pandemic across the Kingdom. You are able to view for every city what the historic and current data for the pandemic is. We launched this in May when the pandemic was at its peak, and this was one of the major assets that helped the authorities have a full overview of the situation. We would call this as the command and control for the pandemic since all hospitals and 90,000 governmental health centers around the Kingdom are connected to one platform with live data. You can see the data in each city for Covid 19 test results in real time, all reflected immediately. Every day, the Ministry of Health presented this data during its daily spokesmen briefings, and it is the only official result of Covid-19 within Saudi Arabia. All other government agencies also take their data from this. We are also working on the back end with predictive analysis to understand where we are heading. There is a global second wave of COVID-19 where the numbers in Europe and the US have surged significantly, but in Saudi the numbers are still contained at a much lower level. This is one of the advantages that our solution provides: a predictive analysis of where things will happen within the coming period of three months, six months, a year, or five years. It gives the Ministry of Health an understanding of where we are going and is the reason why Saudi Arabia did not lock down again. This gives us a roadmap vision as the important element for every atlas to build on is predictive analysis. If we know when we will be hitting a second wave in Saudi Arabia then it would allow authorities  for more staffing, beds, ICUs, CAPEX, OPEX, and investment to be planned.</p><h4>What other government projects are being built, and how do you prepare an agency to use your solution?</h4><p>It is a long process, you cannot instantly launch a project in response to an an RFP to build an SDI, a portal or an Atlas ; you would have first to respond to their pain, requirements and offer the needed vision broken maybe into phases to implement the road map , and every step has to be audited. Your data, systems, and capabilities have to integrate with the platform, as one system can make the entire atlas ineffective. We are also working on a larger project that has taken us two or three years to build its vision ,roadmap with the Ministry of Health, which is the health atlas for Saudi Arabia, which will track all manners of metrics and data for the government and will bring information from across the health sector together in a cohesive way. We have already built the industrial atlas and an economical atlas with the Ministry of Economy and Planning and are currently developing an educational atlas as well for the Ministry of Education. Esri is as well working on the national SDI, which is one of the elements where we prepare the agency or industry for one unified data infrastructure so that it can have its data disseminated across every other Government agency and to the central national Geoportal. In National Security and defense, we implemented the first of a kind  911 center in Riyadh, which we did not have in the past in Saudi. We took the best-case studies and expertise of Esri for 911 similar operations whether in the US or globally and implemented in Saudi, which required tremendous efforts to build and combine over 14 national security systems as a national security Dashboard, and this is a significant achievement.</p><h4>Where do you see growth in the future, and what are the most interesting new technologies you are introducing?</h4><p>Esri is heavily committed to R&amp;D (30% from the total revenue). We spend more than Apple's R&amp;D budget per year. In 2019, Esri launched many new apps: Tracker, ArcGIS Indoors, Excalibur Notebook Server, Monitor, Inspire and ArcGIS Earth, Hub and Insights. We are all familiar with Esri outer maps, but the new innovative way is now indoor mapping. Currently, there is a city and individual buildings. With City Engine, one can navigate the city in 3D. With ArcGIS Indoors, you can go inside of the buildings and navigate. In Saudi Arabia, KAUST adopted this system and is now facilitating it for faculty members, visitors, and students. ArcGIS Insights that we used for the COVID-19 dashboard and platform to give analysis and predictive reports. We even transformed some of the informational data into a new solution and started something called Crowd Management, which we used in several locations. Every year, Saudi Arabia hosts the pilgrimage of hajj and umrah, where full crowd management of 3 million people is handled through the Esri Crowd Management solution. That is the future we are building with our innovative solutions. We still have all these solutions that were implemented in Europe and the US 10 years ago, so for innovation and the future you need to build an infrastructure first, which is a significant change in Saudi.</p><h4>How have you performed in revenue terms lately?</h4><p>In 2017, we had SAR32 million in revenue, and this grew to SAR46 million in 2018, SAR62 million in 2019, and SAR120 million this year. This is a significant jump and shows how the expansion has happened within Esri Saudi and the industry itself. In the past, some agencies did not even have workstations or laptops, but there was still a dream to build a GIS system. We have been fortunate in the past two years in Saudi, as digital transformation has played a big role to develop agencies so that we could leverage with our work and show our “magic“. COVID-19 was a saviour this year in terms of Esri's growth, and we have not had one layoff or salary reduction during the pandemic while all commercial and government agencies went on cutting their salaries. We increased our growth and revenue and are closing this year SAR120 million confidently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant developments at Hutchison Ports BEST in the last year?</h4><p>We cannot escape the consequences of COVID-19, though Hutchison Ports BEST has been able to keep to its business plan. Our strategy is to continue to differentiate ourselves through our service level as well as to keep delivering some of the best berth productivity in the world (over 40 moves per hour) with rapid and efficient rail and gate operations on the land side. At the same time, we are also increasing our rail market share through our strategy of expanding our hinterland and reaching new destinations in Spain and the South of France through our rail operator named Synergy. Our main goal is to bring cargo from northern Spain to Barcelona with better transit times and a more efficient supply chain solution, adding value for shippers and shipping lines. During 2020, we focused our investment on increasing our reefer capacity more than 70% and today BEST is able to connect more than 2,000 reefer containers at the same time, one of the highest capacities for a maritime terminal in the Med area. We are also investing in technology to speed up the digitalization process launching a new app and going through a standardization of processes to improve our efficiency and the use of our resources. At the same time, we have reinforced our focus in investment on Cybersecurity actions to increase the resilience of our terminal. In summary, during 2020, we continued with our current investment plans, fine-tuning our operations to improve performance, and launching new products to the market thus ensuring that shipping lines and shippers operate more efficiently when using our facilities.<br></p><h4>An important milestone in 2020 was welcoming MSC Sixin, the first 23,000-plus TEU containership to call at Barcelona. What does this mean for the company and BEST?</h4><p>MSC Sixin calling at BEST was another milestone in our short history. BEST continues to exceed all standards. In terms of crane productivity, when we designed the Terminal, our goal was to achieve 35 moves per hour, and we now have sustained performance at over 40 moves per hour. To improve our capability on these vessels, we increased the height of some of our cranes. BEST is the only terminal in the Med with eleven cranes all of them able to operate these vessels. When MSC Sixin called at BEST, not only were we prepared for the challenge, but we also managed to improve productivity levels.</p><h4>How is your strategy to expand Barcelona's refrigerated container services progressing?</h4><p>Over the last few years, we have focused on refrigerated containers; as I mentioned before, BEST has not only improved reefer capacity by 70% but has also introduced new services within the terminal such as PTI (Pre-Trip Inspection), cleaning, and repair of reefers containers. All these services aim to reduce the shipping lines transportation costs and also minimize the environmental impact by reducing transportation in and out of the terminal. Both COVID-19 and growing food exports, especially to China, have proven us right in our strategy and vision. Stricter regulations now also require all perishables to be shipped in reefer containers. This is a business segment with an upward trend potential in the next few years.</p><h4>COVID-19 has affected all kind of sectors of the economy, one of which is port traffic. Port of Barcelona's container traffic recorded a 19.6% fall between January and August. How would you assess the impact of this on BEST's operations?</h4><p>We were not immune to the volume loss experienced by the Port of Barcelona, but as I always say, “one should never waste a crisis" and we have taken advantage of this situation by improving operations and fine-tuning our processes. However, despite all that, we still have peaks in operations, and we need to have the resources ready to be able to perform with the largest vessels and the related impact on berth, land and gate facilities. The 23,000-plus TEU vessels calling at BEST are the consequence of shipping lines having restructured their services and managing their capacity by concentrating their cargo in fewer vessels.</p><h4>There have been incentives to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. How has this helped your operations?</h4><p>COVID-19 has changed many things; for example, we had to establish new procedures for general cleaning and disinfecting machinery to protect our workers and keep the supply chain alive. This is an important new cost for terminal operators which also causes delays between shift changeovers. The authorities need to realize that operators and the economy need some help, and this is the issue that the authorities have aimed to address with their incentives. It is important to mention that the Port of Barcelona was and is very close to the situation working in parallel to guarantee that the supply chain keeps moving. At BEST, we were able to avoid implementing any furlough scheme on our personnel and as such did not require those incentives provided by the Government.</p><h4>What are BEST's main priorities and goals for 2021?</h4><p>Our plan is to keep expanding our hinterland. In times like these, companies usually reassess their status quo, and it is a good time to review the current paradigm and put new value propositions on the table. BEST will focus on the south of France and expand some of its services, such as reefer-related ones within the terminal. We are also focusing on our rail terminal operation and services, along with further digitalization and standardization. Given the European Custom regulations, maritime terminal operators will have to face new responsibilities that bring us new and complex risks but, at the same time, new opportunities to create value and services as an AEO (Authorized Economic Operator). Last but not least, as previously mentioned, our productivity is one of the best in the world, however this is not enough, we need to continue working diligently and in a humble manner in order to be closer to the customer, faster in operation and greener to create a competitive advantage for our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>From our <a href="https://www.thebusinessyear.com/shop/special-report/investing-in-turkey">Investing in Turkey Special Report</a>.<br></p><h4><br></h4><h4>Memorial Healthcare Group has stood out for its specialization in organ transplants. Can you outline some of the group's successes in the area?</h4><p>Memorial Healthcare Group is the reference point in areas like adult and pediatric liver, kidney and bone marrow, heart surgery, general surgery, oncology, urology, cardiology, IVF, and neurosurgery. We continue to be the center of excellence for patients in Turkey and from all around the world awaiting an organ transplant. In our Memorial Åžişli Organ Transplant Center, in a world first, our team performed simultaneous liver and kidney transplants on a 7-kg baby. In our Memorial Bahçelievler Hospital, our team successfully performed a liver transplant from a live donor without using blood or blood products for the first time. Among private hospitals groups in Turkey, we lead the world in robotic organ transplants from live donors with Dr. Volkan Tuğcu taking the lead at Memorial Bahçelievler Kidney Transplant Center. Some 85% of our transplants are from live donors. With our scientific research and new applications, we continue to host many doctors from around the world in our various of departments to learn and gain benefit from our expertise. We are home to the leading organ transplantation centers of the world with approximately 350 kidneys, 265 liver, and 400 bone marrow transplants per year. We are proud of not only the numbers but also the success rates of these surgeries.</p><h4>What are some of the technology investments Memorial is making?</h4><p>Memorial Healthcare Group values technological investments that lead us to have international success in complicated branches. It takes high technological screening innovation to have success in diagnosis and treatment. Most of these technologies are being applied for the first time in Turkey simultaneously with the world. We use exclusive technologies like Pet-CT, to diagnose cancer and for staging at an early stage. In addition, for cancer treatments, we use radiotherapy practice with TrueBeam STx and Elekta Versa HD Signature technologies. We provide an exclusive service with three Tesla MR screening system with extensive tunnel diameter for patients with claustrophobia, also with high-level screening technology devices in heart health such a cardiac MR, cardiac BT, and three-dimension echocardiography. We successfully use Da Vinci XI technology, which is being used particularly for urology as well as gynecology and general surgeries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>From our <a href="https://www.thebusinessyear.com/shop/special-report/colombia-energy-mining">Colombia Energy &amp; Mining Special Report</a>.</p><h4>What have been the company's greatest achievements in Colombia?</h4><p>Veolia has been in Colombia since the 1990s, focused on the issue of water, waste, and, more recently, energy efficiency. In water, we are a respected name; we are participating in large concessions in Tunja and Monteria where we have been serving for more than 20 years. We have extended the Tunja contract until 2026, and will maybe extend it further, until 2034. Previously, Tunja did not have complete coverage and suffered from lack of continuous service and operational problems. Today, with the same infrastructure, it has coverage 24 hours a day, water of the highest quality, and an excellent uncounted water ratio of 16%. In Colombia, this number is usually 36%. We have been innovating with technology, waste collection, and disposal. We have 11 environmental parks where we manage the disposal of solid waste. Hubgrade, a registered trademark of Veolia, is for energy efficiency issues, specifically for monitoring and control, so that our customers can reduce their CO2 footprint. We have a large global network through the company. On a global level, Veolia is increasingly oriented toward the industrial sector. In Colombia, our client base is composed of 70% municipal clients and 30% industrial clients.</p><h4>Veolia has been focusing on becoming a responsible company committed to the future of Colombia. How does this translate to your focus on the future?</h4><p>Veolia's rationale is to contribute to human development through a series of environmental strategies and policies to maintain resources and have better access to them. We are focused on circular economies from the point of view of sustainability. For example, for plastics, we have global agreements with companies like Nestlé, so that in five years, the plastic they produce can be recycled. With energy, we try to produce it with our waste.</p><h4>Veolia renewed an agreement with the Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI). How does your private approach relate to this agreement?</h4><p>We want a better environmental education, so this agreement's objective is to manage a program that caters to children of low and medium resources in the seven countries where we are present. With the program and through their artistic expressions, they can imagine a way to transform the world into a better place. Some 35,000 children in Latin America have participated.</p><h4>What is Veolia's relationship with the oil and gas sector, and how will you continue to serve this sector?</h4><p>This sector is vital to us since it has to do with our commitment to encouraging circular economies, in terms of environmental protection and upstream and downstream management. We are working hard in this sector with Ecopetrol. We are growing gradually in the refinery space.</p><h4>Veolia wants to eliminate the emission of 6.6 billion kg of CO2 annually. What are other achievements planned for 2020 and beyond?</h4><p>In two of our environmental parks, we are already working to reduce CO2 emissions. This CO2 emission reduction management is audited, which allows us to have resources for the sale of carbon bonds later. We are reducing CO2 emissions when we use energy efficiently or when we use waste to produce energy. We are taking these actions in hospitals, shopping centers, and large buildings. Another goal is to increase our portfolio of industrial clients. To help with this, we will use the hub-grade system to create better and smarter ways of managing energy, water, and waste. In water management, Colombia is doing well. As large cities already have efficient operators, we want to focus on medium-sized cities that do not have the same capabilities as Bogotá or Medellí­n. Regarding energy efficiency, we are working with Coca-Cola Femsa in Barranquilla on the construction of a turbine that will generate cold, heat, and energy for the Barranquilla heat plant. This is a great template of what we want to pursue in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

How will real estate and construction capitalize on this growth?</h4><p>The relationship between real estate and the economy is symbiotic. When the economy performs well, we see an uptick in real estate transactions. Conversely, a boost in investments in the property market activates other sectors of the economy. Dubai's real estate has been a vital aspect of the UAE's non-oil economy, bringing investments from all over the world. Today, Dubai is witnessing economic growth on the back of key government initiatives such as long-term visas for investors and skilled professionals, 100% foreign ownership of businesses, and the establishment of the Higher Committee for Real Estate. Consequently, these initiatives are having a positive impact on the real estate market. In November 2019, the Dubai Land Department recorded over 5,000 transactions, marking an 11-year high. Additionally, with Expo 2020 on the horizon and its projected impact on the Emirate's GDP, we are confident that the real estate market, which has been witnessing a cyclical slowdown over the last two years, will stabilize. Moreover, the government's foresight, best exemplified in the theme for 2020, which focuses on creating a growth strategy for the next five decades, reaffirms the positive long-term outlook for non-oil sectors.</p><h4>As DAMAC completes its 40,000-plus units in progress, what trends will impact luxury real estate development in Dubai? </h4><p>To achieve a balance between supply and demand, developers must limit new launches. At DAMAC, we are focused on projects that are already in the construction pipeline, and we have adopted this prudent strategy to ride softer market conditions and enable long-term growth. The concept of luxury real estate is changing, and today it is more about the experience of living in a holistic environment. Given this trend, the real estate sector is evolving into a service industry, in which delivering units is just the beginning of the relationship between the developer and the customer.</p><h4>Dubai's boldness, when it comes to innovative construction and development models, is undeniable. How does DAMAC align with this when undertaking projects? </h4><p>Dubai's majestic skyline and real estate infrastructure inspire people from all over the world. However, Dubai is evolving, and customers expect more than just great interiors and brand associations. They are looking for wholesome communities that align with their personalities, passions, and lifestyles. At DAMAC, we have been at the forefront of creating properties that align with our customers' aspirations. Our multi-million sqft, mixed-use master developments, DAMAC Hills and AKOYA, offer a glimpse of the future of luxury living. At DAMAC Hills, for example, we provide a diverse range of luxury residential villas, townhouses, and apartments to meet the different needs and desires of customers along with a plethora of community spaces, activities, and amenities for residents to enjoy. The 18-hole Trump International Golf Course Dubai, a horse stable, a 4-million sqft park, a skatepark, a tennis academy, supermarkets, and various other life-enhancing features make this community luxurious and appealing to different customer segments.</p><h4>DAMAC was recognized as Property Developer of the Year by International Business Magazine. How does DAMAC Properties plan to lead the luxury real estate sector?</h4><p>DAMAC has been a pioneer in introducing branded luxury residences in Dubai and around the world. We have created iconic projects in association with the world's most renowned brands such as Just Cavalli, Paramount Hotels and Resorts, and Versace Home, to name a few. Our brand promise is 'Live the Luxury,' and we have exemplified our vision by delivering over 4,000 branded residential and hotel units so far. Our approach to luxury has always aligned with the evolving aspirations of our discerning customers, and we will continue with this approach in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the bank in Morocco? </h4><p>Since the end of 2019, we have conducted an assessment of the bank's operations in the country over the 2008-2018 period. The purpose of this exercise was to bring transparency within the framework of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Some of the results of this review include: 3.5 million people, more than half of them women, having improved access to clean water and sanitation; 8.5 million people, including more than 4 million women, benefiting from improved health services; nearly 7 million people were connected to the electricity grid; and 16 million people gained better access to transport infrastructure. As far as our strategy is concerned, the priority is to accelerate the pace of achieving the “High 5" priorities that contribute to the implementation of more than 90% of the 2030 SDGs. Our objective is clear: to have an impact, increasingly significant, for the benefit of our beneficiaries. In doing so, we are using a new generation of instruments such as results-based financing, deployed in Morocco since the end of 2018. Finally, our vision will be articulated on the basis of a more inclusive development approach, with social and territorial inclinations. An integrated development approach to support the attractiveness of the territories, the modernization of infrastructures, the industrial acceleration of the country, and the improvement of its logistic competitiveness. At the same time, our support will focus on human development by strengthening the education and health systems, improving access to basic social infrastructure, and opening up rural areas.</p><h4>What main operations are in progress?€¨</h4><p>Development is a process with many prerequisites, including support for private-sector development, coupled with a dynamic of industrialization and strengthening of logistics competitiveness with an inclusive development approach that prioritizes two axes: the development of human capital and the attractiveness of the territories. For a development trajectory to tend toward emergence, it must be sustainable, accompanied in particular by a committed energy transition. These are some of the areas in which we have been working alongside the country since the bank's creation. As part of this approach, we approved four new operations at the end of 2019. First, we will finance, to the tune of EUR245 million, a program to develop electricity transmission networks and rural electrification to improve the safety and efficiency of electricity supply. It will also promote the development of renewable energy sources by ensuring the integration of additional electricity production, which will be generated by solar and wind energy sources, currently under development. More than 16,000 households in 720 villages will be connected to the electricity grid. To reinforce the inclusive nature of our action, we have invested in strengthening and expanding social protection in Morocco by providing more than USD200 million by extending social coverage to people with disabilities, vulnerable children, and women. The goal is to increase the rate of compulsory health insurance coverage from 62% of the population in 2018 to more than 80% in 2023. The program will make it possible to build a regional hospital in Guelmim and a specialty hospital in Ouarzazate, each with a capacity of 140 beds. It also provides for the creation of 144 units specializing in the care of people with special needs and the upgrading of the infrastructure and equipment of 100 dispensaries in rural areas. These units will be equipped with telemedicine equipment for rapid and remote patient care. Two other new projects are designed to strengthen the inclusive dimension of our action. The first involves USD220 million to fund the program to support the industrial competitiveness of the regions by equipping territories with new industrial infrastructure in order to strengthen the regions' contribution to the national process of industrial acceleration. The second project, totaling EUR100 million, will benefit the Municipal Equipment Fund in order to set up new industrial activities and improve the quality of public services in rural areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>GFT's revenues in 2019 increased by 4% to EUR428 million compared to the year before. How has the company and its operations evolved since 2019?</h4><p>The company has quickly adapted to the current situation. In early March, we were all working in offices, and no one was really too concerned about what might happen. Two weeks later, everybody was working from home. In 2019 we had started a program to improve the work-life balance of our employees and had already implemented two days a week remote working for 66% of our staff. They had to demonstrate that they had a comfortable area to work in remotely along with certain other working conditions in their homes. When the lockdown was decreed, in just a single weekend we were able to send all our 1,800 employees  home to work remotely. We did not face any significant disruptions in our operations. One of the concerns was the potential impact it might have on productivity, though it has been proven that people work just as well  from their homes as in the office. We have also hosted GFT online events that were attended by almost 1,800 individuals at the same time. COVID-19 has had other consequences for us in Spain. Some of our clients suffered during the pandemic, which has affected us, too. The impact has not been very significant but it has been an unusual year.</p><h4>In 2019, GFT doubled its penetration of the insurance sector, reaching 11%. What is your client portfolio per sector, and are you adding new sectors into your portfolio?</h4><p>We have been breaking into the industrial market too. Fortunately, certain well advanced projects in the automotive sector  have not been canceled, though some have been postponed. In 2020, we won a contract with the financial business of an  automotive company in Spain that wanted to change its entire rental system. We participated in the bidding process and won the project which  was unexpected and adds to our revenue pipeline. Our business is highly focused on cloud computing systems, and closely connected to the Cloud's three most important services — Azure from Microsoft, Google Cloud, and Amazon Web Services, all of whom we partner with. With Azure, we have demonstrated our ability to meet the demands of an insurance project. Our progress in the Industry sector has been more affected by the pandemic as we have not been able to meet companies face to face to demonstrate our services. However, we are working with an IoT platform, Sphinx Open Online, developed by a GFT company in Germany, that allows companies to manage complex information through a dashboard in which they can interact in real time. Some firms in the agriculture sector have also been interested in such platforms. Retail is also a promising sector for us, as it transitions to the online world.</p><h4>You have signed several remarkable agreements in 2020, such as with Thought Machine. What is the strategy behind this agreement, and which others would you highlight?</h4><p>We are not averse to partnering with and promoting third-party brands. We work with a number of companies, and have developed a framework to expedite innovation. We have strategies to approach potential clients together and believe these partnerships are a win-win to gain clients that we have not worked with before.</p><h4>What differentiates GFT from its competitors?</h4><p>We have around 6,000 workers scattered across the globe, from Singapore, Brazil and Canada to Poland, Italy and the USA. We are a medium size company that specializes in financial technology, and that means we are required to have certain standards of reliability, safety and good practice to meet varied compliance requirement. We aim to expand via acquisitions, such as that of German firm in-GmbH, who developed the Sphinx Open Online platform, and with partnerships with larger clients and Cloud providers. One thing that differentiates us is our motto: we are small enough to care about clients, but large enough to fulfil challenging projects anywhere in the world. We work remotely, therefore we can operate anywhere as a single unit. We have offices in Europe and the Americas and have established operations in the Asia-Pacific region with offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, where we have already delivered some very innovative digital banking client projects. This allows Tier 1 type clients to consider our offering in Asia as well. We are also exploring new opportunities in other countries. Some of those projects in other countries are managed from Spain.  </p><h4>What is your main objective for 2021?</h4><p>One of them is to turn Spain into a supplier of advanced maintenance of applications; we want to provide maintenance as a service. We are able to maintain any application that any kind of business might use following strict measures. 2021 will be important for the insurance sector with projects that were postponed in 2020. And 2021 has to be the year the industry sector picks up as well. We expect demand for Sphinx Open Online services to be huge and we have many projects for European companies in the pipeline. And to come up with effective solutions for all these sectors - finance, insurance and industry - we have our Innovation Lab in Barcelona, which we are expanding right now. It serves as a key innovation hub for colleagues and clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does India's current start-up ecosystem, especially with regards to edtech companies, compare to 2010, when Blume Ventures started?</h4><p>In 2010, edtech was practically nonexistent, and no one was really learning online. There was some investment in distribution with a few e-commerce brands. There were also a few edtech companies in terms of providing curriculum and materials; however, there was no one actually offering the kind of edtech we have today, which goes directly to students. In 2010, India did not have high smartphone penetration or cheap bandwidth. In 2010, there were probably 30-40 million people in India using smartphones compared to around 400 million people today. 2016 was a pivotal year, and the story of edtech in India cannot be separated from the story of Jio. Jio made bandwidth really cheap, to the extent that India is likely the biggest consumer of mobile bandwidth today. In 2016, that cheap bandwidth led to the penetration of smartphones. That year, another development happened—unified payments interface (UPI) technology. The Chinese edtech ecosystem took off when three things happened—a smartphone in every pocket, cheaper high-speed internet, and UPI. In India, all three of these factors have come together now. Since 2016, the brands that have taken advantage of this are mobile first, and Unacademy is a great example of this. It started as a YouTube channel and then started putting all its content online through a mobile app. Unacademy started in 2015, and Jio in 2016, and they just took off like a rocket after that. Other young innovative companies like Classplus, one of our portfolio companies, also grew, taking advantage of mobile internet and cheaper bandwidth. There was no edtech sector in 2010, now edtech is the fastest-growing sector in India.</p><h4>What challenges are India's edtech start-ups facing to attract international investment?</h4><p>The exciting story for India now is in what we call “India 2,“ which is a population segment of about 100 million people that have incomes of a tenth of the top 100 million people that make up “India 1.“ These India 2 consumers are rapidly starting to use the internet. These new 100 million consumers are very value conscious; these are the ones Jio has brought into the digital world, and for many of them Facebook, YouTube, and WhatsApp make up the internet. The excitement for international investors is that just as India 1 has been using and consuming edtech products in India, so will the next 100 million. The challenge is that India is not yet a large market. It is an exciting and vibrant market, but not yet a large and deep market—it will take time. However, beyond the market itself, international investors are also excited to come here because there are many companies from India that are doing extremely well globally. For example, 60% of WhiteHat Jr's revenue comes from the US; likewise for Cuemath. Quizzizz was launched in Bengaluru, but is a big hit in the US. There are many such examples of edtech companies starting in India that are doing well abroad. India has a large English-speaking population, with 25-30 million fluent in English and 100 million who are proficient. Therefore, with some modifications, products launched here can be used in the US as well.</p><h4>How does raising funds from international investors play into Blume Ventures' medium-term strategy?</h4><p>Blume Ventures invested in Unacademy in the seed round when it was just starting out. Later, Sequoia Capital and Nexus came in followed by international companies such as Steadview, General Atlantic, and SoftBank. Similarly, with Classplus, another of our breakout hits, RTP Global invested first, followed by a UK-based fund called Alpha Wave Incubation (AWI), a fund of Falcon Edge. There is a great deal of excitement. I must give full credit to BYJU's for being the really big pioneers in the expanding reach of edtech in India. Many international investors have been exposed to BYJU's. The Chan Zuckerberg Foundation, Owl Ventures, Silver Lake, and others have all seen BYJU's, and there is a possibility that more companies will be in invested in today. Every week, I have at least two calls with US investors who all want to find out more about India and explore its potential.</p><h4>What role do you see edtech playing in your future investment portfolio, and how did COVID-19 alter your strategy, if at all?</h4><p>There is an interesting quote by Gaurav Munjal, the founder of Unacademy: “What e-commerce was to China, edtech is to India.“ The Amazon of India will not be an e-commerce company but an edtech company. Chinese e-commerce or food delivery companies are 20 times bigger than the equivalent companies in India; however, India is producing comparable edtech companies. BYJU's is the 2nd highest valued edtech start-up today, just below the Chinese company Zuoyebang. Indians are willing to spend money on education, and we have always believed in that. We are a seed fund. We have a USD100-million fund size and are able to invest in around 25-27 companies. We can only do about four or five education investments, as there are many other attractive opportunities as well. Edtech has been a huge winner of the pandemic, and we accelerated a few conversations thanks to the pandemic. We did five when we might have only done four edtech investments.</p><h4>Blume Ventures has had over 20 exits thus far across start-up sectors. What is your outlook on the exit environment for edtech?</h4><p>We love exits. At the moment, exits are scarce in India because not too many IPOs have taken place. However, they are beginning to take place. There are at least 10 companies interested in going for IPOs in 2021. We will begin to see the first few Indian IPOs soon. The M&amp;A market in India is not as developed as in Europe or North America, and the price one gets when they do an M&amp;A here is not as high. WhiteHat Jr was a glorious exception to that, as it got a great price from BYJU's. However, those instances have been few and far between. An IPO is still the best way for an exit, though we have not had many examples of IPOs. There have only been half a dozen IPOs in this space over the last 10 years.</p><h4>What are your short-term priorities or goals for Blume Ventures?</h4><p>Our focus now is on consolidating and helping investor companies and founders focus on growing. There are many exciting conversations currently underway in the US. Therefore, the idea is to give our start-ups the funds quickly to help them ramp up and make sure we begin our partnerships with US investors in January and February 2021. That is the plan going forward. Blume Ventures' role is to be a gateway for these international investors interested in the edtech sector in India.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your firm dealt with the pandemic and the shift of technology to the center of the conversation in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>As a technology company we have went through a transformation two years ago and we have uplifted our portfolio of services to focus more on managed services, mobility, security, collaboration, cloud and much more. These technologies witnessed a major demand and spike throughout the pandemic and our teams were resilient and were able to support our existing customer base. <br>All enterprises needed urgently to extend their services and applications access to their teams and their end customers and this was our core business for some time now and we were able to support on different levels to ensure business continuity of these businesses.</p><h4>Have you seen a boost in your business?</h4><p>We have witnessed three types of customers since the beginning of this situation. The first type where already in their digital transformation journey and wanted to speed up the process to ensure their businesses will not be affect, and this is where we have seen a major demand and spike. Second, the customers who were heavily affected and have been in the front lines fighting this pandemic like Education, Government and Healthcare. These types of customers shifted budgets and wanted to support the different initiatives they have in the pipeline throughout the pandemic. Lastly are customers who are in the early stage or didn't start the journey wanted to wait and ensure they keep the lights on they shuffled their budgets waiting for things to settle down before having a clear vision on how to proceed.</p><h4>How has the government's response and spending impacted your business in recent months?</h4><p>Definitely there has been an impact. The IT expenditures dropped down where most of the businesses were focusing on the critical projects now on top of others. The Government measures as well were in place to support the economy and ensure the situation fades out with least possible effect on projects and businesses. We have seen the government went on budgets cuts but were keen to continue extending and digitalizing their services to serve the populations at home rather than governmental agencies. On the other hand, we have seen some budgets shifted to the healthcare sector to support with the different initiatives. Our portfolio and partnership with British Telecom positioned us in a good spot with these Government insinuations and efforts where our teams were able to support in several strategic projects.  </p><h4>Does the majority of your current work come from the public sector?</h4><p>It's balanced between both. We used to have 70% of our work coming from the government and 30% from private. We are sensing an interesting move for signing business with the public sectors toward OPEX models, and we are seeing a huge move toward managed services two- or three-years contracts with pay-as-you-go model across many industries and products, whether for videoconferencing solutions or cybersecurity. It is completely managed services, and this is where the many clients are heading to; however, we see it happening at a much quicker pace in the public sector than before.</p><h4>Moving forward, what projects are you interested in working on, and where do these fall in terms of services?</h4><p>We are focusing on three areas of services: global and local connectivity; financial services, cybersecurity; and unified communications, while ensuring the backend from the data center to the cloud infrastructure would be able to support these type of technologies in the best way possible. We have partnered with leader vendors in the market and our team has been certified to implement complex projects across all these technologies. Working with our great partner BT in cybersecurity will help brining a world-class capability in Saudi Arabia in leading financial solutions and cybersecurity. With Digital-shifts we always see cybersecurity as key element to be promoted and compliance in line with NCA &amp; CITC regulations.</p><h4>Which changes that have occurred over the pandemic are permanent and will remain in the market?</h4><p>The first is remote working and giving the flexibility internally for employees to work from home. Companies like us were ready before the pandemic, but the usage has increased with these tools. The pandemic has also helped improving the efficiency and utilization of our resources in general. Thankfully, we see this as the biggest advantage for us internally, and we are trying to reflect the same experience with our clients.</p><h4>Are there attitudes or ambitions that have shifted that will play to your strengths in the future?</h4><p>Yes, as mentioned the ultimate need of digitalization in public and enterprise sectors as well as the continuous updates of regulations regarding data privacy and protection. This will put both cloud and cybersecurity business on the top.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main areas of focus and key developments for Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment since we last spoke at the beginning of this year?</h4><p>The situation in recent months has changed dramatically. Our main priority in recent months has been to serve both the Catalan business community and those foreign multinationals located in Catalonia to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 as much as possible via the implementation of new services, aids and programs, out of Barcelona and through our worldwide network of 40 Foreign Trade and Investment Offices. For example, from the outset, in March, we launched a specific, proactive aftercare service and contacted more than 320 foreign companies located in Catalonia to advise them on areas such as supply problems, logistics or worker mobility. Furthermore, we intensified our contacts with the parent companies of foreign subsidiaries to understand their new needs and the solutions Catalonia could offer.</p><h4>Last year, ACCIÓ attracted 365.2 million euros in foreign investment, 13% more than in 2018. In 2020, the pandemic has affected all sectors and segments of the economy, including FDI. How is ACCIÓ expecting to close this year in terms of investment brought to Catalonia?</h4><p>In recent years, foreign investment attraction by Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment has been increasing. Taking a longer view, in the last five years Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment has attracted 34% more foreign investment volume and 83% more new jobs have been created thanks to investment projects of multinationals in Catalonia. The point here is that the trend is on the rise: Catalonia is consolidating itself with each passing year as one of southern Europe's most dynamic environments in business terms, with recent examples of new investments or expansions of companies such as Bandai Namco, HP, Boehringer Ingelheim, King, Henkel, Nestlé, Adevinta, ABB, and Bayer. Not to mention also attracting the world's most relevant congress in the audio-visual field, Integrated Systems Europe (ISE), which from 2021 will be held in Barcelona along with the MWC. A few weeks ago, we publicly announced, for example, that the number of foreign subsidiaries in Catalonia has grown by 60% since 2013, reaching today's number of 8,900. We are sure that in the midterm this will not change due to COVID-19. We do not foresee a significant number of projects being cancelled or discarded, although it is true that there are foreign investment projects that have been frozen or postponed pending the evolution of the pandemic, as is happening in the rest of Europe and as other investment attraction agencies explain to us. UNCTAD itself foresees that for 2020 global flows of foreign investment will decline between 30% and 40% due to COVID-19.In any case, the characteristics that make Catalonia one of Europe's most attractive locations for multinationals have not changed: a large concentration of foreign companies and startups in a territory with a strong industrial tradition and a powerful technological ecosystem based on scientific centers and world-leading universities. In fact, in Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment we are working with a portfolio of more than 350 open investment projects from companies around the world. And 60% of the leads and projects that are being managed by Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment are greenfield, a sign that Catalonia continues to attract new investment projects.</p><h4>In Catalonia, we see that industrial companies represent the largest proportion of FDI, followed by TIC &amp; digital transformation companies. What other sectors do you see potential in for Catalonia in the midterm?</h4><p>Without a doubt, industrial and technological investments in general are the main priority when it comes to attracting foreign investment. From a sectoral point of view, it is true that Catalonia's assets have made it possible to position ourselves in some fundamental areas, strategically, socially and economically speaking. Thus, health, food, technology (IT &amp; digital transformation) and the automotive industry of the future (i.e., electric, autonomous and connected vehicles) are the sectorial pillars in which we believe that Catalonia plays — and will continue to play — a fundamental role within Europe. Furthermore, we actively work to attract new projects in the chemical sector, e-commerce, logistics and video games, just to mention the main fields.</p><h4>Despite Catalonia attracting EUR23 billion over the last five years, 45% more than the previous five-year period, the difference between Madrid and Catalonia is drastically increasing. According to a study from the LSE, the institutional and political discrepancies are affecting FDI in the region. What is your view on this? </h4><p>I disagree. The stock of foreign investment in Catalonia is higher and undergoing growth. The explanation for this is because the type of foreign investment projects that happen in Madrid and Catalonia, in general terms, have historically been somewhat different. On the one hand, in Madrid we see many investments related to the financial and institutional sector that often are only shareholder changes with limited impact on new productive activities and job creation, although they have a significant impact on statistics; while in Catalonia what stands out are the more industrial and technological projects, both greenfields and new investments by companies already present in our economy that generate new activity and jobs. At Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment we always look at the reasons foreign companies explain to us when they invest in Catalonia. They are various: the market, the existence of a primary client, a required supplier presence, the availability of local and international talent, the existence of know-how in a specific field or technology or the geostrategic position and logistics facilities. And the combination of these factors can be found in Catalonia, which offers a climate of trust and security for investments.Consider, for example, that fDi Markets of the Financial Times group has once again recognized Catalonia as the best region for investment in southern Europe, looking at criteria such as connectivity, business climate, economic potential, and the strategy for attracting foreign investment, as well as the human capital and lifestyle. It is the third time in a row that this ranking — one of the most prestigious internationally and used by multinationals to study future investment projects — places Catalonia in this position.</p><h4>This year, ACCIÓ launched Catalonia Exponential. What are the main highlights of this program? </h4><p>Due to the COVID-19 health crisis, as well as the global accelerated technological change that today's society is undergoing, companies are obliged to generate new value — over and above their daily activity — to become more competitive. Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment, aware of this technological acceleration, launched the Catalonia Exponential initiative in January 2019, a completely organization-transversal initiative, with the aim of accelerating the innovation economy in Catalunya, giving support to companies to transform their business models to deal with external disruptions that threaten them and can be converted into opportunities. The Catalonia Exponential initiative expects to impact more than 500 Catalan companies in the next 3-4 years. To achieve this, various activities are being carried out to raise action such as awareness and awake activities, advisory services, financial support, and direct connection to disruption through our offices located in the most advanced ecosystems in the world (like Silicon Valley, New York, Tel Aviv or Seoul) as well as aligning with European Commission initiatives like the EIC — European Innovation Council. Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment is not only offering those services to companies: more than 40 professionals of Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment from different departments have already been trained with these methodologies to coach companies using them, as well as a contribution to Catalonia Trade &amp; Investment's own transformation, and to walk the talk.</p><h4>At the beginning of this year we discussed about your strategy being focused on digitalization and new ways to innovate, both locally and worldwide. Has this changed due to the pandemic and, if not, how is it progressing? </h4><p>If the role of digitization and technological transformation was already fundamental at the beginning of this year, in a COVID-19 context it has become even more so. That's why, for example, we have doubled the aid to Catalan companies to incorporate technologies such as 3D printing, artificial intelligence, collaborative robotics, big data or 5G. This is the future: incorporating these technologies is synonymous with efficiency, more productivity, more capacity to adapt to changes that cause disruptions such as COVID-19. In short, an increase in the competitive advantages of the company, its productivity and resilience. This support is combined with the consolidation of the Catalonia Exponential programme and the promotion of international innovation by Catalan companies through agreements with leading international entities, such as the National Research Council of Science and Technology (NST), the main R&amp;D entity in South Korea.</p><h4>What is your primary goal for 2021?</h4><p>To build the economy of the coming decades. Apart from having to face the complex situation we are experiencing, the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has accelerated some disruptive processes that had already appeared, such as digitization, technological transformation and the importance of sustainability. We are undoubtedly in one of the most profound times of change since the industrial revolution. Catalonia already had a fundamental role at that time. And we are sure that the ecosystem of companies made up of SMEs, startups, suppliers and multinationals in Catalonia will now play a leading role in overcoming this crisis better prepared and stronger than ever. Combined with a pioneering and class-leading health and biotechnology centre in Europe, the Catalan economy will be able to offer cutting-edge solutions to overcome this global health, economic and social crisis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Cushman &amp; Wakefield evolved since 2018?</h4><p>2019 was our best year ever and the market's best year. Both 2018 and 2019 were both exceptional, with a great deal of activity in all sectors. The office market was booming, and many companies were renting more space. A number of companies, such as BNP Paribas, which is big in Portugal with its security services and back offices, Google, Microsoft, and many French companies, expanded their operations in Portugal. In the retail arena, we saw more selective expansion and many FB businesses, so there was extensive expansion mainly on high street than in shopping centers. However, the excellent shopping centers are still extremely popular with retailers and consumers. The logistics and industrial market was perhaps not quite as buoyant as we would have expected. We have been saying for a number of years that logistics should be an area for growth and that the footprint of logistics parks should expand because of e-commerce, but it is only happening now. Another area that saw a great deal of activity is the non-performing loan (NPL) portfolios from banks. We were and are still processing items from the last crisis. There is a large number of NPLs from Millennium, Caixa, Novo Banco, and Montepio, and many large portfolios are being sold to the more opportunistic investors who buy bulk and then sell piecemeal. As a result of all this, we had the best results in 2018 and 2019 and were the most profitable Cushman &amp; Wakefield company in the world last year.</p><h4>In 2020, Cushman &amp; Wakefield was considered the best real estate consultant worldwide as well as the best national consultant in terms of transactions and real estate appraisals. What sets Cushman apart from its competitors?</h4><p>There are three main global players, and the service offering is extremely similar; however, there is one significant difference in Portugal; one of our competitors does residential, and the other two do not. In terms of the service offering; therefore, it is extremely similar, and we compete head on with the same clients and the same business. What sets us apart is we are clearly the most experienced team. The leadership team in Portugal has been together for 15 years or more, and with one or two exceptions, the top 10 leaders have all been in business for 20 years, and they have all been with Cushman for 10, 15, or even 25 years. I have no doubt we have the most experienced team. Our competitors could argue we are more conservative and older, so we work hard to also bring in younger people from different backgrounds. I was extremely pleased with Euromoney ranking because it is based on votes by clients and peers, so companies cannot influence or manipulate the results. We won for best valuation, best research, best letting and selling, and best agent overall.</p><h4>Despite COVID-19, is it accurate that the real estate sector grew by 36% in 2020 YoY? How would you evaluate the sector's performance?</h4><p>In investment volume, which is the money put into real estate for income-producing real estate, the total figure at the end of August 2020 was up by around 30%. If we go into the details, the majority comprised two massive transactions that are together about EUR1.5 billion, namely the establishment of the Sierra Prime property fund. The Sonae Sierra fund put together four Portuguese assets and two Spanish assets into a fund that was then subscribed by Allianz Real Estate and Elo, a Finnish insurance company. That was EUR800 million all at one go. Then, there was the sale of Lagoas Park to Henderson Park for EUR421 million, which was an interesting transaction because it was in the middle of COVID-19, and it was a new investment in Portugal by a company that had never invested in Portugal before. The other one was a deal signed by a Portuguese consortium buying the Hotel Real chain for over EUR300 million. It is true these deals are outliers, and we predict that the end of the year will not be better than 2018 or 2019—it will likely be about EUR2.8 billion, so down from 2019. The office market is down by about 30% so far. The office market has a longstanding index called the Lisbon Prime Index (LPI), and it is currently 30% down YoY. There is no index for the retail market, though we have our own Cushman &amp; Wakefield index that we monitor closely. It is down 60% YoY, so it is not true there is overall growth in 2020 versus 2019. There are pockets of growth, and there are specific reasons for that. Things are going reasonably well considering there were two months of inactivity and now it is slow. I am relieved by the results so far, as we are around 10% down on last year. 2019 was exceptional, and with the projects in the pipeline, we could get close to last year. I am actually more concerned about 2021.</p><h4>What additional services does Cushman &amp; Wakefield plan to offer in the medium term to diversify the company?</h4><p>We are planning a soft launch for something we call Design &amp; Build, which is closely related to project management. Our project management team manages works for clients. As project managers, we source the architects, construction, furniture, and all others. Design &amp; Build is slightly different in the sense that many clients do not want to go through the process of deciding between three builders, two architects, or others because they just want to move in within three months and want an all-in-one timeframe, price, and design. We launched this as a separate company in October as a new service line.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the rest of the year and 2021?</h4><p>For the rest of 2020, we will close the deals in sight because in general they take fairly long to materialize. We will likely not find any new big deals that are closeable by the end of the year. The next challenge is to create a pipeline for 2021, which we are doing. There were many imminent sales processes in March that subsequently stalled. Some have been back on the market and others not yet. There will likely be a fair amount of product on the market next year. In addition, there will be products from the crisis perhaps in 2022 because companies will go bust so there will be distressed sales. The hotels sector is an obvious one, because unless a company has a great deal of financial muscle, it is not easy to have no income for nine months to a year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1968 by Vicente Berbegal, ACTIU has become the leader in the design, manufacturing, and marketing of office furniture. What have been its main milestones during these 50-plus years?</h4><p>At the beginning, the company was a small workhouse that manufactured furniture on demand. It produced all kinds of furniture and not just office furniture. In the 1980s, the company opened a new business segment with the advent of PCs and computers in the workspace. We started to specialize in office furniture, especially for software development and technology companies. Vicente Berbegal was at the time a pioneer. Starting from 2008, we completely focused on the office space, having a wide portfolio of different equipment for offices. In 2008, the recession hit, and we were severely impacted. We realized we had to invest in branding and look abroad to acquire new clients. We invested in our brand and sought to participate in foreign markets. Actiu has always been manufacturers, and that today has a particular importance at an innovation level. We do not seek to compete on costs; however, we have to remain efficient and also stay close to our clients.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the pandemic on Actiu's operations, and what strategy have you implemented to mitigate it?</h4><p>Our sector experienced a 37% fall in sales, while we personally experienced a 25% contraction of our business. The impact has been extremely significant. We have focused on our business structure in order to sustain our business, which we also did during the 2008 crisis. That allowed us to thrive and overcome the recession. The crisis will eventually pass, and we must prepare ourselves to be ready when the sector picks up. It is important to highlight that we have not carried out any ERTE layoffs. We have made some adjustments to our operations; however, in terms of our staff we have been extremely cautious. We are also accelerating many projects because they might be strategic in the future. As part of this strategy, we are developing products for some segments that might be key in the future. Despite the downturn, the pandemic can be an opportunity, and we have to be ready to remain leaders in our market. Actiu has been extremely strategic during its history, and all its profits have been reinvested into the firm. Financial solvency is one of our main assets, and fortunately we have an exceptionally solvent financial situation.</p><h4>How is Actiu adapting to the new needs in a COVID-19 world, and are you seeking new market niches now that remote work is here to stay?</h4><p>With the arrival of the pandemic, the first thing we did was to provide solutions so that people could work. Protective screens were some of the first products we launched. Second, we looked at how we could support our clients so they could ensure a safe return to work. Not all employees were returning to the workplace at the same time, so we issued guidebooks on how companies could arrange for this safely. One of our new strategies is to optimize working spaces by measuring the humidity, light, and CO2 emissions in order to provide a better understanding of the workspace for our clients. This is a project that we have advanced fairly well and is a disruptor for us. This is a new business segment and is highly aligned with the current needs of offices. We are part of an observatory on remote working, and this can potentially be an opportunity for us because the pandemic has not only generated additional needs but is also a challenge because individuals have to work at home under the same conditions as in offices. We are offering packages to our clients with certain conditions that can be passed on to their employees. We will also expand into the B2C segment, because we see demand and growing interest from that area.</p><h4>Actiu exports to more than 90 markets. Where do you export the most?</h4><p>The majority of our exports go to France, Germany, the UK, and Portugal. These are mature markets but are natural for us. We have a historic tie to Latin American markets and have great relations with the Arab region, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In the last few years, we have strengthened our presence in Africa, and this has been special for us. There, we are focused on particular products such as hospitals and universities. Exports are important for us, though in the coming years we will focus on our natural markets. Spain represents approximately 50% of our revenues, and around 50% comes from abroad. We are targeting a 35%-65% ratio in the coming years; we would like to further expand our operations abroad. In Africa, there are many projects financed by the UN or the EU, and they require safe products and a safe working system, like those that Actiu offers. We have extensive experience in healthcare and education infrastructure. We not only sell furniture and equipment, but also advise our clients by sharing our knowledge and expertise.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2021?</h4><p>We have to advance the digital transformation process. We are currently focused on the new MDF and derivatives manufacturing plant in El Tablero, which has been an investment of over EUR10 million. This has been a highly automated business. Additionally, we are in the process of implementing a new ERP system through SAP. The pandemic has been an excuse to accelerate our digital transformation process. We do not want to lose our hallmark as a family business. Although our MDF and Derivatives plant in El Tablero is already operative, there are some machines that require more time, so it will be fully operational by the end of 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Howden and its operations impacted by COVID-19?</h4><p>It has been a difficult year for all industries and the insurance industry has been no exception. However, despite all the difficulties that have occurred, the insurance industry has maintained strong dynamics. Fortunately, we have not had to reduce our staff. On the contrary, we have needed more support and customer service people because times like this are when the advice of an insurance broker is most valued. Our duty is to understand the needs of people, families, and companies in order to offer them the best advice. Needs are constantly changing in times of a pandemic such as the current one. We have to understand that the most important thing during a pandemic is to be close to customers and communicate our products properly, teaching them what works for them and what coverage is important. The truth is that we have learned many things. I would say that advice in times of crisis is vital and is one of the drivers of insurance brokers. The industry is moving—it is dynamic. In addition, if there was no pandemic, we would still have to be constantly moving because we would have to identify the needs that arise from the situation of the moment. For this reason, we will always be active in all kinds of events.</p><h4>Looking toward the future, which types of insurance products and services will be needed in the Colombian market, and what long-term trends are you noticing? </h4><p>In the long term, there will be many changes in products and services. New business models and new coverage will appear. For example, cyber insurance is perhaps the fastest-growing product globally in the insurance industry. In the long term there are changes because, as the needs of people and industries change, then the sector must adapt. It also has to adapt to new communication and marketing channels because there are more people who will need to purchase insurance and companies that will be more vulnerable. It is therefore necessary for insurance brokers to be able to offer a new range of products and services. Additionally, we must be prepared for all changes. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that we have to think differently because, when an economy faces a situation like this pandemic, the needs of individuals, families, and companies change. Therefore, all the products and services of the insurance sector are also modified. You need to have an open mind. All products have to adapt to the pandemic, but if there is a different pandemic, then they also have to adapt. What's more, they must adapt to climate change, environmental disasters, and new types of families. The most important thing is that the entire portfolio of products and services that must cover a series of needs have to be adapted. The secret is not about making it faster, but about achieving an optimal fit. Companies that adapt will survive in this and all industries. This is one of Howden's pillars; the ability to adapt its format and be able to face change. It has been an extraordinary challenge for the Colombian insurance industry, but it must also be considered that the Colombian industry is strong and has extraordinary companies. The insurance industry has a large number of companies and a tremendously complete portfolio of products. They are, additionally, financially solid companies regardless of whether they are of local or international origin. All the players in the insurance industry have a huge responsibility in this degree, but mainly the insurance brokers because we have to reach out and communicate.</p><h4>How can Howden leverage its global reach and technological capacity to strengthen its position in Colombia?</h4><p>Within its corporate principles, Howden seeks technological tools to adapt to all business practices and specialties. We are a specialized insurance broker and we work a series of industry practices in which each one has a series of highly specialized teams and commercial capabilities. We also seek to innovate in technological tools. Howden looks around the world to differentiate itself from the competition and one of the reasons why it wants to distinguish itself is in the way it works in niches and makes use of technological tools. In Colombia, we are doing the same looking for tools to contribute to corporate segments. For example, for SMEs, which we believe are still neglected in the country by the insurance industry, we are developing a platform that allows them to compare the different insurance companies. Products are typically designed for large corporations, but not for SMEs, thus neglecting the needs of small groups of employees and tighter conditions. These companies, in the event of an accidental or catastrophic event, could suffer irreparable losses and end up exiting the market. We are targeting these types of clients through technological tools. But also, at the individual and family level, there is an enormous challenge to reach them with health, life, and home products. Today, in the wake of the pandemic, people value life and health insurance more. That is why we are targeting them with technologically advanced tools.</p><h4>As the new head of Howden in Colombia, what are your priorities for 2021?</h4><p>My wish, since I became the CEO of this operation in 2019, is to be able to enhance the philosophy of reaching customers through extraordinary commercial techniques, because it incorporates all the capabilities of Howden worldwide, but at the same time offers a personalized and unique service. Our goal is for clients to feel that their service is not generalized, but based on specific practices. We are trying to be less bureaucratic. We want to be more modern and think differently. Howden has some important characteristics because the employees are the largest shareholders of the company. This is a particular and positive model because it allows us as employees to think like entrepreneurs and businessmen. My mandate here in Colombia, from the moment I was appointed, aims to transfer all those values that Howden has to the operations carried out by the company in the country. In this way, clients will feel that they have the best talent, the best team, the best service, and the best practices. This way we will increase our participation. Today we are still a medium-sized broker in Colombia and we do want to have a participation larger than our current market share of 4%. Our intention is to grow and be in the top five.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the history, evolution, and milestones of Thales Alenia Space Spain during these 30 years in which it has become a leader in areas such as space systems for telecommunications, Earth observation, environmental management, exploration, science, and so on?</h4><p>Our company, as many others in the sector, started to develop starting from the late 1980s, when Spain decided to boost its technological development in space. In 1992, Hispasat launched its first satellite, Hispasat 1A, and many companies in the sector had started to develop equipment for that satellite. Thales Alenia Space was one of those companies. However, going back in history, the origins of the company dates back in the 1920s with Standard Electrica, which was the company that manufactured telephones and switching equipment in Spain. Standard Electrica was acquired by Alcatel in 1987, and renamed Alcatel Standard Electrica. One year later, in 1988, Alcatel Espacio (today Thales Alenia Space Spain) was eventually formed as a spinoff of Alcatel in Spain for the space market. We started with a small enthusiastic team around the development of what today is still one of our flagship products: the S-band TT&amp;C transponder. Generation after generation, we managed to make the equipment smaller, lighter and more efficient, which is extremely important in space. Today we have extended our products portfolio and produce around 250 equipment per year in our factory, and we have one of the most advanced plants in the Spanish space sector. Our current portfolio includes radiofrequency equipment as well as digital electronics products. In addition, we have also developed ourselves throughout the value chain, by leading and integrating complex satellite systems and payloads. That challenged us to develop skills that we did not have, which are important in the space industry. By scaling up the value chain, we became responsible for systems engineering, satellite panels integration, and managing contracts with many other companies that supply different equipment. Right now, we are the top European supplier of satellite communication systems. We have been awarded some of the largest and most complex communication systems projects in Europe. One of our main clients is KARI, the South Korean space agency. In 2014 KARI awarded us a contract to develop three complete communication systems for their two new geostationary satellites, GEO-KOMPSAT-2A and 2B. The size of this project was huge, involving the integration of the largest satellite panels ever in Spain and requiring us to manage many subcontractors world-wide and processes to collaborate in the manufacturing of the satellites. I am proud to state that we did such great work that we won the Prize of Excellence. We have also participated in projects involved in planetary exploration, astrophysics and space defense. We delivered the communications system for Euclid, a mission that will explore the “Dark Universe“ and we are now involved in PLATO, a “hunter“ of exoplanets. Recently we have been awarded the communications system for a mission called HERA; a project to defend the Earth from the threat of an asteroid collision. Under this project, Europe will send an observation satellite to an asteroid at 500 millions of km from the Earth to study the effects of the kinetic impact from a previous mission sent by NASA, and understand if we are able to deflect the trajectory of a hazardous asteroid on a collision course with Earth. We are also heavily involved in the development of Europe's next generation of  meteorological satellites, Meteosat Third Generation, operated by EUMETSAT. We are developing the communication transponders and data transmission systems for the six satellites, as well as the instruments' electronics and the on-board data and video processing units, the “brain“ of these instruments. Another recent success has been with NASA, with whom we have signed a contract to develop the communications system for the VIPER lunar rover, a mission that will explore the south pole of the Moon to search for water ice, a key element for future exploration endeavors.</p><h4>What percentage of your sales comes from abroad, and how much do you export?</h4><p>Following our development along the value chain, last year we achieved our long-term goal, which was to become responsible for complete satellite telecommunications payloads. We achieved this crucial milestone in the frame of the Spanish program Spainsat NG for the Spanish operator Hisdesat. This is a defense program that consists of two satellites, and we are the prime contractor for the UHF and Ka-band payloads for both satellites. Before that, most of our activities were focused on export, representing up to 98% of our activities, demonstrating a high level of proficiency and competitiveness. Today, the situation has changed with Spainsat NG, which represents a large volume of activity in the domestic market, so that percentage of exports falls. However, the rest of our activities in equipment and systems remain focused on export markets.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the manufacturing of the Amazonas Nexus satellite from Hispasat, intended for mobility and connectivity?</h4><p>Amazonas Nexus is a high capacity and flexible satellite, which will make it the most efficient satellite in Hispasat's fleet. Thales Alenia Space won a competitive bidding process and the contract was signed at the beginning of 2020. Amazonas Nexus has extremely complex equipment, including data processors and other sophisticated units, being developed in Spain. The satellite telecommunications market has been indeed one of the most successful business areas for our company, and certainly the one in which we have reached a higher position along the value chain.</p><h4>What other business areas are key for the company?</h4><p>In our 32 years of activity we have participated in many missions spanning telecommunications, Earth observation, navigation, exploration, space transportation vehicles and lately we have also entered the launchers domain. From here, we have collaborated in around 600 satellites and we have delivered more than 4,000 pieces of equipment, all of which operating without any issues. Furthermore, our equipment accumulate more than 200 million flight hours without failure. The importance of technology in this sector is huge, because the equipment cannot fail. A single failure can ruin an entire mission, so failures have to be reduced to a minimum. Beyond telecommunications, the other main business area for us is Earth observation.  We have participated in 120 Earth observation satellites. One of our key successes in this domain is the Copernicus program, which is one of the pillars of the European Space Agency and the European Commission, and the most important program ever conceived in the field of Earth observation. We've had an important participation in the Sentinel 1, 2, and 3 missions now in-orbit and will also play an important role in the six new Copernicus missions. In navigation, we have our sights sets on the next Galileo missions for the next generation.</p><h4>How has the pandemic affected your business, and what steps have you taken to mitigate its effects?</h4><p>For us, as for everyone else, COVID-19 has been an unexpected event that has triggered a great deal of uncertainty. We did not know what was going to happen, and, therefore, our first priority was to guarantee the safety of our employees, customers and partners. When the first lockdown measures were announced, all our workers went home. We implemented all the sanitary strategies following the recommendations of the health authorities, and then we ensured the factory-related activities could resume in a safe environment, to ensure the continuity of the activities that are critical for our customers. We took many measures including social distancing, personal protection and smart working from home, and have not reported a single case of COVID-19 infection within our premises.</p><h4>Thales Alenia Space is working on the expansion of its plant in Spain. When will it become fully operational?</h4><p>Among other works, the expansion includes the construction of a large clean room area where the payloads of the Spainsat NG satellites will be integrated, starting by the end of next year. The facility will be ready in the coming weeks. For the first time, the national industry is able to develop a program of this complexity. The previous generation of satellites from Hisdesat, Spainsat  and XTAR-EUR, were both developed by an American company called Space Systems Loral. Right now, the national industry is at a level where we can manage these complex projects. This is a great leap, that has been achieved in a few years. The Spanish satellite operators and the Spanish government are now able to rely on the efficiency of domestic companies to carry out such complex programs.</p><h4>Reaching the European autonomy in space seems closer thanks to the PROMISE project, which is led from Spain by Thales Alenia Space. What are the main characteristics of your involvement on PROMISE?</h4><p>We have, within Spain, an important presence in the domain of digital electronics for space and in particular in the development of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), the “chips“ of the satellites. The PROMISE initiative is a project to attain European independence in space, within the framework of the Horizon 2020 program of the European Commission. The program is 100% European, with partners in France, Greece, Belgium, Portugal and Finland, and we lead it from Spain. PROMISE will create a library in which mixed signal ASICs can be developed in Europe in the future in an easier manner, saving costs and reducing lead times. These chips are the “brains“ of the satellites, and currently the European aerospace industry depends on non-European countries to produce them. It will be possible to subsequently add functions to the library. This is an important step in the next generation of European satellites, particularly in the trend towards satellite miniaturization and mass production for mega-constellations. With a single PROMISE-based ASIC per constellation, around 3,000 units would be delivered in the first five years after the project started. The final results of the project will be presented to end-users and the general public at a workshop scheduled for the second half of 2022.</p><h4>How much do you invest in R&amp;D?</h4><p>For us, investment in new technologies is extremely important. The characteristics of the space sector require strong investment in R&amp;D and top skills. The sector and clients demand more advanced solutions, and we compete with international companies. When we sell a product in Japan, the USA, or South Korea, we are competing with the local industry in those countries. These are top companies within their markets and across the world. Therefore, R&amp;D investment is essential for us to remain competitive. R&amp;D activities represent up to 12% of our sales volume. In addition to our self-funded R&amp;D investment, we have great confidence in the Spanish administration. The space sector is strategic in Spain, and the government has always supported the national industry, which is an strategic sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does edtech represent for your long-term investment strategy in India?</h4><p><strong>WP: </strong>The recent growth in edtech validates our vision that technology has a huge potential to transform how things happen in India at a mass scale. Nearly 10 years ago, when we started Unitus Ventures, it was extremely difficult to find investors in edtech companies. We were one of the few to show confidence in entrepreneurs pursuing what seemed as radical ideas at the time. Introducing technology in a traditionally people-intensive delivery problem that India faces was a big shift. It is exciting to see the growth, be a part of it. It is unfortunate that it was accelerated by a pandemic; however, edtech was already growing well before the pandemic. </p><h4>How would you characterize the current edtech start-up ecosystem?</h4><p><strong>WP: </strong>The one-word answer is hot. There is no question BYJU'S has gotten everyone excited over the last few years so there is a slight gold rush. That is typical of venture capital; it is a boom and bust from a sectoral perspective. Mobility was hot until the pandemic, and now one cannot get a mobility app or company funded because no one wants to invest in something that might get zero revenue because of the next wave of the pandemic. Edtech is the exact opposite. The heat is also because stakeholders are seeing results in terms of easier learning opportunities with increased accessibility and better learning outcomes with deeper engagement. If companies demonstrate great results and solid returns to investors, we will see continued interest in the sector.</p><h4>Within the edtech sector, which areas have the most potential or need for growth?</h4><p><strong>SV: </strong>Individualized learning has immense potential. It has now moved beyond just offering access to videos, syllabus, and learning modules. It is insufficient if companies only provide information to students. The next wave of education is about timeliness and solving the learners' doubts in real-time. This platform agnostic solution can be offered through a WhatsApp group, or any suitable communication platform. Innovations and business models around individualized learning are quite exciting and are set to take edtech to newer heights. When we look at edtech startups we assess whether the businesses fall in the nice-to-have category or the must-have category? The basic difference in these categories is - anything that falls into the former is difficult to monetize, and you will likely get India 1/1+ to pay for it—the 10 million people earning the highest incomes in the country. If you want to target and create impact for the larger mass, you need to be a must-have solution. At the moment, given that youth unemployment is a pressing issue, we are looking at solutions on the skilling and upskilling side of things—a vertical where we expect to see more activity. We continue to look at opportunities that can lead to employment opportunities, such as helping people clear job-related tests, 0-1 skilling for placements in entry level software jobs, staffing for the future and so on.</p><h4>What lessons have you learned or reaffirmed about edtech and its ability to address social needs during this pandemic?</h4><p><strong>WP: </strong>One of the fundamentals that we look for in any business is resilience, and that means solving a problem based on the broad and essential needs of society. Even in a pandemic, parents in the middle income group would want their children to have access to the latest education resources. They will therefore invest their limited funds to help ensure the best for their children. Edtech has demonstrated resilience and is responsive to this particular problem because people are able to move online quickly. For example, Cuemath predominantly had middle-income tutors working out of their living rooms, teaching a small group of children face-to-face after school. The business quickly adapted during the pandemic when the same tutors worked not only with children in their vicinity but also extended services overseas. Cuemath's teachers were able to not only keep their jobs but also increase their incomes by expanding their reach of where they could teach using technology. Edtech sees no boundaries, which is exciting to see.</p><h4>What does the acquisition of LabInApp by BYJU'S and other similar deals mean for Unitus Ventures in the medium term?</h4><p><strong>WP:</strong> LabInApp is an interesting company that is solving a unique problem — which is access to science lab learning. This is essential for low-income or government schools that do not have the heavy resources required to set up and run science labs. The company does this via simulations on digital devices. It was a simple concept that is hard to implement well, but LabInApp did a great job. It was ultimately acquired by BYJU'S, and we are excited for that company. Business is not easy to scale, particularly those targeted at government schools, and it is an extremely long sales cycle. From that perspective, the acquisition was great for LabInApp because it gets their product out to many more people with a direct to consumer model that BYJU'S is doing so well. There will be a lot more consolidation because any company that has cracked the ability to bring products to a mass market will want to acquire other companies and bring those products through their channel and create an umbrella of product / education suite. Such acquisitions will continue to heat up in India.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the immediate steps taken by ENS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p>We have been working on an e-learning program for a number of years. At the end of February 2020, people were talking about getting ready for distance learning. Fortunately, we already had pieces in place that were working for us. One of the most important pieces, which we implemented two years ago, was Microsoft Office 365 accounts for all of our staff and K-12 students. They all have the complete set of tools necessary to go forward, including Teams, PowerPoint, Excel, and Word. We also worked with international computer driving licenses (ICDLs), which became a requirement in 2020. In January 2020, a little over 50% of our staff had licenses, and by the end of the next school year, all of our teaching staff need to have ICDL authorizations. We went a step further to get e-learning coordinators who could work with our teachers who teach K-12 on all campuses. Despite being rather ahead of the curve, the pandemic still changed our landscape considerably. We had been working on a customized learning management system (LMS). Without sufficient time to implement the highly customized solution before the onset of the pandemic, we found workarounds through Seesaw, Edmodo, and other programs that could fit within our powerful student information system. However, technology's toll on younger students is also a critical issue. This is compounded by the limited social interaction and opportunities for social development students, particularly younger ones, are missing. To mitigate this problem, there is support necessary for their emotional wellbeing. We have a full team available, whether it is a counselor, a special education teacher, a regular teacher, or an assistant in the classroom. A second challenging area has been student assessment. We ran our own evaluation of all our programs on all five campuses that included a quality assessment on 78 different indicators available internationally, and within three weeks the Ministry of Education did the same. We found that our processes are working well, but assessment and feedback are significant challenges.</p><h4>How did you end up assessing students, and what lessons were learned from that experience?</h4><p>We learned that assessment is always a difficult part of any program. Using the backwards-by-design approach, we were able to design for the remainder of 2020, including the grade 12 that is testing now, specific targets that we had picked out. We built assessments geared toward that target. The summative assessment is the final target, but the formative ones are smaller that lead up to accomplishing the bigger goal. We had a common format, and lessons were built on the basis of “here is the target, here is the instructional strategy, and here is the formative assessment as we move forward.“ We wrote many papers on this, and our leadership teams on each campus including principals and central office people were meeting with us twice a week. Overall, everyone is picking up the slack and doing the best they can. This experience has been good for us. Because we are an IB school, we have formed alliances with other IB schools in other parts of the world who had started distance learning in January. Having this network has been a great support system as they have been right there with us helping us and talking to us. The same goes for the software companies we use; Seesaw has been extremely helpful. We have provided a great deal of insights for it as well, and it made changes for us. We created collaborative and symbiotic relationships that have been positive. We also went through a virtual IB diploma program audit. They authorized us to provide the diploma program on one of our campuses in Ras Al Khaimah for the diploma program using their own program, one of the first in the world. At the same time, I served on a virtual authorization team for IB in the US, and that was a career program. Those experiences would not have happened otherwise, but we had the opportunity to participate and everyone learned from each other.</p><h4>How has your collaboration with the government been over the past few months?</h4><p>It has been great. One of our deputy superintendents works directly with the Ministry of Education and Abu Dhabi Investment Council (ADIC). The University of Maine's Schools of Policy and International Affairs has been forthright in working with the ministry, as has ADIC. We received a great deal of good advice from these organizations on how to organize our work. The ministry came out with a three-step program to assess how effective we have been and what we need to do differently. They are thinking to the future and about making e-learning and distance learning viable for parents. When students miss school or when parents pull their children out, how do we keep kids up to speed in their education? We have come up with a number of different ways to make sure they are not left behind and have been working with the Ministry of Education in this regard.</p><h4>What is your prediction for the education sector as we all adapt to a new reality and new world?</h4><p>The use of electronic tools, an electronic curriculum, and virtual labs for the sciences needs to be enhanced and made more widely available. We will learn how to use these tools to assist kids in learning when they are ill or unable to attend school for whatever reason. We will be creating podcasts or lessons available to them on the cloud so they can have access. Another piece we will learn is that as adults, we will understand better how to cope with change. A positive effect from this whole situation is realizing how fully patient and understanding my staff has been. They have been following the guidelines to make sure people stay safe and are great role models. We have had challenges, but people have been organized and willing to do what needs to be done to provide a solid program for children and meet their needs. We have also become better at communicating and are trying new things. In the future, if we do get back to some semblance of what education used to be, there will still be opportunities for us to use these skills and things we have learned to move into a different realm and help people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Raytheon Company and United Technologies merged in April, forming one of the world's largest aerospace and defense organizations known as Raytheon Technologies. How will being part of a newly merged Raytheon Technologies impact your business in the UAE?</h4><p>Raytheon Technologies is a global aerospace and defense company that develops and delivers advanced systems and services for our commercial, military and government customers worldwide. We are now 195,000 employees strong across every region of the world. The milestone merger brings the best scientific know-how and talent to our customers and is set to reshape the global aerospace and defense landscape. Our company invests in technology that strengthens performance of customers' commercial and defense platforms for land, sea, air, space and the connections in between. Also, our global perspective with local focus, helps communities and customers prosper and be more secure and resilient. Together, we develop transformative technologies to make air travel safer and more connected, defense systems smarter to keep our customers ahead of threats, and intelligent space technologies to enable progress for humankind. Raytheon Emirates will continue to work with our UAE customers on four business areas: cybersecurity, effectors, air and missile defense, and enabling technology.</p><h4>Emirati Women's Day is Aug. 28. Will you elaborate on the role of women in the defense and security industry, and how Raytheon Emirates is working to promote their participation? </h4><p>Gender parity ensures diversity of thought and is critically important to the future of innovation. Last year, Raytheon Emirates hosted its first Women in Technology panel discussion to celebrate the achievements of women and encourage more young females to pursue technology careers. We will hold the next one virtually in early September.</p><h4>How did Raytheon Emirates react to the pandemic, and what steps did it take to ensure the safety of employees and the community?</h4><p>We closely followed the science and health experts to determine what we were faced with in terms of a health risk to our employees and their families, customers, partners and stakeholders. Very quickly, we followed local guidance in the UAE as well as company guidance to implement remote working and have been doing so since mid-March. Where we would normally have less than 5 percent of our employees working from home, it is now in excess of 40 percent. We had to strike a balance between the health and safety of our workforce and their families and continuing operations for our customers in the UAE and globally. From a company perspective, we are pleased with how everyone pulled together. More importantly, we are pleased with our precautions to protect our employees and their families and integrate that into our community. Moreover, we are producing our own hand sanitizers and PPE and have used some of our U.S. and global factories and technologies to produce protective face masks and ventilators in countries that were hard hit by the virus. We have tried to be a good steward of our company and give back to our community, and. we will continue to support healthcare workers, educational institutions and others.</p><h4>How agile and flexible are you as an organization, and what makes Raytheon Technologies more resilient during this period?</h4><p>The resilience of a company or nation rests on its core values of trust, respect, accountability, collaboration, and innovation which are all interconnected. An immediate and highly relatable example is remote working. I work from home and must be creative and innovative around how I do my business there when I do not necessarily have all the tools and resources that I had available at an office. More importantly, I do not have the benefit of having all my teammates and colleagues in the same physical space. However, we have the creativity, innovation and trust across our leadership, employees and customers that allow us to execute what is critical. Our IT and digital professionals have been working to ensure we have all the available technology to sustain operations. We moved through it quickly, almost seamlessly. Embedded in our organization is the dedication to create those innovative ideas and solutions that continue to protect the health and safety of our employees while maintaining operations.</p><h4>How did the focus on cybersecurity become even more important? What measures were taken by your organization to ensure that safety?</h4><p>The threat continues to evolve, particularly within the cyber landscape, as more organizations and processes move online, and the volume of data expands. This has opened up that environment to all kinds of malicious actors. It has increased risks, though more importantly it has accelerated our defensive measures to protect and secure that data. Raytheon Technologies continues to lead in this space and wants to be a catalyst in that business to protect data. We will never go back to the work environment and workplace we had before COVID-19. As we emerge from this pandemic, we will still see a substantial number of people working from home and continue to have conversations online instead of face-to-face. All that information and technology must be protected and safeguarded., and we continue to look for opportunities and solutions for those customers.</p><h4>How did this crisis push Raytheon Technologies to invest more in R&amp;D?</h4><p>Raytheon Technologies has nearly a century of expertise, including more than 50 years of success in the region. A key part of this success has been our ability to keep pace and align our R&amp;D with relevant upcoming threats and subsequent market effects. No one could predict the pandemic, yet we moved fast by accelerating use of our existing technology and finding new derivatives we could adapt to our business.</p><h4>How have you reprioritized on local human resources?</h4><p>We take great pride in putting several Emiratis in key positions in Raytheon Emirates, especially given the maturity of our business. In line with the idea of forced acceleration, we had to speed up plans to transfer unique skills and resources here and make them available in the UAE. It has been done internally and we are now looking at planning, manpower, skillsets and demand signals on where we can provide and include those resources going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Montepino Logí­stica, founded 20 years ago, holds more than 45% of sustained market share. How would you describe the evolution of Montepino?</h4><h4></h4><p>Our company was founded by my father in Zaragoza in the early 2000s, and we are a real estate developer of industrial and logistic units. We started in the development business, and in 2010, we switched the business model to turnkey projects focused on renting. We seized on the crisis period to enter the Madrid market and consolidate ourselves. During the 2008 economic crisis, there was latent demand for unsatisfied logistics areas, which allowed for the development of the new and effective logistics that exists today. In 2014, we made the first large purchase of land in Spain since the recession hit: a 120,000-sqm plot of land in Corredor del Henares in the city of Torrejon de Ardoz. We were the first to promote a new logistics area since the 2008 crisis, and we sold that asset to a foreign investment fund. In December 2015, we again became the largest buyers of land through the purchase of 250,000sqm in the industrial area municipality of Cabanillas del Campo. There, we developed 170,000sqm of logistic land, rented out 100%, and sold it to Merlin Properties. That was a commercial success. Our next milestone was in 2017, when we established with CBRE a joint venture that is today Montepino. This is a JV between both companies to develop logistic infrastructure. Our entire portfolio is made up of assets developed from scratch. Now, in 2020, our assets are valued at EUR1 billion. We did not meet the goals of the business plan; we in fact surpassed those goals by almost tripling them. This success is due to the fact that we have developed new logistics infrastructure. There is a great deal of existing industrial units for logistics; however, that old infrastructure does not meet the needs of the current logistic sector. Instead, we focus on offering new products tailored to the current needs of the logistics sector.</p><h4>Montepino recently made the final delivery of a new logistics operations center for Luí­s Simíµes in Guadalajara. What does this project mean for the company, and what are its main characteristics?</h4><p>It was a challenge because Luí­s Simíµes required a complex project in which we had to develop three buildings, and it took us more than 2.5 years from start to finish because each building was handed over at different times. Meanwhile, Luí­s Simíµes wanted a completely automated project. The unit of Luí­s Simíµes in Guadalajara is a pilot project in itself. We implemented solutions that did not exist in other buildings in Spain. It has an automated warehouse with a picking area for e-commerce. It has successfully introduced all the different parts of the logistics process in a single industrial unit, all combined with a traditional warehouse. It is an extremely complex project in which we worked constantly alongside with its provider of automation services, because we had to adapt the construction to the pace of the automation. That was why the second building was handed over a year after the first was delivered. Montepino has a technical team of 32 workers doing logistics. The team does not do office buildings or malls, only logistics. Furthermore, our team is in-house, whereas our competitors have it as an outsourced service.</p><h4>What other projects do you have in the pipeline?</h4><p>Our portfolio will increase by 300,000sqm via the 12 projects that we have ongoing. Some two to three years ago, we realized our mix should focus on large-box projects on the outskirts of the largest cities and last-mile ones close to the center, combined with urban distribution centers. We have identified Málaga as one of the cities with latent demand. It has a large population alongside the Costa del Sol beach area, where many developers have developed asset classes. Logistic operators related to e-commerce in Málaga need to supply their products to that population, which is why we went to Málaga to develop a last-mile project that will be 100% commercialized before construction works begin. That has shown us that we can replicate that model in other cities. In Barcelona, we have five last-mile projects ongoing, and we will hand them over in the coming months. We are seeking new operations in Barcelona, as well as Valencia, Alicante, and the main transportation axis.</p><h4>COVID-19 has affected many sectors of the economy. Real estate, due in part to the increase in the food and e-commerce sector, has managed to overcome the crisis. How has the pandemic impacted Montepino?</h4><p>COVID-19 has been a huge challenge, though it has provided us with many growth opportunities. We have accelerated some latent projects that we were to hand over in 2022 and will now be handed over at the end of 2021 in order to meet our clients' needs. COVID-19 had a shock that lasted for some weeks; however, we only stopped operations for the 15 days when the country was in a lockdown. After that, we continued to operate. As a matter of fact, we accelerated our construction projects, and all of them will be handed over before deadline. Meanwhile, in terms of business, COVID-19 has pushed our operations forward. All our buildings are extremely efficient for modern logistics, including automation processes for e-commerce. All our buildings were 100% operational during the pandemic. Modern buildings operate well, because they have adequate spaces for workers and have the capacity to resolve the problems that COVID-19 generated. Meanwhile, the demand for e-commerce has also increased during the pandemic. In six months, we completed all the stages that we were to complete within three years. That is the positive demand for new packaging, materials, and stock. In that regard, the impact has been positive.</p><h4>There has been an increase in urban logistics centers, which allow for last-mile distribution. How much will your last-mile portfolio increase?</h4><p>It is difficult to talk about percentages in last-mile and big-box projects. All the last-mile projects are from 4,000-6,000sqm. The concept of last mile for urban areas has to be understood in the sense of cities like London and Paris. These cities are huge, so the last-mile concept works perfectly for urban areas. However, in Madrid one can reach many different areas in a question of 20 minutes, and while you are driving, you go through many municipalities where industrial spaces exist. Therefore, the penetration of last mile in Spain has yet to occur in those industrial spaces within cities. However, of the 12 projects that we currently have, eight are last mile. Last mile has historically been a challenge for developers. When developing such projects, which are surgery-type, the investment volume is tiny, and large investment funds, including Spanish SOCIMIs, have always ruled them out due to the small sizes of the operations. That has been a competitive advantage for Montepino, because we have done last-mile investments in order to meet the demands of clients. Our total investment in last mile is more than EUR100 million. We see opportunities for big boxes in the outskirts and last-mile projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies did Prosa use to adapt its business model to the “new normal"?</h4><p>The pandemic represents not only a challenge but also an opportunity, and we have definitely worked hard to make the best out of it. We are currently undergoing a technology renewal plan and for the short to mid-term goals, we will continue to invest in digital transformation. We are aware that our people are our most valuable asset, and we have therefore dedicated a great deal of effort to keeping them safe and healthy while they are working from home. For instance, we have provided them with the necessary tools ranging from online training to chairs and headsets so they are able to perform at their best.</p><h4>In what ways does Prosa plan to continue innovating in the payment sector?</h4><p>Prosa has been in the Mexican market for 52 years and has gone through many different circumstances. In a time when the arrival of the digital era is forcing the world into a rather unique scenario, we have to evolve our business and operation models. We have identified trends and tools that we are adopting to help us through this transformation process. Prosa is moving to cloud services technology and a more efficient operation. We are launching a new strategic initiative to introduce PROSA Suite, which will be gradually implemented in the coming years and will allow our clients to connect to PROSA solutions in a matter of hours. We will also explore big data, which is extremely relevant for us because of the large amount of information that we deal with. It is critical that we deliver this information in the form of insights that are valuable to businesses and the decision-making process our clients face on a daily basis. I definitely see Prosa becoming an information company in the short-to-medium term. In addition, we have formed an alliance with Finconnecta to create the first marketplace in Mexico, to provide enterprises with “plug and play" solutions through a secure and reliant API hub. Our plan is to bring fintech companies closer to financial institutions and vice versa in order to strengthen our ecosystem. We are preparing for an open banking environment.</p><h4>When are you planning to complete your technological renovation programs?</h4><p>As a technology company, our renovation programs are never finished; it is an ongoing effort. Instead, we have developed a system for continuous technology upgrades every three to five years. In the next four months, we will invest a significant amount in technology renewal, business continuity, and redundancies. There is a great deal of demand in the market, so we have to be capable of understanding our clients' needs and regulatory changes that may modify the market, and thus focus on creating plug-and-play solutions for our clients. I see Prosa becoming the middleware for clients; it is a natural state for Prosa, where our banks have no further need to invest in developments, by simply adopting the solutions we bring to the market.</p><h4>What are your concerns regarding The Social Dilemma in terms of data?</h4><p>Social networks are useful in many ways; they are effective for communicating with customers and partners. There are compliance and security concerns, so as companies and individuals we must educate ourselves to properly use and capitalize on social media as a productive tool. Prosa has implemented communication strategies focusing on education through digital tools and social media platforms, like the series of Prosa webinars. That was a project where we brought discussion panels around relevant topics for our sector such as open banking, blockchain, and digital transformation to our clients and partners.</p><h4>Why is it important to invest in fintech?</h4><p>The digital era and fintech companies have enabled a deep transition in the market. Today, business models have to be created with a vision of constant upgrading; in addition, we must adapt faster and better over time, because of changing needs, competition, regulations, and technologies. Therefore, it is high priority for a company to be assertive about where business goes and to choose its battles to narrow the gap between the speed new technologies are evolving and the company's internal skill levels. For that reason, Prosa believes open innovation and external strategic partnerships are key initiatives to promote the growth of our capacities and skills and bring tailored value-added solutions to our clients.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves from other competitors?</h4><p>Competition compels companies to innovate, think differently, and add value; it makes us all better. Our main competition today is the use of cash, which represents more than 80% of all transactions. There is a huge opportunity to increase acceptance in Mexico, where despite having 5 million SMEs, we have only 1.3 million POS terminals in the market, most of them concentrated in large cities. Prosa is a significant player when it comes to helping merchants move from unbanked to banked.</p><h4>What is your added value?</h4><p>Prosa is the largest switch in Mexico and the third largest in Latin America. A payment switch is a foundational element for all modern payment ecosystems. We enable communication between issuers and acquirers to process payments in the most efficient way possible and offer the best user journey. In addition, we offer our clients complementary and innovative solutions to create a cost-effective payment framework management. Today, we already have a presence outside of Mexico; we provide our services in five countries mainly located in Central and South America. Once we make significant progress toward our technology renewal plans, I see an opportunity to keep diversifying geographically.</p><h4>What are the main priorities and objectives for Carnet in 2021?</h4><p>The main priorities for Carnet in 2021 are to keep growing the business with our clients, keep improving our product offerings and pricing, and go international.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the difference between Comex and Comex Professional Division?</h4><p>We serve many markets and customers. Through the 4,700 Comex stores, we serve mainly the DIY sector, individuals, carpenters, and locksmiths. In Comex, one can find an entire portfolio of coatings, including waterproofing, wood coating, and industrial products. In the Professional Division, we visit our customers with over 1,000 sales reps in the country who work with our concessioners. We work with sectors during the customers' entire journey, from specification and operation of the projects to after the application, and everything between these steps. We work with B2B commercial in five main sectors: new construction for housing and corporate, government, and the entire commercial and hospitality sectors. In B2B industrial, we have basic infrastructure in Mexico, which is oil and gas, energy, communications, and everything related to private and government companies generating all the resources within the country. Another one is the entire manufacturing sector for every category in the country as well as the steel manufacturing sector. We are one of the most recognized brands in the country since we are the third-largest retail chain. We remain committed to the community and have donated to the health sector more than 1.5 million masks and thousands of liters of sanitizing and antibacterial gel that we manufacture in our facilities produced in line with WHO recommendations. This is not a one-part job, as government, private companies, and individuals all need to play a part to recover quickly and get through this difficult situation.</p><h4>What new opportunities have emerged in 2020?</h4><p>We foresee heavy investment in automotive, aerospace, electronics, textiles, health, rail, appliances, marine, transportation, energy, oil and gas, steel manufacturing, and many other sectors due to COVID-19. This represents a significant opportunity for asset protection in both construction and maintenance for the investment already in place in the country. Application services are one of the main opportunities we can provide to the Mexican market. Another important opportunity in the market is working on different product attributes that help the construction industry and make their jobs easier. We are creating environmentally friendly solutions that are water based, have low VOC content, and are lead free, insulation systems to reduce energy consumption, and water and fireproof coatings that meet LEED certification to reduce one's carbon footprint. Another opportunity for us is the rapid and significant growth of e-commerce. An omnichannel experience will be necessary for many companies, including ourselves, and we need to adapt and create integral solutions based on customers' needs, with immediate and technical and commercial information in real time with payment methods and direct onsite delivery.</p><h4>What is your strategy to ensure the professional division grows in the coming months</h4><p>Most of the strategy is to remain close to our customers, not only physically but also in the digital aspect, as we need to accelerate our omnichannel experience. We are currently working on an app where our professional customers will be able to find out our portfolio of solutions and services from their phones. The second priority is to be with them in terms of technical advice. We need to provide fast, economic, and efficient solutions to make our customers' jobs and lives easier. In terms of credit, we help with commercial and pricing strategies, as the economy will be affected, and this will be a differentiator from the ones who do not work to assist their customers. We will have a clear promotion strategy for the rest of 4Q2020 and will launch innovations for specific products, such as fast-dry enamel. We launched an antibacterial paint in 2Q2020 that was initially due for 4Q2020 and was accelerated. The paint eliminates 99.9% of the four-most com-mon bacteria and viruses in the country. We also provide safety equipment to take these solutions to hotels, corporate buildings, and small businesses in order to create safe working environments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways have Zurich's operations in Colombia adapted to the pandemic, and what opportunities came with 2020?</h4><p>The industry has demonstrated it was prepared for remote work, though this is not enough. Customers expect more, and the time has come for us to step up. We must be able to make ourselves more present, closer, and tangible. We must also offer our clients and intermediaries new products, tools, and communication channels to make our business more efficient. It is not just about being digital, but also about the way we are seeing the future, which is already here. We have consolidated our value proposition for the corporate market and decided to step ahead and enter the retail and affinity markets with an innovative and digital value proposition. There are tools, services, and products that makes us different. We have to deliver new experiences and compete with the future.</p><h4>To what extent has the pandemic made Colombians recognize the necessity of being protected and insured?</h4><p>Insurance penetration in Colombia, as in the region, is too low, measuring 2.9% of GDP. The insurance gap is the result of several causes such as culture, per capita income, financial inclusion, education, and accessibility to products. It affects society, the economy, and government. Each time natural disasters occur, requests for insurance protection grow, though only for a short period of time. The current crisis could be different. Protection interest for life and health have shown a positive trend, though the big question is how it will evolve in the coming months. I hope people realize the necessity of being protected and insured.</p><h4>This year has forced many businesses to accelerate a digital switch. How do you assess this digital development?</h4><p>The insurance sector is due for a digital transformation. The pandemic and lockdowns have made the switch even more urgent. We have a big responsibility with our agents and agencies, as well as with clients, and we have to support and walk this digitization path with them in order to grow in knowledge, experience and capabilities together. This is the only way to be successful in this journey.</p><h4>Zurich recently launched two digital products, Zurich Mov and Zurich Cree. What do these products provide for customers?</h4><p>Zurich Mov is an automobile product, and Zurich Cree is a Pyme product. These products provide our intermediaries and customers with an end-to-end digital solution, from the quotation process to the claims payment. Furthermore, in the case of Zurich Mov, we are delivering innovation to the market. This is a mobility solution, designed for the individual more than for the vehicle. It means the product also covers the general liability and personal accidents when the insured commutes by bicycle, scooter, or public transport service. It can even include bicycles and/or scooters if needed. It is a real tailor-made, modular offering. Customers can purchase the insurance on a “first lose“ basis for certain coverages. Other than that, and based on the Zurich principles, we are breaking paradigms. We decided not to cover the damages of the insured vehicle if the individual insured is driving under the effects of drugs or alcohol, though we do cover third-party damages. This is in line with our corporate social responsibility. We launched this product in May 2020, when no other insurance company had a similar offering for a motor product yet. We must be able to deliver digitization, innovation, new value propositions, and new experiences for customers and intermediaries. Zurich is spurring the Colombian insurance market to evolve.</p><h4>What is the potential for the development of insurtech solutions in Colombia?</h4><p>Insurtechs have been part of the answer, and it is clear we need to support them. We are an open-minded industry and recognize opportunities everywhere.</p><h4>With the acceleration of digitalization, cybersecurity is becoming even-more important. What services does Zurich offer to protect against cyber threats?</h4><p>Zurich has always led innovation in the sector. The company is recognized as a specialized insurer for financial lines and a product designer with own capacities for those lines of businesses. Cyber is no exception. In 2020, Zurich launched Zurich Cyber Solution, a risk management solution and a risk prevention tool. It is not just a new product, but a way to become closer to clients and support them through services with added value.</p><h4>How do you assess the state of the insurance sector in Colombia, and what is Zurich's role within it?</h4><p>Colombia is a technical and developed industry; it is known across the region for the high quality of its professionals, the presence of the main international players, and a large and professional domestic ecosystem. It is a competitive and solid market. The entire sector must work against the low insurance penetration by providing new solutions and products. The industry should also continue to work on digitalization and support intermediaries in this path, delivering innovation in products, solutions, and tools will sustain trusted relationships with customers. Zurich's role is contributing as a relevant actor within the market.</p><h4>How important is Colombia to Zurich's portfolio?</h4><p>This is one of my biggest challenges. Zurich Colombia was a greenfield operation that started five years ago. Today, the company requires a different size. Being a USD84-million (GWP) insurance company in 2020, we have two main objectives: becoming a USD250 million (GWP) insurance company in 2024 and being one of the top five companies in Colombia by preference for quality of services and confidence among our clients, brokers, and agents. Colombia is extremely important within Zurich's strategy for the region. We are the second-largest international insurance company in LatAm, and our plan is to consolidate and strengthen this position.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on your recent growth trajectory and relationship with the Saudi Telecom Company (STC)?</h4><p>Intigral is stc's fully owned media and entertainment arm that started off in 2009 as a digital media solutions provider providing mobile-related services and IPTV services for stc. With internet bandwidths and delivery having improved significantly, we have moved to an OTT delivery over the internet, similar to Netflix, called Jawwy TV, a premium entertainment service. Intigral is working as a super aggregator offering a blend of three things: live streaming of more than 240 media channels including free-to-air channels as well as encrypted channels; video-on-demand content from several content providers with more than 23,000 Arabic and Western content movies and series; and original VOD productions that are commissioned and executed in the Kingdom or elsewhere. We are investing significantly in those productions and release around one original production per month, mainly revolving around three themes: women empowerment in Saudi Arabia; everything to do with Saudi landscapes and tourism; and inspiring youth to go above and beyond. One example was a recent original production based on partnering with the KSA karate champion. Jawwy TV is delivered via two vehicles—Jawwy TV App and Jawwy TV Home, a setup box provided by stc. There are numerous features common to both including parental controls, TV guides, pause-and-rewind functions, and catch up for the last week. In 2017, stc decided to venture into three main areas for growth: media and advertising; digital financial services, where it launched stc Pay in 2018; and ICT services for businesses and government. For stc, TV services are a tool to differentiate both its fixed and mobile services, and it is also a route for stc to serve customers beyond its three markets Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain. Since Jawwy TV is an OTT service delivered over the internet, we can venture into other markets in the MENA region, and we have an aggressive expansion plan that we will start to execute in 4Q2020.</p><h4>What patterns have you seen as a result of the lockdown, and what has this meant in terms of revenue?</h4><p>Despite the challenges that the pandemic has presented around the globe, opportunities have presented themselves for global pay TV service providers. Consumption of OTT entertainment, news, and sports content in 2Q2020 surged by around 40% according to global research institutes. Jawwy TV witnessed an increase in user rates from existing and new customers, especially with the stay-at-home advice from the Saudi government. Throughout 3Q2020, we saw an increase of around 147% for Jawwy TV App and a significant increase in Jawwy TV Home usage year-on-year. Also, during the same period we recorded a 57% increase in subscribers year-on-year, which we attribute not only to the pandemic but also to new features such as the release of new original productions as well as the promotion of new content. Most importantly, this period has proven that we are on the right track with our vision of matching all content needs through one platform and one subscription, curating aggregated content via partnerships with more than 30 global and regional networks. During this period, we have also supported the government's e-learning programs by offering to broadcast the national educational channels.</p><h4>How does your partnership with OSN fit into your strategy?</h4><p>Our vision is to become the leading media and entertainment provider in the country and the wider MENA region, so we are always looking for new content opportunities to enhance our expanding portfolio to meet the needs of multicultural users of all ages in our region. In this context, our partnership with OSN is definitely one of our valued assets. OSN Ultimate Movies package and Ultimate Entertainment package have been available on Jawwy TV Home since its inception, along with a number of OSN channels as part of the basic subscription. Under our new agreement with OSN, we are going two steps further and will include OSN Mix in the basic package of Jawwy TV Home as well as a number of channels such as Disney XD, Nicktoons, Discovery HD, and the ARP channels, which are newly available on Jawwy TV within the entertainment package. In addition to OSN, we have strategic partnerships with Starzplay, Fox, NBC, The Cartoon Network, and others to ensure the continuity of the exceptional content choices that cater to the entire family. Jawwy TV has also been adding value to the regional video entertainment industry through new original content at the rate of around one new title per month, which confirms our commitment to novelty and to delivering an unparalleled viewing experience.</p><h4>Are you chasing additional purchases in the platform or overall subscription numbers?</h4><p>Video OTT is truly a land grab market, and the global players are currently valued not on the basis of their revenues or profit generated but the number of subscribers. We are in the same game, so for many this is a new service, and our focus is on increasing the active base and, over time, increasing our average revenue per user through those additional add-ons.</p><h4>What performance do you expect over the coming year?</h4><p>The MENA OTT market is anticipated to continue to see growth in VOD subscription, as opposed to traditional pay TV services, which are predicted to decline over time. There is some substitution going on catering to the different ways of consumption from home, though it is paramount to be able to consume content wherever one is through OTT services. We are present in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain, the three markets where stc has its own fixed and mobile networks, and we are gradually deploying the service to other MENA markets either in cooperation with local telecom operators or in a direct-to-consumer model, where consumers pay via credit card as opposed to paying through telecom subscriptions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your digital transformation effort fared during and after the pandemic?</h4><p>We were fortunate to start our digital transformation journey in early 2017. We are starting to see real benefits of the transformation that we have undertaken. 83% of our customers' accounts were registered online as we entered the crisis, and 65% of our customers have been active users of our electronic channels. We have seen more than 50% growth in the usage of mobile application transactions and an upsurge in our remittance business, which is primarily driven by expats and foreign workers in the country. We have migrated almost 35% of that business to digital channels. The pandemic triggered the use of these channels even more. If you are migrating customers to digital channels, then you require 24/7 aftersales services, which consequently resulted in tremendous growth in our social media and call center coverage as well. We launched a multi-language call center that speaks eight languages to cater to   customers of various nationalities. We started all of these before the pandemic, but the pandemic accelerated it. Our customer experience delivery is excellent. The investments we made in infrastructure, advanced digital technology and communication capabilities helped ensure a smooth transition. We are reaping the benefits of migrating our business to digital, strengthening our brand and allowing us to capture more market share.</p><h4>Can you break down your 2Q2020 results and explain how you were able to maintain your margins during the lockdown?</h4><p>There are two elements. One is the fee income, which was adversely impacted a by the pandemic. There were initiatives taken by the government and the central bank to waive fees on certain transactions through electronic channels, which lowered our fee income. However, we have been gaining market share and have built a strong portfolio. Our income has been increasing driven by the rising yields on our investments, while our net interest margin is still excellent. We managed to capture some opportunities during the pandemic since there were some market dislocations. We also sustained our growth in the housing sector and are currently number four or five in terms of housing market share. This allowed us to maintain our level of income, albeit lower fee income. Crucially, we also rationalized some expenses, as one must be extremely efficient during tough periods, and that has helped us as well. Our previous investments in technology underpinned our strategy to streamline our operations to maximize efficiency.</p><h4>Can you outline the performance of the housing sector for the bank and the impact of the pandemic?</h4><p>We continue to see opportunities in the housing sector. Even with the VAT increasing from 5% to 15%, the government is refunding the VAT for first-time homeowners up to a certain threshold. There is a huge untapped market for first homes in the Kingdom. This has helped us maintain the same level of growth, even as the market for homes above SAR1 million has slowed down slightly. Our focus has always been on first home buyers, as it is more stable and secure compared to second or third home buyers, which are highly leveraged and subject to volatility.</p><h4>What other sectors is the bank seeing growth in today?</h4><p>Our corporate banking is focusing on niche transactions, and we have been growing there. There is also the SME sector, which is at the forefront of Vision 2030.  The restructuring of SME grants has helped increase the appetite of banks to look at the SME sector. Our focus for SMEs has been to design programs for certain business activities instead of having to look at deal by deal or transaction by transaction since it will be operationally intensive. We have been focusing on designing special programs for certain business activities and automating the process. We have done this for Hajj and Umrah, for example, which is performed every year. There are SMEs active in this space, and we have done special programs for them that allowed us to capture 70% of this business. SMEs are a self-funded portfolio, because if you have a pool of say 10,000 SMEs operating with you, and you provide them credit, it will be self-sustaining as these accounts will fund each other. Moreover, if you afford SMEs with the technology and services they need, they will maintain their accounts with you, and in the process  allow you to provide other SMEs the short-term finance they require. We see plenty of opportunities here.</p><h4>Where do you see the bank in the coming two years?</h4><p>Over the last period, we have been extremely conservative in terms of our portfolio approach. We have built our coverage ratio to the point where we are second highest, and our NPLs are still low. We have also been conservative to cushion ourselves in difficult times, so I have no concerns over the health of our portfolio. Our investments in people, processes, technology, and governance over the past few years are showing their benefits. The machinery now works extremely well.  We now need to focus more on sales and marketing to gain market share, as the bank fully capitalizes on these investments. Today, we are the fifth largest in terms of branch network, and we have a remittance business that some other banks do not have. All these investments will definitely play a significant role in driving the business. I am extremely optimistic that we will continue to post double-digit growth over the coming few years, even during challenging times. We are getting high level of satisfaction in terms of how stakeholders perceive the bank, and that will definitely boost growth going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The payments industry has seen a unique set of impacts from the pandemic. How have you reacted?</h4><p>The payments industry never sleeps. To provide service 24/7, you need to make sure your staff can work remotely from wherever they are located. American Express Saudi Arabia had the legacy infrastructure for remote access and we were able to extend this facility to all staff from the start of the pandemic. Our strategy for COVID-19 was designed around four stages—lockdown, transition, recovery and the growth stage. For the lockdown stage, we looked at the payment services customers needed during a total lockdown. They would be ordering essentials online and driving to neighboring grocery stores and pharmacies. Traditional cash users started moving to cards and other electronic payment methods. Contactless payments started to become important for the customer. The central bank reacted fast and increased the contactless limit from SAR100 to SAR300 per transaction, so people did not have to touch payment machines when entering their PINs to make small payments. Subsequently, the first behavioral shift of paying for even a small item with a credit card or phone started. The second was the increased use of credit cards for local transactions in Saudi Arabia. Previously, many only used credit cards when they were overseas and still used cash or debit cards at home. Third, we noticed our ATM usage falling because people were using less cash and more electronic/card payment methods. All card and electronic payments saw a massive growth in transaction numbers locally. During the transition phase, consumers were buying home entertainment units such as televisions, sound systems and work from home essentials such as computers, large monitors etc. Home and garden improvement products became popular. In the recovery stage people started to travel locally. This saw people who never considered a local holiday before going on staycations. Local tourism became more popular, for example going fishing and diving in Jeddah. That is the phase we are in now—people are changing their lifestyles. The next stage is when people can travel internationally, though that is some time away once a vaccine is found.</p><h4>What has happened to American Express Saudi Arabia's revenue in this period?</h4><p>Our revenues have suffered like most companies who depend on travel and consumer spend. A large part of our revenue stream comes from international travel and corporate travel. Thus, while we have suffered from a revenue perspective as a result of COVID-19, we have been able to re-invent ourselves as an everyday card for local spend in the Kingdom. We have made our platform more efficient and automated a large part of our processing. Overall, COVID-19 has hurt the credit card industry in the short term but accelerated the move away from cash, an exercise that would have required a substantial marketing investment and time. In our transition to being an everyday card, we have increased our acceptance rate three fold. Our aim is to be close to parity in terms of merchant acceptance with other card schemes in Saudi Arabia. We are also incentivizing customers who use their American Express card at selected supermarkets and online merchants so that their everyday spend is captured.</p><h4>What are the implications and strategy when it comes to American Express' corporate card business?</h4><p>Now, we see a great deal of B2B payments being made by corporate cards. People are paying their vendors using a corporate card, which is another interesting area. We see more corporate cards being used instead of a cash per diem for corporate spending.</p><h4>Is American Express Saudi Arabia's strategy at the moment to expand your mass market customer segment?</h4><p>The mass market customer has to be acquired digitally, so we have launched an e-apply platform where a prospect can apply for a credit card, upload their documents, and get instant approval fully online. We launched a campaign that will target various audiences for membership. This will enhance and broaden the reach of American Express from the limited reach of the traditional F2F sales.</p><h4>What do you see for American Express' business in Saudi Arabia for the next year as the situation evolves pre-vaccine?</h4><p>The worst is behind us, and we expect to see a gradual recovery. During the recovery, we will ensure that American Express' platforms are robust to support our digital offering. We need to make sure we have the right partnerships to support the change in our customer behavior trends. As we are a closed loop card system, we are the issuer, network and acquirer retaining the transaction with us at all times, unlike other card schemes where the transaction is handed over to various other entities. From a safety and security angle, a closed loop network is always a better option for the customer.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do health and biotechnology factor into future plans for NEOM?</h4><p>NEOM will be the first major development built from the start in the age of digital technology, and so technology will contribute to the development and functioning of NEOM in every way theoretically possible today, and in ways not yet even imagined. Everyone in NEOM is welcomed and encouraged to think about how technology can be used to further their goals, because we will have the technological infrastructure required to make these ambitious aims a reality. In the area of health, this means looking at applications in biotechnology. And health is a priority for NEOM, not only because of the exciting opportunities lying at the crossroads of health and technology, but because we aim to be the most livable city in the world, and this won't be possible unless we make the health and wellbeing of NEOM citizens a priority. NEOM will be healthy by design. We are already undertaking numerous projects focusing on health, wellbeing, and biotech longevity with the aspiration of adding 10 years to the lives of citizens across the MENA region. Addressing chronic  diseases like diabetes and obesity is an important near-term aim, and one especially relevant to Saudi Arabia where 20% of the population has similar problems. NEOM will counter this by making healthy ways of living where we invest in healthy people the standard, rather than simply focusing on healthcare and treating those who area already sick.</p><h4>How is NEOM adapting to take advantage of increased digitalization over the coming years?</h4><p>Digital-first systems are in NEOM's DNA, and our health and wellbeing systems are no exception. At NEOM, our digital backbone means that we will be using and encouraging advances in health-tech wherever they are most useful and feasible. From administration, handling records and analyzes efficiently, to prevention using wearables and AI-supported diagnostics, all the way to digital twinning which we intend to implement as widely as possible across NEOM. The COVID-19 pandemic has actually accelerated many of the plans we had for the next two to three years, such as virtual telemedicine and virtual care, which have become extremely important. We have talked many times about creating a system where people's heath starts at home, and only progresses to hospitals when there is a true need. At home, one can access virtual care not only from physicians but also mental coaches, life coaches, and nutritionists. In NEOM we have implemented emotional mental health services all accessible from home. Over the last several months, people have adapted to virtual care out of necessity, but it is a welcome shift and a trajectory we absolutely want to encourage. Moreover, at NEOM we are more than prepared for this shift, and for the many changes digitalization will bring in the future.</p><h4>What lessons have you taken from COVID-19, and how has that created an aspect of learning and changed your direction?</h4><p>If anything, it has actually validated our strategy, and provided useful learnings for the future. The pandemic has validated two aspects of our strategy in particular: the need for virtual care, and the importance of and demand for mental health care, not just physical care. Mental health is more important now than ever as lockdown fatigue and uncertainty about the future leave people feeling anxious and alone. A core aspect of our strategy is the principle that there are five dimensions of health and wellbeing: mental, physical, virtual, social, and emotional. We want to be able to provide all NEOM residents and visitors the tools to fulfill these five elements of wellbeing. I am extremely proud of the opportunities being extended to women here and have had opportunities that I would not have had before, as silos are being broken, and everything is becoming integrated. I have an opportunity to showcase a caring, empathetic, progressive strategy that caters to the health and wellbeing of all elements of our people, and that demonstrates effective leadership. For me, there have been multiple learnings in terms of health, leadership, and helping people to be completely productive at work. It has been an opportunity, as every calamity brings opportunities. It is comforting to know that what we have designed so far and learned from all the benchmarking and travelling around the world is bearing fruit - that our plan is working and will continue to work well into the future.</p><h4>What key trends will drive the development of NEOM going forward?</h4><p>Technology will always be at the core of what we do, but as a facilitator - a means to an end- not the end in itself. NEOM's ambition to be the most liveable city in the world and a model for 21st century and beyond living will drive our development, and to achieve this we must remain agile and adaptive to the many changes sure to affect us in the coming years. The most important skill going forward will be agility and our ability to immediately adjust to anything that comes our way, as we have with COVID-19. Agility has been incredibly important for us this year as business never stops, and we have had to find ways to not only continue, but to continuously improve. If we remain agile we will find ourselves adopting many best practices from across the world, regularly adjusting the way we do things to introduce incremental improvements, and developing new ideas and practices through transformation and integration. Adaptability is so important in the world right now, and the key to success for NEOM.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact have you seen from the pandemic in terms of volumes and types of transactions?</h4><p>The impact has been enormous. The Kingdom is far above the government's target of 28% cashless transactions by 2020. We saw interesting trends during the lockdown; some merchants completely closed down, while others, especially food and home deliveries, tripled their sales. There were also trends in home furniture tied to people wanting to relax in their homes. After a while, we started seeing a growing demand for small office furniture such as desks, chairs, and laptops. A month or so after the lockdown, we started to see female categories, such as makeup, perfumes, and beauty products growing. Hyperpay saw a truly huge spike during the lockdown; more than tripling our numbers. We are one of the few companies growing faster during COVID-19. The impact was positive for Hyperpay. Our official target was 200% growth in 2020 compared to 2019, but now we will reach more than 200% in 2020.</p><h4>Could you have achieved 200% growth without the pandemic?</h4><p>Yes, we could have because we were doing over 200% growth in the volume of transactions in the past four years. In July, when things opened up, the number of transactions slightly slowed down, but was still relatively higher than before the pandemic. Of our new customers, I would say a minimum of 30-40% will continue to use online transactions even when other options return. The impact was positive, and it is definitely in line with the strategy of the Kingdom to digitalize everything.</p><h4>As a result of the pandemic, what have you seen in terms of the differences between the number of transactions and overall revenues?</h4><p>The average expenditure per user fell, because certain sectors came to a complete halt, such as entertainment, airlines, travel, and so on. Usually, those sectors make big volumes, with an average of between SAR1,000 and SAR1,500 per transaction. The growth came mainly from delivery apps with an average transaction of SAR100-120. There is definitely a gap between the average transactions before and after COVID. Although we saw an increase in the number of transactions and in volume, in terms of revenue we saw a small drop. We predict to end up with 150-170% growth in revenue between 2019 and 2020. Our plan was to hit 220-230%.</p><h4>Will the current behavioral changes persist in the future?</h4><p>The future is bright for fintech, especially the payment sector. During the pandemic, we had two challenges: providing our current clients with support to keep their businesses growing; and the huge demand from clients for a payment gateway immediately. Fortunately, Hyperpay was prepared with a few options, and one of them is an invoicing system. It is an independent product that does not require an e-commerce website or integration, so it was easy for us to take around 600 merchants live in a month and a half. It was still a challenge; our team was working 17 hours a day, seven days a week just to cover this demand. We had to adjust many things internally just to respond to all the demand, but it depends on current clients, and we added more clients during the pandemic. Some of them saw good traffic, mainly for well-known brands that are already in the market because they closed their physical stores and depended completely on online transactions. In short, there will be a lasting change in the sector, and people will not go back to using cash as they did in the past.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your partnership strategy?</h4><p>From the beginning, we had a mission to partner with everyone. Today, Hyperpay is the only payment gateway with access to all banks in KSA. We work with all 11 banks in Saudi Arabia, this gives our clients and merchants the ability to choose the bank they prefer to deal with. With regard to STC Pay, we consider them a partner, and this partnership is growing. You will see increasing collaboration between STC Pay and Hyperpay in the near future.</p><h4>What do you see in terms of recovery in the coming year?</h4><p>We have learned a lot in this first stage, and we invested in our product line, so we have many new products that will serve all the categories in the coming year. Whatever happens, we are ready for all kinds of merchants and transactions to be covered by Hyperpay immediately. We see a bright future, no matter what.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Health has been at the centre of Saudi Arabia's reform agenda for the past five years. How has Roche Diagnostics Saudi Arabia played a role in this process?</h4><p>Roche Diagnostics Saudi Arabia is a strong partner of Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Health and the public sector. We have worked hand in hand with the Saudi healthcare sector and supported in many different areas. Roche works in Saudi under three pillars—quality, innovation, and development. We have always been keen to deliver only quality products with either or both CE marks/FDA approval. We provide state-of-the-art technology and offer total lab automation (TLA) - a unique setup that relieves laboratory staff of repetitive tasks, enabling hospitals and clinics to better utilize their employees' time. Roche has worked hard in terms of development in line with the Saudisation plan as we successfully reached around 26% Saudisation at Roche, with this workforce proving itself to be effective and efficient. We have Saudi personnel in various departments and roles including engineers and application specialists. We also strive to achieve women's inclusion and empowerment in the workforce - which is one of my specific goals leading the Saudi organization - and considered a foundation of our diverse culture at Roche. With people being our most valuable resource, we are keen to develop both our employees and our partners to ultimately serve patients.</p><h4>In 2018, Roche obtained a SAGIA license for a joint venture with your distributor in Saudi. What were the specifics of that deal and the reasoning behind it?</h4><p>We are focused on implementing Vision 2030 and targeting all medical companies that operate in Saudi Arabia. In November 2018, we went direct in the country with our operations. This means we have immediate access to patients and decision-makers through our joint venture partner, Farouk, Maamoun Tamer &amp; Co. We have also invested directly in our healthcare division. This will reflect positively on our human resources, as we will be able to attract new talent by having an on-the-ground presence in Saudi Arabia. Having a direct presence here also allows us to make better investment decisions in terms of our diagnostics products.</p><h4>How has Roche participated in Saudi's COVID-19 response efforts through its diagnostic products?</h4><p>At the outset, everything was unchartered territory, but Roche was quick to adapt to a new way of working. For example, we were one of the first companies in Saudi Arabia to stop face-to-face meetings and have our staff work from home. We have over 400 regional employees and were extremely proactive in giving them regular updates regarding COVID-19. The health and wellbeing of our employees is paramount to us. This is why we have a safety, health, and environment (SHE) team at Roche, which has been dynamic and timely with its input during COVID-19. We were well prepared with masks, gloves, and PPEs from the onset of the pandemic and implementing procedures for the wellbeing and safety of our team. Roche was also one of the first companies to deliver diagnostic kits for the government during the outbreak on time without any real delays, as we have a strong instrument base in the country. Roche has a state-of-the-art testing solutions—the cobas® 6800—its leading diagnostic technology placing it in high demand at this critical time.</p><h4>How has the company worked closely with the Ministry of Health on the pandemic?</h4><p>We have undertaken numerous projects in Saudi Arabia. Roche has established several referral centers for COVID-19 testing. We are also one of the companies that has direct access to high-level governmental decision-makers. We have established a strong relationship with them and hold their trust because when we promise, we perform. We are the only provider of a diagnostic test that can detect both COVID-19 and SARS/Influenza A and B using our cobas® 6800 technology. We value delivering on our commitment of providing fast and accurate testing at the highest level over and above any financial considerations. We continue to deliver with our solutions and enjoy a strong partnership with the Ministry of Health and other key stakeholders across the Kingdom.</p><h4>What is unique about Roche's cobas® 6800 screening technology?</h4><p>Since 2014, the cobas® 6800 - and similarly for the cobas® 8800 - Systems have established the new standard for routine molecular testing by delivering fully integrated, automated solutions providing up to 96 results in about 3 hours and a total of 1,440 results of donor screening, infectious disease, sexual health, transplant, respiratory, and antimicrobial stewardship. Based on Nobel prize-winning PCR technology, the systems deliver proven performance with full automation, increased throughput, fast turnaround time and complete track connectivity validated for molecular testing, providing users with greater flexibility to consolidate their IVD and Lab Developed Testing to a single system while increasing overall workflow efficiencies.</p><h4>How has the pandemic changed Roche's market position?</h4><p>As you can imagine, the pandemic has affected everyone. At Roche, we understand the enormous global demand for novel coronavirus tests. In response to the ongoing public health crisis, Roche is making substantial investments in building additional manufacturing capacity to increase production of tests and the instruments on which they are performed. This effort will draw on the strength of our global network across multiple sites and involve multiple functions of our organization. Roche will continue to increase the production of our molecular tests through capacity expansion of new and existing lines. We will also significantly increase the number of cobas® 6800/8800 Systems placed worldwide to increase testing capacity. In a pandemic such as this, we stand with the government as a partner out of our concern for the community we serve — which further strengthen our relationships with key stakeholders and demonstrates how effective public-private partnerships can be established. Our singular focus is on producing as many tests as possible to support our customers, communities and patients in responding to this unprecedented public health crisis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a brief background of the achievements of the past year before COVID-19 hit the sector? </h4><p>One of the most important achievements of our company is the finalization of the Neom Airport project in a short period of six months. An empty runway has been converted to a Category 1 international airport on a small scale. At the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 before COVID-19, we were awarded two large-scale projects to execute at King Abdullah Financial District where the G20 was planned.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the current economic climate and reality for the construction sector in Saudi Arabia? </h4><p>The pandemic is worldwide, and the impact on daily life and business is something that no one could have predicted. It has many different impacts that we are facing and experiencing, and the situation is extremely dynamic and fluid, making it difficult to make plans. We are one of the fortunate companies, as we've managed our company during this extraordinary crisis as well as we could. We have around 7,000 employees and have only faced 33 cases as of date. Our clients have been extremely proactive, and although we have had curfews and work stoppages, we were not greatly affected. The global supply chain has been affected by the situation, so we are starting to see delays in supplies. Because of the health and safety measures, work efficiency has been affected, and we are still working on a mitigation plan to get over this situation.</p><h4>What is your current split between public and private contracts, and what are your targets for the future? </h4><p>With our current contracts, it became 20/80; because of  the new large contracts that we were awarded are public. The last two contracts we signed were with King Abdullah Financial District Management and Development Company, which is under the Public Investment Fund. In the short term, it looks like the public sector will be more prevalent.</p><h4>How are the mega and giga projects shaping the country's construction sector, and which projects are you working on? </h4><p>During the pandemic, we started to receive many enquiries and are currently bidding for Diriyah Gate development in Riyadh and quoting for smaller projects in Al Ula and the Red Sea. As a company, we are prequalified and present in all the new developments. We are extremely hopeful about these projects, which should be a dynamo for the economy in the short to mid-term. These investments are essential for the ongoing targets of 2030.</p><h4>What practices did you develop in your previous projects to create a greener future?</h4><p>Our founding partner Baytur Construction Company is the first Turkish contractor to receive an ISO certification. When we established our company here by following the culture and procedures of our founding partner, we immediately set up all our environmental and health and safety measures as our basics. We have a fairly good health and safety track record, and thanks to our procedures and experienced personnel, our staff has accepted this as a company culture. In 2019, we executed a military project for the Royal Saudi Airforce in Tabuk in partnership with an American company and we received the National Safety Award from the United States for that project. We benefited from this culture during the pandemic, which reduced its impact significantly. For environmental, we are one of the few companies certified by ISO 45001, and each project has its own requirements. For the airport project that we executed in Neom, there were strict environmental requirements as it is an untouched area. In our company, we take many precautions and procedures as a rule of thumb, and we grow our experience with such a company culture. For example, we have been working at King Abdullah University for Science and Technology for four years with 2,000 laborers on a daily basis, which is almost equivalent to the population of the university. We have a great environmental and health and safety track record there and we have received appreciation from the KAUST administration.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals to lead the company out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the long-term targets for 2021? </h4><p>Our main short-term target is to maintain our organization as it is today and continue to keep our staff safe, secure, and healthy. We hope this difficult period will be  starting to ease gradually, and we will learn how to live with the virus. Companies will start to adapt, which will bring a big movement in business, as what was lost needs to be recovered. The mid- to long-term target, therefore, will be to maintain and boost our activity via upcoming opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>You were part of London Stock Exchange's ELITE Program. Why did you participate in this program, and how </strong><strong>do you evaluate your experience?</strong><br>The ELITE program was introduced around the time we decided to enter the stock exchange. Morocco then signed an agreement with the London Stock Exchange to join the ELITE program, and we benefited from a one-year training at the Casablanca Stock Exchange. We have made significant progress, even if there has been a bit of delay recently because of the tax controls. We have passed all the controls and we have done the ELITE training; therefore, we are better prepared today than we were yesterday.</p><p><strong>Where do you stand today in terms of your IPO?<br></strong>Over the last two years, it has been slightly delayed because there have been a number of tax audits. The tax authorities needed money so it taxed companies, meaning 2020's results will not be as good as expected. When you want to go public, you have to look at the last three years; however, we will get there, in spite of our delay.</p><p><strong>Your company has dominated the market of vessel monitoring systems (VMS). What has allowed Soremar to </strong><strong>become a market leader?<br></strong>It does not happen overnight. It is 36 years of hard work and seriousness. We are in a maritime niche so we shine because this sector is like a club. Being a part of this family is not only an honor, but something we must live up to. Your services rely heavily on technology. </p><p><strong>How have digitalization and AI impacted your value proposition?<br></strong>Today, any ship owner can know where his boat is—he can see it and he can communicate with it by satellite or message. This is a plus. When I started, we sold our know-how: there were four or five components to change in a radar for which we would bring the parts and install them. Today, for the same broken radar, you look quickly and see if the card has to be changed. If you have the part, you put it in, and the commander signs off. If you don't have it, you pass it along. Previously, machines were indefinitely repairable; today, they are disposable. No one has a choice. We go with the flow, we adapt, and we work. There is an important human element that has disappeared as a consequence of technological advancements.</p><p><strong>What is Soremar's vision in the medium and long term? <br></strong>Our first objective is to go public. Second, we are planning a development in Morocco, whereby our 17th agency will open this year. We must always keep moving forward. There is also the African vision. In financial terms, how do you evaluate 2019? Our turnover in 2019 grew 6% YoY, but it was a difficult year financially. For the investors, it is a matter of trust. As soon as this trust is affected, everything stops. There has to be a plan, a vision, and a schedule and one can enact it by pushing the sector to go along with you. According to official figures, 8,400 companies shutdown in Morocco in 2018. In 2019, that number increased by 5%.</p><p><strong>How have payment delays impacted operations in the sector?<br></strong>Currently, everybody is cautious; before selling equipment to a customer, you must check if he is solvent or not. Even the banks have started using ratings. This means companies with bad ratings will have a hard time surviving.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>PR Media started its operations 16 years ago. What have been its main successes?<br></strong>PR Media was established in 2004 and became a pioneer in the public relations sector in Morocco and more broadly North Africa. We quickly understood that we had to rely on experts and dedicated services to bring their voices to a variety of audiences such as the media, consumers, influencers, and so on. We have seen some great successes. The first was our expansion into Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. We have been affiliated with the American giant H+K Strategies since 2005, which gives us the benefit of a network of key expertise throughout Africa, both French and English-speaking. Our growth is also embodied in our human resources, namely the 50 or so consultants who make up the agency's strike force. Our third success concerns the diversity of our sectors of intervention. We cover a wide spectrum from energy to entertainment, food processing, cybersecurity, sports, luxury goods, real estate, wellness, transport, consumer goods, and more. You are an established player in the communications field.</p><p><strong>How did PR Media reach this point?<br></strong>This is the result of the recognition of our customers. We have been working with some companies since our creation, which is quite rare in our industry. Our ability to listen and adapt is fundamental. We have successfully taken every turn in the transformations that have affected markets since the early 2000s: the mobile revolution, the internet revolution, the digital revolution, and so on. We have evolved by being proactive, accompanying changes, and even showing pedagogy toward our customers, who are not always informed and aware of new uses. A few years ago, we created a subsidiary entirely dedicated to digital and the management of e-influencers and digital communities.</p><p><strong>How do you differentiate yourselves from other agencies?<br></strong>We are a leading agency because our expertise is recognized, and our clients' interests are our top priority. We develop relevant and effective strategies for them, often going beyond what they expect and with concrete, measurable results in line with their objectives. This is our corporate culture: always do better, always do more. Our support and our ability to guide are strong differentiators.</p><p><strong>How do you make sure you remain up to date in such a fast-paced world?<br></strong>PR Media has a strategic monitoring department that regularly updates its working standards, tools, and methods. This allows us to stay one step ahead of the transformations that will impact our activities. More broadly, we have reviewed our organizational model by abandoning the traditional silo-based operation and moving from a vertical to a horizontal structure.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of AI, big data, and automation?<br></strong>We conduct regular research to better understand the expectations of journalists, influencers, consumers, and citizens in general. We rely on advanced analytical tools with which we can better identify the major themes of conversations on social networks as well as the tone. The predictive data offered by AI can be used to target content that will have the greatest impact. We also use platforms that help us monitor media and predict the impact of news on our clients' image.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about your international expansion?<br></strong>PR Media is a Moroccan agency, with a North African geographic footprint and a reach that covers the entire continent and beyond. With our affiliation with H+K Strategies, we can operate in all territories, relying on teams that have a perfect understanding of the country where they are located. We are a local but also a global agency, with the conviction that digital technology is changing the notion of borders.</p><p><strong>What is your target for 2020?<br></strong>We have successfully evolved from a PR agency to an influence consultancy firm. In 2020, this trend will continue with the in-house development of new services and skills based on the possibilities offered by recent technological developments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us a short introduction to GFI?<br></strong>I founded a company in 1987 to sell software solutions in Morocco. Before, companies used to sell hardware and customers developed their own applications. I started the company with a small capital of EUR5,000 and developed it until 2003, when the GFI group became interested in the Moroccan market. Fast forward to January 2019, when I got involved in GFI's operations and was appointed president of GFI Africa. GFI is present in many countries, including 15 in Africa. We are growing through acquisitions. We recently bought companies in Ivory Coast, Tunisia, and Cameroon. At present, we are looking to acquire some companies in Senegal.</p><p><strong>Who are the key partners for GFI in Morocco?<br></strong>In Morocco, we serve more than 300 active customers with maintenance contracts. These include private customers, large industries, multinational firms, and public-sector entities. We help them evolve their IT systems.</p><p><strong>What kind of digital opportunities does the company see </strong><strong>in Africa?<br></strong>Africa remains the least developed continent in the world unfortunately, but this trend can be reversed with new technologies. Thanks to digitalization, countries such as Rwanda have completely transformed themselves. Kenya is another such example. Africa is perfectly positioned to use the latest technologies and innovations and get ahead of the curve—we are not obliged to go step by step. Our ambitions reflect the desire of our African subsidiaries to remain in the top class of companies considered to be export champions. We give the best of ourselves to consolidate this position and to establish ourselves as a true partner of customer information systems in all countries in Africa. The trust GFI has in its employees is a key element of its approach to the market, because the companies that trust us have to first deal with teams: men and women trained and certified in the latest technological advances. We are, therefore, able to advise our clients, who invest in a long-term relationship with GFI. We are consolidating our positions in Africa and developing our activity by helping companies benefit from our know-how.</p><p><strong>What is your opinion of Moroccan human talent and gender equality?<br></strong>I would say that there is a difference between what is possible and what is being done in Morocco. Women enjoy equal rights in Morocco. The labor law has been upgraded to ensure equal pay, equal treatment, and so on. Moreover, the nationality law was amended to give women the ability to pass citizenship to their children. Women in Morocco, unlike in other regional<br>countries, do not need permission to work, open an account, or establish a business. In terms of access to education, a great effort has been made. As a result, the enrollment rate of girls is as high as that of boys. It is lower particularly in rural and underprivileged areas because there is a lack of infrastructure. Overall, there is a lack of implementation. Unfortunately, the difference becomes more tangible in the professional world because we have not yet created an environment that allows women to reconcile their personal and professional lives. A national strategy is needed to increase the female participation rate in the workforce. At present, it is around 21-22%, while for men it is between 70 and 75%. According to a World Bank study, higher female participation can help Morocco boost its growth rates by up to 2%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you evaluate the fintech sector in Morocco?<br></strong>In Morocco, we are fortunate to have financial regulations that have helped payments advance. Only after the payments industry developed did regulators step in. This allowed innovation to enter the market. The central bank and financial regulators in Morocco have been extremely forward thinking. For example, the PIN system for ATMs had no legal framework until a few years ago, which meant legal disputes were difficult to settle; however, the country chose to let legal structures develop naturally rather than forcing implementation in a way that might not have served the industry as a whole. This allowed the system to figure out the areas most in need of oversight in an organic way. In terms of fintech, the impact of the internet has only had a significant influence on Morocco in the last six to seven years. We have been lacking in terms of infrastructure, incubators, and other necessary aspects that are needed to support a fintech ecosystem. There is now a process for supporting public and private initiatives. The next question is how we can develop this space.</p><p><strong>Who are your main partners in Morocco?<br></strong>We partner with banks, though we also work with new actors, namely payment system providers (PSP). Today, PSPs are the real players in the payment landscape. At present, telecoms firms are the main competitors of banks. Our customers include banks, PSPs, and telecoms firms. We also have special customers such as the highway authority in Morocco. In total, we have around 15-20 clients.</p><p><strong>What are the main sources of revenue for your company?<br></strong>Our technology covers the entire value chain. Either we provide the software and train the company and they pay us for maintenance, or we cover every area of the process on our own. It is the same distinction between using Microsoft Word on your desktop or using Windows 365 on the cloud. We have also shifted to the cloud.  This is what we call the software-as-a-service (SAAS) model. We advise customers to move toward the SAAS model because it allows them to experience innovative solutions without large CAPEX expenditures.</p><p><strong>Do you still allocate 10% of your revenue to R&amp;D?<br></strong>We are proud to say we allocate 16% of our revenue to R&amp;D. We want to create a culture of innovation. This 16% goes into making our products better and improving every aspect of our business.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about token payments?<br></strong>We have been in the tokenization business for the past five or six years. We work with numerous partners across the world, including a major contactless player in Japan. Our work outside Japan has predominantly been on the Android platform. There is a huge market in Morocco for mobile payments, but less so for tokenization because fewer people own advanced phones. We are developing an e-wallet that is not registered to a physical card, but rather an account. This system will challenge the cash-based economy and promote financial inclusion. If we are able to increase the number of transactions on our platform, there will be tangible changes to our economy and society. Additionally, electronic payments ensure easier tax collection, which explains why the government has announced a three-year tax holiday for those who enroll in electronic payment systems.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on the potential in Africa?<br></strong>We provide payment services for eight nations in West Africa with the same central bank, the Central Bank of West African States. We are also heavily present in South Africa, so much so that we have an HPS South Africa subsidiary. Business-wise, Africa represents more than one-third of our global revenue. Africa is not in the midst of a digital transformation, but a digital birth. We are creating this environment from the ground up, and, therefore, we are not facing the same hurdles that we saw in other more advanced payments marketplaces.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of APEBI?<br></strong>APEBI represents digital, telecommunications, and innovative companies. We connect this community to the largest players in the market, which together represent more than 80% of the turnover in the sector. Since the beginning, we defined five pillars for our mandate: digitally transforming all sectors of the economy; gathering data; nurturing a close relationship with neighboring countries; promoting digital ways of doing business; and sustainability.</p><p><strong>How has the COVID-19 pandemic changed the way of doing business in Morocco?<br></strong>Every revolution arises after a great crisis. Now is the time for the digital revolution. Before the pandemic, we realized that certain groups in the country were hesitant when it came to digital transformation, e-commerce, e-governance, and so on. Digitalization was rarely framed as a priority for the country. The pandemic has shaken the foundations of our system, forcing us to adopt approaches and ways of doing businesses previously unthinkable. For a long time, we have mainly been discussing how to digitalize, and now that we are forced to do it, we are discovering that digitalization represents not only a comfort, but also a tool to ensure the physical and psychological wellbeing of the world's population and the global economy.</p><p><strong>From your experience at APEBI, what solutions can digitalization offer to the current situation?<br></strong>During the outbreak of the pandemic, we sought ways to use technology as a means to inform the public and limit the spread of the virus. We turned to a start-up that works on AI and big data. In three days, we developed a prototype with abundant information based on trends in the worst-affected countries to help the Ministry of Interior anticipate the different phases and introduce the right measures. At that point, we realized Morocco was ripe with skills and potential to develop other similar initiatives. We launched a nationwide call for projects, Hackcovid, targeting any start-up, student, or individual with an idea to assist the country during the outbreak. Within 48 hours, we received 150 digital projects, of which we selected about 30 in fields such as security, food safety, health, and economic competitiveness. Successful examples are the COVID-19 tracker, mobile payment solutions, chatbots that can answer questions about COVID-19 in Darija (a Moroccan dialect) or French, a solution that will connect all the grocery stores in the neighborhoods to transmit aid, and a social network for the healthcare industry that allows information to be conveyed in real time. Our role has been to mobilize a large number of computer specialists and<br>coders to bring these ideas to life, and to create connections with private or public partners. We are now looking to launch Hackcovid Africa with about six Northern and Western African countries. Morocco is among the first countries to be affected by the pandemic on the continent, so it is important we share any progress we have made. Equally important, Hackcovid Africa will support our ongoing project for the creation of an African confederation of technology to mutualize our common problems and share our progress.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for the Fez Smart Factory project, which you are launching as the director of Alten Maroc?<br></strong>We launched competitions at several universities to find innovative start-ups that could nurture Moroccan competences and respond to the future needs of the market. In this context, we landed on Fes, which could be Morocco's Silicon Valley and also happens to be the birthplace of Alten Maroc. We wanted to create an Industry 4.0 pole to boost the digital and creative industries in Fes and bring the market closer. Within the framework of the CGEM, we brought together the digital commission, the digital economy commission, the start-ups commission, the employability commission, and the VSE-SME commission, to create a technology park. Besides being a space for the incubation of star-ups, this is primarily an integrated zone where<br>suppliers and customers share the same space and where jobs and opportunities are created.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were Alstom's main operations and achievements in 2019?<br></strong>In 2019, we were proud to take part in the entry into commercial service of two major railway projects. The first was the inauguration of the iconic high-speed train line linking Casablanca to Tangiers. We have been working on this project for years, and we are proud of the high quality of this project, conducted together with our customer the Moroccan National Railways Office (ONCF). In January 2019, Casablanca also celebrated the entry of the city's second tramway line into commercial service. In the frame of this project, we were in charge of delivering the rolling stock, testing, and commissioning.</p><p><strong>What did Alstom provide for the high-speed train project?<br></strong>In 2010, ONCF selected Alstom to supply up to 12 Avelia Euroduplex. Avelia Euroduplex is a service-proven train that integrates all the latest developments in terms of connectivity, accessibility, and safety. After the shipment of the 12 trains, we have been in charge of train testing and commissioning.</p><p><strong>What are your main domestic operations currently?<br></strong>Present in Morocco since nearly a century, Alstom has contributed to several emblematic railway projects here. In the field of urban mobility, Alstom delivered the first Citadis trams to the cities of Rabat and Casablanca. In the field of mainline, Alstom supplied 20 Alstom Prima II electrical locomotives in 2011, and it successfully delivered the first of 30 Prima M4 Electrical to ONCF in 2019. In the field of maintenance, Alstom has been ensuring the maintenance of 47 ONCF locomotives since 2015. Alstom also has an industrial plant in Fes called Alstom Cabliance. In this site, we produce cable bundles and electrical switch boxes for rail applications that are supplied to our rolling stock plants and mounted on trains exported around the world.</p><p><strong>What innovative efforts are being made in Morocco?<br></strong>Alstom is a leading global innovative player for a sustainable and smart mobility. In this regard, we are developing an innovation ecosystem around our activities with the aim of nurturing and growing new green technologies in our solutions. In Morocco, we have always been committed to delivering our most innovative solutions based on our customers' expectations and requests. In addition, our industrial site in Fes was certified ISO 14001 in early 2019.</p><p><strong>When will zero-emission trains arrive in Morocco?<br></strong>Alstom is not leading or initiating the orders but is committed to providing best-in-class mobility solutions to its customer.</p><p><strong>What is Alstom's goal in Morocco for in 2020?<br></strong>In Morocco, there have been a few projects announced that we are considering as main opportunities in 2020: EMU, Signaling, Casa 3, and four tramway lines. With its local railway expertise—98% local staffed, with a few experts coming from France—and a full range of proven and competitive transport solutions, Alstom aspires to continue its partnership and contribute to railway<br>development in Morocco.</p><p><strong>What CSR activities are you pursuing in different areas of Morocco?<br></strong>We have signed a partnership with the Mohammed VI Foundation for the environment within the framework of the COP22 that took place in Marrakesh in 2016. This partnership concerned the promotion of environmental awareness sessions at public primary schools in Tangier and a school in the neighborhood of Fes. Around 3,000 students were reached. Recently, we launched a new CSR project in Fes around entrepreneurship. Participants will learn how to formulate a commercial idea and business plan and develop their idea up to realization.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about Morocco's textile industry?<br></strong>The textile and apparel (T&amp;A) industry plays a key role in Morocco's economy. Aside from being the top industrial<br>employer in the country accounting for around 180,000 jobs, it is one of the few sectors that employs a large number of<br>women and young people. Contributing to 15% of Morocco's industrial GDP, it also plays a leading role in the trade balance, representing 25% of the country's exports. One of its major competitive advantages lies in its proximity to Europe and therefore its ability to react immediately to new trends to be delivered in short lead times and in flexible quantities. Inditex is one of the biggest clients of the Moroccan T&amp;A industry, accounting for a significant part of the sector's employment and exports.</p><p><strong>How has the competitiveness of the sector evolved since 2014?<br></strong>In 2015, the T&amp;A sector adopted an innovative and ambitious strategy, resulting from a strong, effective and unprecedented public-private partnership. This strategy is part of the 2015-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan and was built around targeted, clear, conscious, and aligned choices between the state and the profession. It aims to make the Moroccan textile sector a leading player on the continental scale and around the Mediterranean. The combination of a conducive international environment and the ambitious national strategy has given the sector a new impulse that is not limited to exports, but also to investment and employment. Four years after the implementation of the national T&amp;A strategy, the sector has created 70,000 jobs and generated more than EUR800 million in additional exports.</p><p><strong>How was 2019 for the textile sector?<br></strong>After recording an average annual growth rate of 5% since 2012, exports of Moroccan textile and garments to Europe stagnated in 2019, which can be explained by the less preferable market access conditions granted by the EU to Moroccan exports in comparison with countries such as Turkey and some Asian and African nations, which enjoy duty-free access to<br>European markets.</p><p><strong>What can the government do to improve relations with the EU?<br></strong>We have been trying, for almost a decade now, to get more favorable access conditions to EU markets. Indeed, countries from Asia or Turkey can export garments to the EU without paying duties regardless of the origin of the fabric used to manufacture them, while Moroccan garments pay duties on their FOB prices if the fabrics used originate from outside the Pan Euromed region. This means that duty is paid not only on the imported fabric, but also on the added value generated locally in Morocco, which is unfair. Fully aware that any change in the rules of origins with the EU has to be decided at the political level, members of the Moroccan government have showed their support for our position and have started talks with European officials to help turn the tide in our favor and level the competitive playing field.</p><p><strong>What sustainability initiatives are you implementing?<br></strong>Morocco embarked on a sustainability path several years ago when we made our first 100% Made in Morocco 100% sustainable denim collection. The industry made several investments in equipment allowing for a more sustainable way of production, and factories are increasingly considering renewable energy alternatives to reduce their energy bills. In addition, projects are being launched to establish a recycling ecosystem in the T&amp;A industry to close the loop, reduce the impact of our production on the environment, and offer brands and retailers sustainable production alternatives.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>Earlier this year, I could have responded with all confidence. Unfortunately, with the COVID-19 pandemic inflicting on<br>our industry worldwide what could be qualified as the worst blow in its history, our goal today for the remainder of 2020<br>is first damage control. Then, depending on how things evolve with the pandemic in Morocco and the rest of the world,<br>we'll adjust. The Moroccan T&amp;A will be there when COVID-19 is defeated to stand by its international partners and<br>relaunch our industry together.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the company?<br></strong>We are a family company, established almost 50 years ago. We used to be focused only on industrial activity, but we are now involved in several activities divided by separate groups. One is Groupe Palmeraie Développement, which is involved in real estate, hotels, leisure, golf, and the like. It is different from the second group, Palmeraie Industry and Services, which has four separate activities: industry, for which I am responsible; mining; education; and agriculture. Industry represents the largest part of the group, and we continue to develop it in Morocco. One of our strategies is to look into other countries, and our other strategy for Morocco is to invest in new activities. This is why we started our automotive business here, which has been operating for seven years. We supply Renault and Peugeot Morocco with filaments and some foam pieces. We started a JV with a Spanish group called Jobelsa Automotive to produce covers for cars solely for export. As a company, we are far surpassing the growth of Morocco, which stood at 2.4% in 2019, and we are almost at double digits. We have had double-digit growth for the past two years, and for the last seven years growth has been over 6%. We have a strategy to focus not only on our core business, but to also start new businesses. We just started a new factory here, a recycling project where we transform plastic bottles to fibers.</p><p><strong>Can tell us more about your activities in the agriculture sector?<br></strong>It is a new sector for us. I am not managing it. An investor acquired some shares and invested USD20 million in the company. In our case, we received almost USD30 million from the UK. With agriculture, we are mostly involved in fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, and blueberries, for export, mainly to Europe. This is a segment that we have received investment in. We are also developing a Moroccan type of date.</p><p><strong>How have technology and innovation affected your operations in Morocco?<br></strong>We have tried to imagine how AI could affect our business. In the future, it will replace everything. When we compare ourselves to European companies, we are at the same levels. We signed a license with Sealy, which is the worldwide market leader, to be the licensee in Morocco and the region. It is working in the same way we are doing here. Technology will not have a big effect on the business in the near future. Perhaps beyond that, people are considering putting sensors in mattress to analyze how people sleep through the night. We have made some technological advancements in distribution. We started with a website about four years ago. There is still a small turnover, but the next generation will only buy their mattresses and furniture online. In terms of production, for a Moroccan sofa, for example, we are able to deliver an order for a customized sofa in the same day if the order is made before 10 a.m. This has been enabled by technology.</p><p><strong>How would you evaluate the Moroccan resource pool </strong><strong>in terms of R&amp;D?<br></strong>We have more than 2,000 employees. For us, R&amp;D is a strong part of our strategy. We have succeeded in the past because we invest in R&amp;D. We have a big showroom to display our new products to our customers and distributors. We entered into a soft partnership with Dow, one of the biggest chemical companies in the world. We signed a partnership to have its service center and R&amp;D department here. In 2018, we introduced in Africa the first mattress that repels mosquitoes, and we obtained a trademark. These developments are important to the country and continent, which is why we continue to invest in R&amp;D.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the main role of BASF in the Moroccan </strong><strong>economy?<br></strong>BASF provides raw materials and solutions for the industrial value chain here, so it truly creates value in Morocco and beyond. We provide the ingredients for local producers in Morocco and create value in terms of products, jobs creation, and innovation. This is the big differentiator in what BASF does in Morocco that others perhaps do not. We are not B2C; we are B2B. We work with most of the big players and medium-sized companies in Morocco. We call the mid-sized local companies our local champions. We also bring in know-how and the right sustainable solutions for growth. BASF's aim is not to sell products, but to sell the right products so that our customers can grow and differentiate themselves from the competition. We seek to give our customers an edge with the most up-to-date materials and solutions. We want to create value in the country. Our KPIs reflect this—we want to sell things that match our customers' needs and add value. We also help producers in Morocco expand their business geographically into places like South Africa and Gabon. We even produce in Morocco and export to sub-Saharan Africa. We also provide our customers with technical training and hold regular symposiums. BASF's agricultural division goes into the field with a caravan and shows farmers new technologies, helps them identify and combat diseases, and teaches them to increase their yields in a smart and responsible way. Our aim is not to flood the market with products, but to help the customer grow in a sustainable way. BASF builds long-term relationships.</p><p><strong>Who are BASF's main partners?<br></strong>They are in many sectors. Our partners are large players and the local champions in the paint sector and in the shampoo and detergent manufacturing segments. We also serve companies using coatings and most of the local Moroccan brands manufacturing shoes and mattresses. We look at what these customers want, and if we do not have a ready-made solution, we customize a solution for them. BASF signed an exclusive agreement with PSA Maroc regarding e-coating  and a brandnew production line. </p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about this tender?<br></strong>The strategy is to work hand in hand with our global key accounts, and PSA is a key account for BASF worldwide. Whenever PSA invests in a country, we work to help it because PSA knows our products, so there is no disruption to its production lines. There are companies that want to invest in Morocco because BASF is here, and we can provide them with technical and warehousing services and technical expertise. Companies also feel comfortable when they see other multinationals already established here.</p><p><strong>What AI and digital technologies and solutions is BASF using in Morocco?<br></strong>In Morocco, most of the digital trends we are following are related to agribusiness. We are fairly advanced in screening fields, identifying diseases at an early stage, and using the right solutions at the right time. This includes monitoring diseases and their spread and the application of treatments. This is extremely helpful because agriculture is a major pillar of Morocco's economy. We also have to be careful with the responsible use of any solutions. In terms of digital technology, we also have online platforms where customers can order, pay, and arrange for delivery of products directly with us.</p><p><strong>Would you expand on BASF's internal mobility program for its employees?<br></strong>Our job positions are open to anyone worldwide. If one has the right skills and competencies, they have the opportunity to apply. We have people in Germany, South Africa, France, and the UAE. BASF is a multinational. In our country cluster, we have people from Algeria, Brazil, and China. Our HR structure is mobile and based on skills and competencies. Diversity is a driver; it brings a great deal of new vision and ideas with it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What achievements are you most proud of since being </strong><strong>appointed minister?<br></strong>Under the leadership of His Majesty King Mohammed VI, Morocco has strongly boosted its reform process by launching large-scale projects accelerating the process of structural transformation of our economy and achieving strong and more inclusive growth, thus speeding up our country's economic emergence. In the macroeconomic field, we are exploring alternative solutions to reconcile consolidating macroeconomic stability with social and infrastructure needs. We intend to involve the private sector to a greater extent in the construction of infrastructure through PPPs to enhance the effectiveness of public investment and to better target social expenditure. Regarding reform, our actions will be directed toward those able to concretely improve the business environment, in particular SMEs, and thereby promote investment, employment, and inclusiveness. In 2019, we resolved the problem of the VAT credit, which was weighing heavily on companies' cash flows. We are now committed to reimbursing any credit accumulated over the year and simplifying the VAT system to reinforce its neutrality. A second problem addressed concerns the extension of payment periods, and we have set up an observatory of payment periods and created an electronic platform dedicated to processing complaints from suppliers of public establishments and companies. Regarding access to financing for businesses, and more particularly for SMEs and micro enterprises, we recently launched an integrated business support and financing program focused on three major axes: the financing of entrepreneurship, the coordination of actions in support for entrepreneurship at the regional level; and financial inclusion in rural areas. We have also adopted a National Financial Inclusion Strategy to integrate into the financial system, in addition to the rural populations targeted by the funding support program, populations who have difficulty accessing financial services. </p><p><strong><span></span>Despite global turmoil, Morocco's economic growth remains constant. What are its key drivers?<br></strong>Despite global market outlooks and a recurring drought for several years, GDP growth has averaged nearly 4% since 2008. This performance is the result of the increased diversification of our productive base through integrated sectorial policies. For example, the Green Morocco plan has made our agriculture less dependent on the vagaries of the climate by developing new, high value-added sectors. Meanwhile, the Industrial Acceleration plan has encouraged the emergence of new export sectors with higher technological content, notably in the automotive, offshore, aeronautics, and electronics sectors. As such, automotive production reached 402,000 units in 2018, as compared to 10,000 vehicles in 2004, with a local integration level of more than 50% and a market share of nearly 40% at the level of the African continent. And in order to reduce our energy dependency, we have made significant progress in renewable energy programs, raising the share of renewable energy to around 34% of installed electrical power, with a 2030 target of 52%. Reducing debt and public spending and balancing the deficit are among the objectives of the new finance bill.</p><p><strong><span></span>How will the government ensure the achievement of these objectives?<br></strong>The maintenance of macroeconomic balances is the subject of continuous efforts to control expenditure, improve the yield of tax revenues, and mobilize non-tax revenues. Thus, within the framework of the 2020 budget bill, we will pursue these efforts through rationalization of public expenditure; improving the efficiency of investment expenditure; increasing the mobilization of tax and customs revenues; improving the governance and transparency of public institutions and companies; and introducing new financing mechanisms to reduce the treasury's debt. Simultaneously, the government has committed itself to pursuing structural reforms to strengthen its productive base, making it possible to control the budget deficit and sustain growth, thereby reducing recourse to debt. These reforms will focus on a tax reform, implement provisions of an organic budget law and strengthen the correlation between performance and evaluation and accountability principles, implement a new approach to the management of public investment projects, ensure that investment projects are chosen on the basis of their social and economic impact, and look into the pension system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What makes Morocco a good destination for investment?<br></strong>Morocco's political and economic stability is the number-one reason why investors choose it over other countries. The Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, which gives us stability and a clear shortand long-term vision. All the necessary short-term strategies are in place, including sectorial and ministerial strategies, to oversee the yearly performance of programs and initiatives. Then, there are long-term strategies guaranteed by the monarchy. For example, it is not possible for a new government to make changes to the tax regime easily. This guarantees stability to investors. This stability has wide-ranging effects on the overall economy, including macroeconomic indicators and the exchange rate. Furthermore, Morocco has state-of-theart infrastructure, a key geographical location, and FTAs that give access to more than 1.3 billion consumers in 56 countries. We also recently signed agreements with several African countries, and in 2019 we ratified the establishment of the new African Free Trade Zone (AFTZ). In addition, Moroccan offers highly skilled and talented human resources.</p><p><strong>What are the main opportunities for Moroccan exporters?<br></strong>There are opportunities to be found in any crisis so we must be ready to seize and track them anytime and anywhere. The consequences of COVID-19 have resulted in a global reshaping of value chains all over the world, in particular in the Mediterranean. This is particularly the case for the EU, which might start reviewing some of its positions and economic alliances on the international stage. The EU could consider reestablishing its existing model of the automotive or even aeronautics in other sectors of activity. Here too, Morocco continues to claim a number of advantages for European operators. Despite higher production costs than in other Asian countries, the kingdom offers unbeatable geographic proximity and logistical efficiency. In addition, thanks to its extensive network of free trade agreements (direct access to more than 1.3 billion consumers in 56 countries), Morocco presents itself as a re-export platform to several other countries and continents. In addition, the government offers technical and financial support as well as tax exemptions for the set-up of foreign investors, not to mention its highly specialized and equipped industrial acceleration zones. Another main point is recommending and identifying together the tools, which will combine foreign investment in Morocco, national investment, and the development of the Made in Morocco export. Furthermore, this pandemic could undoubtedly offer one of the main cross-border collaboration beneficiaries for Morocco: accelerating the major global process of nearshoring.</p><p><strong>How is AMDIE helping SMEs?<br></strong>In the current economic crisis, AMDIE is accelerating its efforts to support Moroccan companies in their search for new niches for growth and international business performance. We are recommending and promoting diversification, adaptation, and opening up to new business lines, as well as focusing on export added value. These new strategies can be a successfully leverage to remain productive and competitive in these harsh times. Our goal is to create the groundwork for growth opportunities for Moroccan businesses. If these capacities are acquired and implemented by SMEs, it could help to capture new deals and lower the risk of a potential shutdown. In June 2020, the Ministry of Industry, Trade, Green and Digital Economy launched a set of full support tools and programs dedicated to the Moroccan industrial SMEs. The objective is to give a strong boost to their growth and com</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has been the impact of COVID-19 on your operations and decision-making, and </strong><strong>how is the confederation reacting to the socioeconomic impact of the pandemic?<br></strong>The confederation is heavily involved in all of the discussions with the government. During this crisis, we have been in greater contact with the different entities so that we can bring our point of view on the decisions that have been made. There are three main impacts from the crisis: sanitary, social, and economic. We are involved in the social and economic sides through an entity that was created with ministers, parts of the government, the government body of banks, and CGEM. This is where decisions are being made on the social and economic sides. From that perspective, we are heavily involved; it is almost a full-time job on that front. That is our impact. Many measures to help the private sector and its workers, as well as those in the formal economy, have emerged from this. That is where we are acting the most in this crisis. CGEM conducted an investigation of the economic repercussions of the pandemic and surveyed 1,820 companies on their expectations of payment periods post COVID-19.</p><p><strong>What did the results reveal?<br></strong>The results show that the crisis is deep and impacting everyone in all sectors. Another thing we learned is that about one-third of people are not working. That is a massive number. The third message we got from the survey is that nearly all companies are in a difficult situation; out of 33 sectors, 28 sectors are declaring a fall in revenue of more than 25%. The second part of the study allowed us to test how the private sector has accepted our measures in our government body between the government, CGEM, and the banks. In total, two-thirds of the companies have used the measures, while roughly half of the companies have used all of the measures. This means the measures that have been taken have been extremely helpful for the sector. The last thing the study showed was that payment delays have increased by more than 60 days as a result of the crisis. That's a huge problem worldwide, and it suggests that the economy will contract everywhere around the world. If people cannot pay, companies will go bankrupt.</p><p><strong>Which sectors have been most affected?<br></strong>Getting back to normal is extremely important. Today, industry is a strong sector for Morocco because it is starting with a relocation and redistribution of demand and offerings. Everything will no longer be made in China anymore, and we anticipate more industry spreading out to different countries. There will be opportunities everywhere. Morocco has done a fantastic job in showing that it has a strong industry in the aeronautics and automotive sectors. We are strong not only in textiles and clothing, but also in others. The pharmaceutical industry, for example, has potential. We have a base and are close to and friendly with Europe. Most likely, we have a role to play as an alternative to the European market in terms of supplying industrial products. I would not bet on tourism in the short term, however.</p><p><strong>What are your priorities and goals for the year ahead?<br></strong>As a confederation of entrepreneurs, our goal is to save as many companies and as much employment as possible. We need to protect our supply. That means protecting our people and our companies. At the same time, we need to be realistic and  understand that we cannot stay at home forever. We need to keep in mind other safety measures that can be taken<br>in this situation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main achievements of the bank in Morocco? <br></strong>Since the end of 2019, we have conducted an assessment of the bank's operations in the country over the 2008-2018 period. The purpose of this exercise was to bring transparency within the framework of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Some of the results of this review include: 3.5 million people, more than half of them women, having improved access to clean water and sanitation; 8.5 million people, including more than 4 million women, benefiting from improved health services; nearly 7 million people were connected to the electricity grid; and 16 million people gained better access to transport infrastructure. As far as our strategy is concerned, the priority is to accelerate the pace of achieving the “High 5" priorities that contribute to the implementation of more than 90% of the 2030 SDGs. Our objective is clear: to have an impact, increasingly significant, for the benefit of our beneficiaries. In doing so, we are using a new generation of instruments such as results-based financing, deployed in Morocco since the end of 2018. Finally, our vision will be articulated on the basis of a more inclusive development approach, with social and territorial inclinations. An integrated development approach to support the attractiveness of the territories, the modernization of infrastructures, the industrial acceleration of the country, and the improvement of its logistic competitiveness. At the same time, our support will focus on human development by strengthening the education and health systems, improving access to basic social infrastructure, and opening up rural areas.</p><p><strong>What main operations are in progress?<br></strong>Development is a process with many prerequisites, including support for private-sector development, coupled with a dynamic of industrialization and strengthening of logistics competitiveness with an inclusive development approach that prioritizes two axes: the development of human capital and the attractiveness of the territories. For a development trajectory to tend toward emergence, it must be sustainable, accompanied in particular by a committed energy transition. These are some of the areas in which we have been working alongside the country since the bank's creation. As part of this approach, we approved four new operations at the end of 2019. First, we will finance, to the tune of EUR245 million, a program to develop electricity transmission networks and rural electrification to improve the safety and efficiency of electricity supply. It will also promote the development of renewable energy sources by ensuring the integration of additional electricity production, which will be generated by solar and wind energy sources, currently under development. More than 16,000 households in 720 villages will be connected to the electricity grid. To reinforce the inclusive nature of our action, we have invested in strengthening and expanding social protection in Morocco by providing more than USD200 million by extending social coverage to people with disabilities, vulnerable children, and women. The goal is to increase the rate of compulsory health insurance coverage from 62% of the population in 2018 to more than 80% in 2023. The program will make it possible to build a regional hospital in Guelmim and a specialty hospital in Ouarzazate, each with a capacity of 140 beds. It also provides for the creation of 144 units specializing in the care of people with special needs and the upgrading of the infrastructure and equipment of 100 dispensaries in rural areas. These units will be equipped with telemedicine equipment for rapid and remote patient care. Two other new projects are designed to strengthen the inclusive dimension of our action. The first involves USD220 million to fund the program to support the industrial competitiveness of the regions by equipping territories with new industrial infrastructure in order to strengthen the regions' contribution to the national process of industrial acceleration. The second project, totaling EUR100 million, will benefit the Municipal Equipment Fund in order to set up new industrial activities and improve the quality of public services in rural areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main achievements of </strong><strong>AmCham Morocco in the last few years?<br></strong>A group of CEOs of American and Moroccan companies who had a common goal to develop and bolster US-Morocco business relations created AmCham Morocco in 1966. At the time, there were no formal FTAs, though one of the achievements today for us is the US-Morocco FTA signed and implemented in 2006, which has increased bilateral trade from USD450 million in 2005 to approximately USD4 billion today. The US-Morocco FTA along with other FTAs signed with Europe and African countries and the massive reforms undertaken by the Kingdom have resulted in an increase in the visibility of Morocco, making it more attractive to investors from around the globe.</p><p><strong>What factors attract investment to Morocco?<br></strong>Foreign investors are mostly looking for stable economies, competitive costs of production, proximity to new markets, and high ROI. The good news for Morocco is that the CEOs of American companies and investors established in the free zone of Tangiers like Lear Automotive or Polydesign all express their satisfaction with choosing Morocco as a platform for production and export to proximity markets. Moreover, their manufacturing facilities have excellent KPIs when compared to competing facilities in Europe. We have the same positive assessment from investors in the Midparc in Casablanca or the ones in the Kénitra Free Zone. We really should pay tribute to the kingdom of Morocco for its commitment to upgrading its infrastructure and building world-class facilities such as Tangier Med port.</p><p><strong>What is the biggest challenge in doing business here?<br></strong>Morocco has improved its ranking in doing business published by the World Bank year after year, but a lot remains to be done to cut down on bureaucracy and simplify the roadmap for investors. Today, one can literally set up a business in 48 hours. They can acquire the company name, tax number, and so on either directly through the regional investment centers (CRI) or through local CPAs, pay their taxes online, access the customs' agency and port services online, and pay utilities online; however, investors still complain about bureaucracy and lack of coordination between agencies. The investor wants to see clear and consistent procedures in writing, which should be the same whether one is in El Jadida or Beni Mellal. To achieve this, Morocco should: accelerate and improve e-government services; publish in writing all procedures and requirements; reduce the load of paperwork to save time and money; digitalize payments to avoid cash circulation; and make sure we have inter-agencies coordination and synchronization.</p><p><strong>What events are you planning for 2020?<br></strong>Most of our events are planned based on the need and feedback from our members. We also plan events that tackle key challenges identified by the Moroccan government. In 2020, we are planning a forum on Water and Sustainability to discuss innovative water solutions and technologies. Later, we will host a roundtable on social responsibility to showcase American companies' practices in the field and create the awareness about giving back to local communities. We have also planned an employability roundtable to discuss future jobs and skills for young graduates seeking employment. We also work on gender and female advancement.</p><p><strong>What are your main goals and objectives for the coming year?<br></strong>The main goal for us is to continue to be the advocate for American companies established in Morocco who invested over USD2 billion and created approximately 100,000 jobs. We will promote Morocco as the best gateway to Africa for American companies willing to expand and access new markets and opportunities. We will also continue to strengthen our partnership with the Moroccan government and help in any way we can to improve the business environment and make Morocco the best place to invest and live in for this generation and generations to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you see UK debt relief and humanitarian aid efforts developing in Africa as a result of the COVID-19 situation?<br></strong>The UK is a large donor into Africa, and in the last few years, we have seen much closer coordination across the UK government's various arms, where we essentially seek to gain the maximum impact from working collectively. In the context of COVID-19, such an alignment is more essential that ever, and we are seeing that not just within the UK government's aid efforts but also across all DFIs and even the private-sector investment community as well. In the UK, as part of the immediate response to the pandemic, we have taken a look across our entire programming work in Africa and ensured that as much of that is directed at providing the help and support that governments across Africa need to help them respond to the pandemic and put in place the building blocks for a strong recovery. People are talking about rebuilding better and building back greener and sustainably and inclusively. That is essentially the focus for us, which is really making sure that every pound and penny counts to help Africa's governments and people recover from the pandemic.</p><p><strong>What is the significance of UK-Morocco relations, and in what areas do you envisage great cooperation?<br></strong>Morocco is one of the most dynamic markets in Africa, the sixth-largest economy on the continent, and one of the easiest countries to do business with. If I look across my network, Morocco is one of those markets where the UK has not been as present and visible as it could be. One of the things we have done recently is set up a joint trade and investment task force designed to look at the common and complementary commercial interests. I see real opportunities here, not least because our export credit agency UK Export Finance has a market risk appetite for Morocco for up to GBP3 billion, and it is currently not entirely untapped. In terms of other opportunities, we have Casablanca Finance City, a truly energetic organization. Agriculture is also a real sector of opportunity, though unfortunately COVID-19 prevented us from being the country of honor at Morocco's SIAM agricultural exhibition in April. I am hopeful we will be able to roll that over to next year and be able to demonstrate the opportunities in the agri space. Renewables is also a real sector of opportunity in Morocco, as is education. At the UK African Investment Summit, we signed an MoU to support UK education provision in Morocco. We created the first British school there and see huge potential for doing more in that education space, including edtech. Morocco is a truly vibrant economy, and there is so much more that I want us to be doing there.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy to boost the confidence of investors and UK companies that want to enter Africa?</strong><br>According to traditional investors such as Unilever and Diageo that have operations on the ground, times are tough, as they are around the world, but everyone is committed to Africa and committed to doing the right thing in terms of helping in that response phase and being part of the recovery phase. The way that we see UK investments across Africa really plays into what the strengths will be for that recovery phase. We are seeing people coming to terms with the new reality. We are seeing and hearing from companies that are interested in the opportunities that will emerge in Africa, whether that is in terms of mergers and acquisitions, business restructuring, or companies that were previously vibrant and dynamic but are perhaps just cash strapped and looking for investment. We will see a return of some of that investment that has flooded particularly out of sub-Saharan Africa in the last few months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What does RMF specialize in?<br></strong>Red Med Group is an independent investment bank specializing in corporate finance and asset management established in Morocco in 2004. RMF provides a wide range of advisory and financial services to governments, major international and local companies, as well as SMEs. RMF's core business includes mergers and acquisitions transactions, financing through conventional products and capital market (IPOs, bonds issues, and so on), privatizations, and strategy consulting. In that context, RMF has developed a sharp expertise in key industries such as education, health, telecommunications, renewable energies, natural resources, agribusiness, retail, pharmaceutical, banking, insurance, and others. Red Med Asset Management (RMAM) has more than USD600 million under management through a range of eight UCITS funds (monetary, bond, equity, diversified, and dedicated funds).</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about your clients?<br></strong>Regarding the asset management activity, we work with major institutional Moroccan investors including private and public pension funds, insurance companies, banks, as well as SMEs and individuals. In 2019, RMAM was selected through a tender offer launched by a one of the largest pension funds in Morocco to manage a dedicated UCITS aligned with its risk/return profile. With respect to the corporate finance activity, RMF and its employees have contributed to the realization of some of the most important transactions in Morocco catering to both international and national companies. RMF has also advised SMEs on successfully moving up to new levels in terms of size and governance. RMF's services are based on tailored and innovative solutions to capture sustainable value for its clients, regardless of the size of the transaction.</p><p><strong>Do you have any partnerships to assist with SME financing?<br></strong>SMEs, which are keystones to the development of the economy, are involved in different activities pertaining to health,<br>education, trade, agriculture, crafts, tourism, and so on. However, they face difficulties in accessing adequate financing due to the constraints of the banking system, the limited offers of alternative financing, and the lack of resources available to them. The various public and private actors are fully aware of the economic and social importance of a strong and sustainable development for SMEs. In this context and in consultation with various public and private partners, RMF's main priority for the coming years is to strongly contribute to this project by providing effective support to SMEs in order to get competitive access to sources of financing combined with the adequate governance.</p><p><strong>What will happen in the finance sector in the coming years in terms of digitalization?<br></strong>In the last few years, digital technologies have disrupted the financial sector all over the world. Technology innovation<br>is enabling the digital deployment of traditional financial services (payments, bank transfers, and so on) and second-wave services (money transfer and blockchain). Digital technologies in the financial sector in Morocco are still at an early stage of development but growing fast. According to Bank Al-Maghrib, more than one-third of Moroccans do not have access to a bank account. A lack of access to such basic financial services hampers entrepreneurship and holds back economic growth. In the<br>coming years, we will see the emergence of Moroccan fintechs that will unleash the potential of Moroccan digital startups, promote financial inclusion, and help the country reach its development objectives.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for 2020?<br></strong>Morocco is a country with not only great potential but also great challenges. Efforts must be made to develop the<br>country not only through its natural resources and economy, but also through its people. My ambition is to contribute<br>to an environment that will give young people every opportunity to develop their projects for their own good and for the good of the society. We need to attract all those talented young people and give them the tools to develop their skills. My goal for Red Med is to play a role in this direction. We will focus heavily on financing, which we have highlighted as an objective for 2020, and will assist SMEs and young people to gain access to competitive financing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How was the Moroccan participatory environment built up?<br></strong>We deployed our services progressively, as the Moroccan Central Shariah Board approved contracts. We first deployed mortgage financing contracts, then equipment for individuals or industries (cars), an investment mandate that allows participation banks to finance themselves with the Moroccan banking system or institutional investors, and, finally, a contract of investment deposits, which is the savings product for individuals and institutional investors. The Moroccan participatory environment was built gradually by responding to the financing needs of individuals and economic agents primarily on tangible goods, then through the establishment of a mechanism for financing the banking system, and finally investment deposits in 2019. During this period, there was support at the fiscal level because the finance law of 2016 established fiscal neutrality between the participatory and conventional systems. The finance laws of 2018 and 2019 each brought a number of tax measures that accompanied the establishment of products of participatory banks. 2019 was a rich year because it resulted in, among other things, the completion of this fiscal project as well as the issue of sukuk by the state in 2018.</p><p><strong>Liquidity is a major challenge in the banking sector. Does it also affect participatory banking?<br></strong>Indeed, one of the main challenges facing the participatory sector in Morocco is that the level of financing far exceeds the deposits collected by participation banks. There are five participative banks and three windows, so there are eight operators in Morocco. The five banks are all subsidiaries of large Moroccan banks, and the three participative windows depend on French banks operating in the Moroccan market. At the end of 2019, the entire participative environment collected the equivalent of MAD3 billion in deposits and approximately MAD335 million in investment accounts. In comparison to financing, with MAD9 billion in resources, there is a huge gap. This gap is financed mainly by Wakalat Al Istitmar, provided by the head banks of the participative banks. This is the main challenge. We started talks with the central bank in order to put in place other mechanisms to allow participation banks to fill this liquidity gap.</p><p><strong>How has COVID-19 affected your short-term strategy?<br></strong>We had to ensure the health of our employees and our customers, as well as the continuity of service. We deployed different forms of work: teleworking for some central functions and rotations for the branch network employees. Thankfully, there were no issues for these first two weeks. We also encouraged our clients to use mainly digital means through mobile and internet banking. With regard to liquidity management, the central bank took a number of measures to support the banks, in particular the introduction of unconventional refinancing mechanisms by the central bank for the benefit of banks. The central bank had already lowered the key interest rate from 2.25% to 2%, and it took all the necessary steps to ensure satisfactory liquidity in the banking system. There was also implementation by the government at the level of the guarantee fund of a certain number of accompanying measures for banks in terms of guarantees. </p><p><strong>What role has digitalization played in your operations? <br></strong>Earlier this year, we launched a new version of our application that meets 95% of our customers' needs. They can consult their balance, make transfers, pay their water and electricity bills and taxes, and so on. All these elements are there to manage this exceptional situation so people do not need to go out. We have even accompanied the national solidarity effort by setting up automatic transfers to the national fund of COVID-19, a fund set up by the King that helps all the vulnerable agents following this pandemic. The fund was set up in April in just two weeks. All these allow our clients to bank safely from home without having to go to a branch. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As president of APSB, what are your thoughts on the lack of liquidity that brokerage firms </strong><strong>are facing and its impact on the capital market?<br></strong>For traders and the market, which is a healthy one, it is important that the stock prices, with significant trades, reflect the economic reality of the companies and therefore the market. Our exchange market is dominated by institutional owners, which is a positive thing, as institutional investors have a long-term outlook. Institutional buys, however, tend to establish solid and lasting trends. On the other hand, they play an increasing role in cross-sectional variation in stock market illiquidity. Insurance companies, for example, invest almost 50% of their assets in the equity market, which is more than the international standards (less than 10%). In recent decades in Morocco, there has been rapid growth in institutional ownership of common stocks and an increasing presence of institutional traders in stock market that reduced the free float, meaning less shares for sale, which has implications for the liquidity, prices, and valuation of Moroccan equity markets. Another factor is that MSCI downgraded Morocco from emerging market to frontier market for a single reason, namely liquidity. Morocco went from being a market exposed to billion-dollar investments on the radar of major international institutions to the frontier index, a market where there are not as many assets as in emerging markets, even if the Moroccan allocation is higher. It is necessary to implement, or rather amend, the law on securities borrowing and lending. Since there are new laws in the pipeline, we want to include in the first law on lending and borrowing securities the different investors that were excluded from the original law text. A new pool mode that allows anonymity of transactions, which is important too, was also introduced.</p><p><strong>You have been the head of CDG Capital Bourse for almost 12 years. What have been the major achievements?<br></strong>Many structural changes (new rules, greater professionalism, and better standards on an international level) have occurred in the stock exchange sector in general, and the APSB, as a stakeholder, took part of this new dynamic. For example, the watchdog became more independent, strong, and efficient, and the stock exchange demutualized, modernized its information system, and set up a new ambitious strategy. Maroclear (Central Depository of Securities) has issued several updates of its information system with new standards and new rules, so we had very challenging years. As for CDG Capital Bourse, these 12 years have been particularly intense since we adopted new strategies aimed at improving our staff expertise and customers experience to stay on top of market trends. We launched the best online stock exchange platform for retail and digitalized our order management system (OMS) that enables us to process client orders from end to end for institutional. We have also developed and implemented an accreditation procedure to ensure that every professional in the field has the appropriate skills and knowledge to practice. This is an important measure for our market because it guarantees that our clients, both local and foreigners, interact with qualified professionals.</p><p><strong>How did APSB and the stock exchange manage the COVID-19 crisis?<br></strong>The market and operators have demonstrated strong resilience and a great capacity for adaptation and innovation. Indeed, stockbroking firms were able to reorganize themselves rapidly into teleworking and adopt measures to protect their employees and customers. Thanks to the mobilization and collaboration of the various partners, the Moroccan Capital Markets Authority, the Casablanca Stock Market, and Maroclear, the market operated normally, and clients were able to carry out their operations in the best conditions. During this period, volumes experienced a significant increase with a notable increase in volatility. This is due to the uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 on firms and the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>There has been a major change in Asma Invest's business plan since its establishment in 1992. Would you </strong><strong>elaborate on the changes since 2015?<br></strong>The major change since 2015 was an important capital increase of MAD1.2 billion (USD122.8 million) from its shareholders. We have almost tripled our capital. We are proud that our shareholders, the governments of Morocco and Saudi Arabia, still see us as an investment tool and a means to better connect the two countries. We are continuing our strategy of being a majority holder—if not a 100% owner—of our businesses. We are still in the process of exiting our minority shareholdings. The idea is to completely move into projects that we operate and diversify the sectors we operate in. Today, real estate accounts for around 50% of our portfolio and agriculture 15-20%. We want to not only continue growing in real estate and agriculture, including agri-business, but also open up to other sectors to achieve a mixed portfolio, ideally with real estate investments comprising 30%-35% and agriculture/agri-business around 25%. We are trying to move into the education and health sectors and are screening opportunities. We are also trying to move further into the industrial sector and industrial zones where we already have a presence. We are currently shareholders in two industrial companies well known in Morocco: Sapino, which prepares industrial zones, and Tanger Med Zones (TMZ), a subsidiary of the Port of Tangier.</p><p><strong>What added value does Asma Invest bring as an investor-operator, and what makes you stand out from other operators in the real estate sector in particular?</strong><br>We have a talented pool of people here, and we are raising them up to be the best team in Morocco. We do not plan to become the largest real estate operator, but one of the best in terms of quality and targeting the middle-income segment in Morocco. We might also offer our expertise to third-party investors either inside or outside of Morocco. We have been approached by investors because we have excellent projects in Casablanca Finance City, where we are the biggest real estate operator so far. We also serve as a co-investment vehicle: we create projects, package them, and find investors to join us for these projects. This means we can do two or three projects with the same amount of money we would need to do one project on our own. It is also good for those investors, because Asma Invest knows the market, from investing to operating. The biggest project we are currently working on is a MAD1-billion (USD100 million) project in Casablanca. For this, we opened up 40% of the capital to investors from outside Morocco.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on about Asma Invest's approach to sustainability?</strong><br>I received a certificate from MIT on strategies for sustainable business. Sustainability is dear to Asma Invest, and I wanted to put it into practice, especially in real estate. Building sustainable housing can cost the same as normal housing. We are having serious discussions internally about how to operate in a more sustainable way. Something we already do is build properties that are energy saving in terms of heating and cooling. For example, we use thermal and acoustic insulation, which is more energy efficient and reduces utility bills. We are thinking about solar energy use and many other environmentally sound practices that we can adopt.</p><p><strong>What key areas will Asma Invest be focusing on in 2020?</strong><br>In 2020, we are putting greater effort into agriculture and agri-business where we want to grow more. In the real estate sector, we are diversifying into other cities, rather than just operating in Casablanca. We have been successful in Casablanca, so the idea is to replicate this business model in other Moroccan cities. We are trying to leverage our know-how while finding financial leverage from outside, such as from banks and investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Elecnor was founded in 1958. How has the company developed since then?<br></strong>Elecnor has transformed significantly over the years, venturing into sectors such as energy infrastructure, renewable energy, and new technologies. The company has also expanded its international presence over the years and is listed on the Spanish stock market. In 2018, Spain made up approximately 45% of our turnover, with the rest coming from international markets. At this time, we have a presence in 55 countries, while the order book also shows the relevance of international business for us. In 1H2019, 78% of orders came from non-domestic markets, meaning the backlog of our international portfolio was more than EUR1.7 billion in this period. </p><p><strong>In 2018, you reported almost EUR74.3 million in net profits. What is your strategy to grow further?<br></strong>We have two areas that complement and strengthen each other. First, Elecnor has evolved into a world leader with the capacity and determination to develop, create, and operate energy infrastructures, as well as becoming a leading provider of specialized industrial engineering services. We have a strong culture of service that serves to build strong, trusting relationships with our long-term customers. The second part is our concession business in the renewable and transmission lines sectors. Our first subsidiary was launched in Venezuela in the 1960s. We lead international expansion and have decades of experience in America and Africa. As a result, we have a deep knowledge and experience of the countries we work in. Elecnor will keep opening new markets, always driven by prudence. In this sense, it is crucial to analyze all the details of a potential new market, as well as study the competitive environment and evaluate our strengths over competitors. In keeping with this strategy, profits have registered increases of around 4% per year for the last three years. Thus, net profit was EUR68.5 million in 2016, EUR71.2 million in 2017, and EUR74.3 million in 2018. In the first six months of 2019, net profits increased by 5% on the same period YoY.</p><p><strong>Do you work with local partners in countries such as Brazil, Chile, and Mexico?<br></strong>Consolidating and positioning the company in these markets has taken many years of work, and involved collaborating with and learning from local private- and public-sector partners. We enter a country alone or by forming temporary unions. Depending on the potential of the country, and whether there are real possibilities of long-term success, we establish a branch or a subsidiary. The three countries that you mentioned are an example of this. We have been working there consistently for several decades. Thanks to our solid 35-year history in the country, Brazil is the second-most important market for Elecnor after Spain. Notable projects include the wind farm in Rio Grande do Sul, one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, and building more than 8,000km of power transmission lines. Elecnor first began operations in Chile in the 1980s. By 1994, we had already overcome a great challenge: building two hydroelectric power plants on the River Duqueco. Elecnor now plays a crucial role in energy development in the country, in terms of transmitting power, developing non-conventional renewable energy, and ensuring efficient energy use in installations. Mexico is also a key market for us and is the result of an extensive 25-year history in the country, evidenced by remarkable projects such as the construction of 65 electrical substations with a total of 7,000MVA of installed power, in addition to the laying of 1,100km of transmission lines and 255km of optical fiber, without forgetting our EPCs in combined cycle plants.</p><p><strong>How much is the company focusing on Latin America?<br></strong>The Latin American market was our first international one, but Elecnor is a global company, and we are present in all five continents. In the Americas, we are also working in countries as competitive as the US and Canada, while we also have a stable presence in Africa, particularly in key markets such as Cameroon, Angola, and Ghana. We also work in Middle Eastern countries such as Oman and Jordan. Australia is as an interesting market where we have also undertaken some ambitious wind and solar projects. I would also like to highlight the international expansion we have achieved in Europe, where we have won unique projects in the UK, Italy, Portugal, and Norway over large local companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are your main operations in Morocco?<br></strong>Morocco's energy transition, which relies on renewable energies and energy efficiency, demand long-term policies. The case of Morocco is interesting in this perspective: being the source of only 0.15% of the world emissions, the energy transition represents a political will of the highest level of the state and emerged not during the COP 22, but in 2009. Priority was given to renewable energies and energy efficiency, through two dedicated agencies, AMEE and the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), in charge developing the largest projects around renewables. Both must go hand in hand. It is essential that a voluntarist policy in energy efficiency be developed in all sectors: electricity production, industry, urban planning, construction, transport, agriculture, and so on. Energy efficiency establishes itself as a key lever by being the most effective strategic approach so that countries meet their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases rapidly and at a lower cost. In 2020, the industrial, agricultural, and public construction sectors were the main targets of AMEE. We could make quicker progress if green financing was available. Even if renewable energies are easily financed today, energy efficiency requires more financial support.</p><p><strong>If people install solar panels on roofs, can they sell electricity back to the grid?</strong><br>One can only produce electricity for personal use. Today, there are public projects for utilities, and MASEN is launching tenders and buying all the electricity produced from promoters. However, there is also a law allowing individuals to produce their own renewable energy and even sell it to another industry, though only on high tension. Low and mid tension is being debated. We have many completely private projects selling to other private companies. Steel, mining, and railway companies are purchasing electricity from private wind projects. We are pushing for legislation on small projects and for public buildings at the highest level of the state. All public buildings such as AMEE should be an example by using a solar roof where possible and reducing their energy bills.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest challenges to reach 15% energy efficiency by 2030?<br></strong>In some cases, it will be easy, and in others it will be difficult. We are pushing to have national financial support for energy efficiency because we can help all farmers be more efficient. In industry, we also need more financing, though it is great that local banks have loans dedicated to energy efficiency. We also need water treatment stations for residential uses and biogas as energy, with the water being used for irrigation. There is a nexus between water, electricity, and energy. There is a program for all 12 regions in the country that we are discussing with mayors to have this energy efficiency reflected. They receive projects from hotels, industry, hospitals, and so on. We can check if the projects have an energy-efficient approach. We will also<br>monitor energy efficiency and by law track the consumption of all big consumers in industry. We have a program to monitor and label all imports and to establish minimum energy performance standards.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about your energy-efficiency workshops in rural areas and how this will be implemented nationally?<br></strong>Heightening awareness and capacity building are keys. We are raising the awareness of farmers in all regions. We train young people how to install and maintain solar pumps. We have a training center in Marrakesh called Green Platform that helps capacity building in different sectors linked to energy efficiency for Morocco and all of Africa. AMEE has 20 agreements with different agencies on the continent. The approach is to have young people who are locally trained doing the installation and maintenance of thousands of small projects. This is how we can create jobs by providing energy to millions of people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What new trends are you working on? <br></strong>We have developed an energy strategy in which renewable energies take a prominent place, thanks to the strategic vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI. Our 2020 goal aims for 42% of our electrical capacity to come from solar, wind, and hydraulic sources; the objective by 2030 is 52%. As a public organization representing the interests of the Kingdom of Morocco, ONHYM also has the mission to search for all the energy potentials of subsoil and geothermal energy. For several years now, we have done evaluation studies for geothermal on the whole country, and we have identified two large areas: Morocco's northeast and south. In the northeast, detailed studies have been carried out to identify the most favorable zones for geothermal energy. We have done a survey of all the potential pockets in the area that will undergo more refined work, since further drilling is necessary to precisely measure some parameters.</p><p><strong>Why is geothermal energy efficient for the country?<br></strong>As a renewable energy source, geothermal energy is an underground source that does not emit CO2, making it sustainable as an energy source. There are countries in northern Europe like Finland that produce almost 70% of their electricity from geothermal sources. We are looking into all the potential sources. It is an ongoing process, and we will see results later as we go deeper into the data. We need more drilling to measure the gradients in some areas in detail, and we will move forward gradually to make sure this energy can find a place if the results are convincing.</p><p><strong>ONHYM signed six petroleum agreements with international companies in 2019. What investment opportunities<br>is the country offering to these international investors?</strong><br>ONHYM's mission is to attract the maximum number of international companies, majors, juniors, and independents to support exploration, which is one of our main missions, alongside promotion. Most of the investments in the field of hydrocarbon exploration in Morocco are made by partners. Looking at investment figures, more than 96% is financed by foreign investors every year. These numbers are due to multiple reasons. One is that Morocco has favorable geology in sedimentary basins, but these have not been sufficiently explored despite the efforts made. Second is our hydrocarbons code, which is considered one of the most attractive in the world. We grant favorable conditions to those investing in exploration, including exemptions from customs duties and from VAT on important equipment and exemption of corporate tax up to 10 years from the date of production. In the event of discovery, the partner owns 75%. A third point is our global macroeconomic framework in terms of political security and geographical positioning. We wish to use our favorable position to increase our regional integration.</p><p><strong>What will be the role of ONHYM in the future if there is a shift toward more renewable sources of energy?<br></strong>The goal for 2030 is 52% of the installed capacity to be from renewable sources. The country's energy strategy has four fundamentals: the country's supply security; energy availability at the best price; regional integration; and sustainable development and environmental protection. In order to have energy security, we need a diversified electricity mix where all sources have their place. We are engaged in an energy transition where renewable energies will be positioned more in our mix. Today, more than 80% of the global energy sources are thermal, namely coal, oil, and gas. The rest is split between nuclear and renewable energy. In 2040, 74% of this mix will still be thermal energy. Looking at the fossil fuels portfolio, coal and oil will fall, but gas will increase as it is considered clean energy. Therefore, despite the green revolution, thermal energies are still predominant but with a stronger emphasis on gas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you describe the evolution of IPSEN Logistics?<br></strong>In the beginning, we were extremely specialized in conventional sea freight and cargo, as well as project cargo. Over the<br>years, we have grown to 15 people, and now we have reached a setup of 120 people. We have developed many services,<br>and much of that is in supply chain. We have our own logistics warehouse as well. Some 12 years ago, we shifted our<br>focus to logistics with an investment of EUR10 million. We are also a customs broker via our subsidiary Ipsen Group<br>Transit. Now, we are heavily involved in the entire supply chain. We transport either by sea, air, or land. We have consolidation hubs in Europe for pickup, storage, and transport. We can transport to Morocco on a weekly basis from any of our hubs in Gelsenkirchen, Stuttgart, Milan, Lyon, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, or Marseilles. We also have our own bonded warehouse in Casablanca with a customs officer on site. The focus is on transporting, clearing, storing, and distribution. We have our own trucks for local distribution and logistics. When you talk about the supply chain, we are actually a one-stop shop.</p><p><strong>What has your strategy been since the COVID-19 outbreak?<br></strong>We had to take some drastic measures to cope with it. We mapped all of our facilities and offices and trained our people to enforce social distancing and use PPE equipment. At present, 80% of our office staff is working from home. In the warehouse, things are more complicated, but since we could not take any risks, we started rotating staff on a three-shift basis. We have seen a drop of about 35% in volume and activity. The positive sign is that logistics is still booming.</p><p><strong>How would you describe the digitalization of IPSEN?<br></strong>We have our own system for transporting, accounting, and customer service. All these are linked to our server and the cloud. We do not have any digital applications that all our employees use, though it is something we will work on down the line. Morocco has been pushing hard for digitalization, especially when it comes to the customs authorities. Notably, Morocco is a full year ahead of its digitalization plan. We had to do weekly training sessions with the customs authorities to ensure a smooth adoption of the new system.</p><p><strong>How would you evaluate the logistics sector in Morocco?<br></strong>One problem we are facing is the cost of real estate. The Logistics Development Association of Morocco (AMDL) is currently in the process of identifying several zones and asking us if we are interested in some land there. AMDL is a major part of our future plans because it will provide us land at an affordable cost.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for the year ahead?<br></strong>In Morocco, there is a great deal of competition. There are perhaps 2,000 freight forwarding competitors in Casablanca alone. There are 800 competitors in customs clearance, 300 in logistics, and possibly 1,000 when it comes to local tracking and distribution. For many years, and still to date, the informal market has been hurting us. It does not pay any VAT, social security, or retirement benefits. Hopefully, the sector will become more formalized. We see it happening with the Association of Freight Forwarding of Morocco (AFFM). We have to focus on those fields where there is less competition and where we can provide the best added value. On a daily basis, we are investing in IT, maintenance, space,our people, and everything else for our customers. This is our focus for the next five years. We want to grow every day, increase our margins, buy better, get more trucks, and have a bigger space. The focus with AMDL is to sell our current warehouse so that we can build a bigger warehouse in a dedicated area. Our vision is to concentrate all our activities in the same area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the strategy behind your facility expansion in Tangier?<br></strong>Tangier is becoming the fastest-growing area in Morocco. As a logistics company, we have to follow and listen to the voices of both businesses and customers and provide the best solutions. Today, we are the only express logistics company with a warehouse at Tangier airport.</p><p><strong>What are the most important sources of revenue for DHL here?<br></strong>In Morocco, B2B is still the dominant contributor to our revenue at more than 80%. Our different offers suit the market's needs and our customers' portfolios are rich and varied—wherever we can have additional revenue we will operate and offer our services. We serve the automotive, aeronautic, banking and financial, textiles, handy-crafts, and logistics sectors. We are here to answer to market needs whether it is B2B or B2C. We have invested in many cities and regions from north to south and we are happy to offer our services at 20 service points and express centers.</p><p><strong>Will e-commerce grow further in Morocco?<br></strong>Over the last few years, e-commerce in Morocco on both the import and export sides has grown. As a compliant company, we are working hand-in-hand with the local authorities to ease the flow of inbound e-commerce shipments. The world today is more oriented toward digitalization, and e-commerce is seen as the digital market for today and the future. With the recent upgrade of hard currency allowance, we can expect inbound e-commerce shipments to increase further. Another encouraging sign is the increase in the number of new start-ups. We are ready to serve and support this growing business by giving advice based on our global experience. During the lockdown, we worked hand-in-hand with our customers and are proud to participate in their growth. We have seen many clients shift to e-commerce, which has helped them not only survive during the lockdown but also sustain a healthy growth for the future. As a logistics company, we have to listen to the market, and for the time being B2C is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.</p><p><strong>How will the digital revolution change the market in Morocco?<br></strong>Our daily challenge is to make our customers' lives better and easier by giving them the ability to manage and access information immediately. Digital revolution is giving—and will continue to give—a positive push to the market. The parallel side of digitalization is robotics, and DHL has three innovation centers around the world. The last one opened in the US in 2020. We aim to provide our customers with the newest technology available, delivering excellence in a digital world.</p><p><strong>What measures did you take to win the best employer </strong><strong>award?<br></strong>It is definitely a challenge to be top employer for three years in a row. It is even more challenging to sustain this recognition and improve our employees' lives. We are looking for excellence through different programs and will continuously work every year, month, week, and day to make sure today is better than yesterday. Our workforce is our main differentiator; it gives us the power to deliver the best quality to our customers.</p><p><strong>What have been your efforts regarding sustainability?<br></strong>So far, we have helped needy students under the Go Teach program, we delivered IT materials to NGOs during the lockdown, and we refurbished a public school. Under the Go Help program, we engage in no less than 20 activities every year. Being a part of DPDHL makes us all an engaged company in green practices. We participated in the Formula-e Marrakesh, where we worked closely with a local NGO to clean the environment.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>The main goal in 2020 is to ensure the safety of our employees, shipments, premises, and customers. We will continue to take care of our employees, focus on great quality, listen to our customers, and make sure we are their first choice whenever they think about logistics. In Morocco, we will continue to invest in people and infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>When did CBRE enter the Moroccan market?<br></strong>CBRE is the global leader in real estate services, with 480 offices worldwide. The goal behind the company's expansion into Morocco in 2005 was to strengthen its large geographic coverage and support global corporate clients in their investment strategy. CBRE started by offering its core services, such as valuation, advisory, and transaction, but it soon introduced other complementary services such as property and project management.</p><p><strong>What is CBRE's main strategy in Morocco?<br></strong>We are focused on quality over quantity, as the revenue of CBRE Morocco is limited compared to its global revenue. In terms of valuation, we observe the rules of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveys, and for every report and valuation we undertake the same processes one would find in the UK or elsewhere in Europe. Sometimes, this is not required by local regulation, but we do it because we follow international valuation standards.</p><p><strong>Are you expanding in other regional countries?<br></strong>Our current strategy is to consolidate our position in Morocco by focusing on the quality of our services and standards. Our standards and service quality are key to everything. The second step is growth, as Casablanca is currently the hub of North and West Africa. Our goal is to continue to increase our exposure in other regional markets.</p><p><strong>Is Morocco attractive for international investors interested in real estate? <br></strong>International investors looking to expand in an emerging market will look mainly at offices and retail. The property yields of these markets need to be attractive enough to compensate for the investment risk. Over the past few years, we have seen a fall in property yields in Europe, North America, and Asia. Therefore, investors are starting to look at emerging markets, searching for better returns. When looking for investment-grade countries in Africa, they will only find five or six, with Morocco being in the top two. When you buy a prime fully let office building in Casablanca, you can get a yield of 8-8.5%. In Western Europe, the highest office yields are around 4.25% which is normal given the expected return and risk in emerging countries. Morocco offers an incredible opportunity to international investors. They just need to the assistance of professional advisors with strong local knowledge. Morocco has promulgated the legal framework for real estate investment trusts (OPCI). This new regulated investment vehicle will help increase market liquidity and attract capital flow from institutional investors and individuals.</p><p><strong>How has the residential real estate market evolved since CBRE's arrival in Morocco?<br></strong>Before 2008, we had boom years with multiple projects and strong sales. Then, we faced the global economic turmoil of 2008, which had an indirect impact on the real estate sector. In fact, demand for high-grade properties, mainly in Marrakesh and Tangier, declined. This was not necessarily a bad thing as it helped the market mature. As a result, only professionally structured players are able to compete. Therefore, this was not a crisis as such, but a restructuring of the sector. At present, we are facing the challenges of oversupply in some residential areas and strong competition among developers.</p><p><strong>What could be done to increase attractiveness for international investors?<br></strong>Numerous adjustments such as tax incentives and the easing of dividend repatriation were made over the past year to ease the route of international investors to Morocco. We still need to ease the experience for investors by having a clear path to investment, where they can access consolidated and up-to-date market-related data. For example, in the absence of data on office transactions in Casablanca, we had to gather market information to consolidate market data. These are the initiatives we have been taking to facilitate access to market knowledge.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>You were recently included on the Casablanca Stock Exchange's ELITE program. What pushed your company to </strong><strong>be a part of it?<br></strong>It is a choice that was made by the stock exchange. The program takes place over two years; the first year is about training the managers and the second is about focusing on a specific subject, such as strategy or governance. This, of course, depends on the type of company. We are in our first year and have undergone the technical training part. Once we have successfully completed the second phase, we look forward to exploring the different types of financing options that the stock exchange will present to us.</p><p><strong>How has your experience so far been?<br></strong>We have completed the first module, which we found really interesting. Notably, there was a set of companies that are about the same size as us. What is important is the exchange between all the managers. Overall, our experience was great; the framework, supervision, and training were all of the highest standards. </p><p><strong>Do you have plans to expand into more markets?<br></strong>At present, we are operating in five African countries. We have a real development strategy for the future of Africa. Since Morocco is our country of origin, we are present here and are developing our local activities and presence. One of our main targets is the health sector. We have carried out a few projects, including the first oncology center in Mauritania, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso, an emergency hospital in Mauritania, and a clinic in Abidjan. Recently, we had a turnkey contract including medical equipment for a hospital in Burkina Faso. It has been a fruitful experience so far, and we plan to develop it further. Africa represents between 15 and 20% of our total turnover. There are more opportunities in Africa than Morocco because the competition in Morocco is getting tough. With this in mind, we are targeting the African market for expansion. That said, we intend to continue our expansion in Morocco. Our turnover from the Moroccan market grows 20% every year on average.</p><p><strong>What makes Morocco such a competitive market?<br></strong>Morocco has developed significantly over the last 20 years. There are a few national companies that have become leaders, even international leaders. There was a time when Moroccan companies were not capable of building highways or dams, but at present they can handle any kind of project.</p><p><strong>What has been the impact of digitalization on your business?<br></strong>Digitalization has had an enormous impact on our business. CMM is leveraging digitalization to develop our internal programs and keep them up to date.</p><p><strong>What impact has payment delays had on your operations?<br></strong>Payment delays are a national nuisance. A company that is not paid on time cannot be expected to invest. We have found our way around this challenge because of our healthy cash flow, allowing us to continue to honor our commitments to suppliers and collaborators. Almost 80% of the dividends remain within the company. On a national level, the government is working with all stakeholders and relevant authorities to fight this problem. The laws were always there, but they were never enforced. Fortunately, the government is now applying penalties in the event of late payments.</p><p><strong>How do you train your workforce?<br></strong>We train our employees about new methods and techniques. For the technical team, we mainly hire fresh graduates and give them on-the-job training. One project manager can train two to three technicians at a time.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic objectives for 2020?<br></strong>Our primary goal is to maintain our growth and explore other countries in Africa. We have a number of projects in the pipeline. We also participate in calls for tenders. For example, we took part in an Afri Santé exhibition in Ivory Coast. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ménara Holding recently established operations in Ivory Coast. What is the group's strategy regarding Africa?<br></strong>We had a strategic expansion plan at the national level that was based on a five-year plan focused on basic trade. We decided to continue our expansion on an international level to prepare ourselves for this sub-Saharan adventure. In 2019, we decided to create two branches in Ivory Coast as part of our expansion plan. We have also confirmed our presence in Morocco as a model to follow in the construction industry, particularly in prefabricated, ready-mixed concrete, transport, and other activities, which allow us to have a strong business model. The idea is to adapt this model to seize more opportunities at the sub-Saharan level, starting with Ivory Coast, which will be Ménara's hub. Our ambition is to be present in Ivory Coast through our core business, which is the installation of prefabricated factories and all things quarrying. Sub-Saharan Africa and Africa in general is an economic market that has a great orientation at the international level, so there are opportunities.</p><p><strong>How do you evaluate the outcome of the group's 2016-20 strategic vision?<br></strong>The balance sheet in general is positive. We are currently the national benchmark in terms of capacity, presence, and turnover. Several structuring investment projects that are part of the vision have achieved 90% of their objectives. The loss of our founder had an impact at the beginning, but we were able to preserve continuity and put in place a succession plan that was worked out well in advance, thanks to the clear-sightedness of the president. Currently, we are in the process of consolidating this plan by 2020, as there is another road to travel throughout the year. Generally, despite the construction sector's poor growth, the group has been able to achieve growth. This is important because the ecosystem of construction and building since 2016 has been stagnant, particularly in Marrakesh. We have grown over 25% during this time.</p><p><strong>What are the group's main objectives for the next five years?<br></strong>Our objectives lie on two main axes: a possible IPO of the group's main branch, Ménara Préfa; and an operational presence in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, our ambition is to be present in other regions in Morocco. With this 2021-2025 vision, if we want to maintain our position as leaders, it is vital that we always innovate and reposition ourselves in the market through an<br>integrated solution. We aim to not only focus on product innovation, but also on service, quality, digital, human, and financial aspects.</p><p><strong>What is your evaluation of the building and public works sector in Morocco?<br></strong>Unfortunately, in the construction sector, there are some risks. Some work is being done at the moment, but it remains among the sectors that are under-supervised. There is also the informal sector, which brings in unfair competition. Investing in CSR and innovation is still a huge cost for the group, and not all operators have the same spirit. But I remain optimistic because there are projects in the Agadir region that are open, and there is a willingness to structure and develop this sector. We are working with other companies in the sector that have the same objectives and the same orientation in terms of fair competition and development, because it is through these values that Morocco can climb the ladder and evolve.</p><p><strong>Ménara Préfa represents 70% of the group. Are youlooking into more diversification?<br></strong>At present, we will stay the way we are. Ménara Préfa is the locomotive; it is the flagship company of the group and, in terms of strategic evolution, we are integrating all innovation into Ménara Préfa. There is another pole we are developing in real estate, but, for the moment, Ménara Préfa will remain the engine.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Could you give us an overview of FNM and Manafid Al Houboub?<br></strong>I have an industrial unit that makes flours from tender wheat. I also chair the FNM, which comprises about 160 units of soft wheat, hard wheat, and barley. The flour milling sector has been suffering from production overcapacity for more than a decade. This leads to unfair and blind competition between the different operators. Each follows their own strategy, and this has repercussions on prices and margins. Within the federation, we are working with the government on a strategy to restructure the sector and redeploy resources. In 1988, there were about 60 millers, whereas today there are more than 138 soft wheat millers. Today, we are calling for the subsidy system to be redeployed by means of direct aid to the marginalized, so that transparency and competitiveness can thrive. We are working hard to restructure the entire sector, from seed production to processing and secondary processing. We are currently in the process of putting in place a strategic plan for global supply. With COVID-19, the weaknesses in the system became clear. With two consecutive years of drought in 2019 and 2020, we were dependent on imports of common wheat, hard wheat, barley, and corn from Europe, Russia, the US, and others. Then, there was a problem with congestion at some ports, and all this caused problems and created a sense of frustration and panic. Fortunately, we made all the arrangements given our geographical location and were able to catch up quickly. We must now work on a global approach with an agreement on when we will suspend imports and work on national production. This will help us use our port facilities more intelligently, optimize the cost of transport between ports and the various units, buy when world prices are at their lowest, and no longer be subject to the hazards of the world market and the vagaries of the climate. We are now on the cusp of a major change in the entire sector in Morocco that would integrate all the components of this value chain. All this sums up what is happening in our sector and gives an idea of how we see the future in 2021 and 2022.</p><p><strong>In December 2019, the government announced it would spend MAD14 billion on subsidies for wheat, cooking gas, and sugar. How will this plan change with COVID-19?</strong><br>A COVID-19 fund was created and financed by the state with the participation of all social components, so the subsidies on products that are typically subsidized will continue. In terms of gas subsidies, everyone benefits, from farmers who use gas bottles to industrialists who use butane. The state cannot continue to subsidize populations who are in comfortable situations to the detriment of poorer ones. We want this aid to be direct and the market price to reflect the real price. Today, a 13-kg gas canister is MAD40 while the actual price is MAD120, so the difference could very well go to the people in difficult situations. The same applies to sugar, as it is used by those who produce soft drinks, bakeries, and restaurants. The state cannot continue to subsidize everyone.</p><p><strong>What are your priorities for 2021?<br></strong>The priority is to restart activity, as COVID-19 has put a large number of industrialists to the test. The state has taken many measures, like loans with interest rates less than 3.5%. 2021 will be a difficult year, so we should expect a restart in 2022. The priorities will be to ensure social peace, employment, and restarting activity in a flexible, smooth, and trouble-free manner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has FENIP evolved since its creation in 1996, and what have been its main areas of </strong><strong>intervention?<br></strong>FENIP is a sectoral professional organization that represents the transformation of the sector and valuation of seafood products in Morocco. Its main goals are to represent and defend the interests of its members; study specific measures to develop industries for the processing of fishery products and improve the conditions of production, distribution and sale of products; and provide its members with any assistance likely to promote and develop their activities. FENIP's efforts aim to increase awareness of the quality and diversity of the Moroccan product and strengthen the country's competitive position in the international market. The seafood processing industries sector comprises seven branches of activity, six of which are represented in professional organizations that are members of FENIP: the semi-canned fish industry represented by AMASCOP; the fish meal and oil industry represented by ANAFAP; on land freezing of seafood represented by ANICOM; the packaging and export of fresh fish represented by APROMER; all the seafood processing industries in Agadir represented by FIPROMER (the regional branch of FENIP); the canned fish industry represented by UNICOP; and the seaweed processing industry (AGAR AGAR), an associate member.</p><p><strong>How has the outbreak of COVID-19 affected the fish industry in Morocco?<br></strong>In the context of the pandemic and similar to other sectors of the national economy, the local fishing industries sector has faced a disruption in international supply and demand. Many seafood processing units found themselves in a situation of virtual inactivity. In addition, the few production units still operational have put in place preventive measures in<br>order to minimize the risks of contagion. All these measures have had a strong impact on productivity. Thanks to the measures to support the productive sector advocated by His Majesty the King, we are now witnessing a gradual recovery of<br>the fishing industry sector. </p><p><strong>What have been FENIP's main initiatives and areas of work due to COVID-19 to protect the interests of its members?<br></strong>From the start of the health crisis, FENIP shared with the Economic Watch Committee set up by His Majesty the King recommendations from our members for measures for the sector. A team was also set up to remain attentive to the needs of<br>professionals. FENIP and its member associations insisted on resuming coastal fishing and ensured compliance with the<br>necessary health measures. In addition, FENIP closely monitors developments in the seafood sector nationally and internationally in the context of COVID-19 and regularly informs its members. The federation has appointed a representative from among its members in each province where value-added fishery activities are present. These representatives are the single point of contact for local authorities and the team set up to fight the pandemic. Their role is to provide accurate information relating to the measures taken by the establishments, ensure the functioning of their various departments, and facilitate communication with companies. </p><p><strong>In 2019, local fish consumption exceeded 12kg per person annually, and there were estimates that by the end of 2020, Morocco could exceed the government target of 16kg. Is this still a doable target?<br></strong>If the national consumption of fish per capita is still low in Morocco, it is mainly because of the unavailability of an appropriate cold chain to allow the transport and storage of fresh fish in different regions of Morocco. The Halieutis Plan makes it possible in part to remedy this problem through the creation of fish markets in the main cities of the country; however, this is far from sufficient to make fish accessible everywhere in the country. Also, it is important to promote the national consumption of processed seafood products, in particular authentic Moroccan sardines Sardina pilchardus Walbaum. Thanks to its remarkable nutritional properties, Sardina pilchardus is an excellent source of protein and Omega 3 recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been some of your short-term strategies to tackle COVID-19, and how has it impacted your operations?<br></strong>I do not manage the operational side of the subsidiaries. I manage the corporate part and the shareholders. Overall, COVID-19 has had two significant impacts. First, it has impacted some developing parts such as Virgin and Kiabi, which are not dedicated to food distribution. We are developing Virgin for cultural products, Kiabi for textiles, and Burger King for fast food. Like many companies in the world, we experienced a complete halt of all activity. On the other hand, our food distribution line embodied by Carrefour is experiencing the opposite; we are facing a customer rush. In the last 10 days, our turnover has been about 25-30% superior compared to the same period in 2019 despite the restrictions and obstacles in the supply chain.</p><p><strong>Are you confident about the smooth running of the organization?<br></strong>Today, all development projects are at a standstill. Our first axis is about food distribution and Carrefour, the second has to do with all other subsidiaries that are at a standstill, and the third is about our development projects. Overall, for the first axis, we are trying to overcome three major difficulties: sanitary hardships, HR, and supply chain. We are a franchise of a large international group, and this entails maintaining international standards. This is most important for supermarket employees, especially cashiers and specialty workers handling fresh products. We have taken several sanitary measures in line with international standards and protocols. On the HR side, we are facing psychological difficulties, time management, transport issues, confinement, mail delays, surveillance, and so on. These are fairly complicated, though we seek to work hand in hand with the local authorities in each city. We must not forget that we serve the public interest. The local and national authorities grant us many privileges and support us in keeping our stores running. In terms of supply chain, we have enough stock to last several months, though not for all products. We are experiencing significant difficulties in terms of local production and imports.</p><p><span></span><strong>In terms of human resources, are you working at full capacity?<br></strong>Carrefour is operating at full capacity. We are even trying to bring in additional resources from the group. We do so on a case-by-case basis depending on the challenges faced by each store. </p><p><strong><span></span>How is the group embracing digitalization?<br></strong>We have two strategic projects underway across the group: a CSR project and a digitalization project. Each subsidiary is now working with its parent company to maximize the digitalization of loyalty products, internet access, sales, and so on. Each city has its area of competence that defines its overall strategic project.</p><p><strong>What is the strategy of the group for 2021?<br></strong>2020 started really well for all of the subsidiaries, including Burger King, Virgin, Kiabi, and Carrefour. Most likely, Carrefour will have a good year. For the others, we also expect a positive year. If COVID-19 lasts longer, we will have to revise our accounts and estimate our losses. Carrefour is supporting the national effort with a MAD50-million contribution to the Moroccan COVID-19 fund.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fresher than fresh]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fresher-than-fresh]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the company?<br></strong>We operate in the retail space under three banners. Additionally, we have a real estate business, taking our number of main divisions to four. The first division is called Marjane, under which we have 40 hypermarkets in Morocco. The second is supermarkets, called Marjane Market, and we have 42 in the country. The final division is electronic supplies, which has 28 Electroplanet home appliance stores. Regarding our real estate business, we are number one in retail. We have shopping malls, commercial parks, and hypermarkets and markets. Our business began with one hypermarket called Marjane at the end of the 1980s. Between 2002 and 2007, Marjane had a venture with French retailer Auchan. The Moroccan shareholder purchased the shares of Auchan, and it is now 100% owned by Moroccan shareholders. We had a major change in our business around 2014, when we decided to get rid of our alcohol business. It was a huge decision for us because it represented around 25% of our net margin. We have been recovering for the past few years, thoughnow we are doing well.</p><p><strong>What are your future expansion plans?<br></strong>We are growing with the level of urbanization across the country. We follow the trend of the country, and though we have a focus on high and middle classes, we remain strong in democratizing products for all, especially in the non-food business. </p><p><strong>How have the spending patterns of Moroccans changed, considering that GDP is growing but purchasing power remains largely the same?</strong><br>If Moroccan society can be broken into five tiers, tiers A and B represent around 60% of our sales. Meanwhile, A, B, and C account for around 85- 90%. The big challenge is making sure these macroeconomic changes translate into micro changes. This means we need to ensure development positively impacts all levels of society. The various tiers of society are facing new costs and challenges, and we have to make sure each tier is able to develop and grow. People in lower tiers are focused on spending more on things like education. This means they are consuming cheaper food items. On the other hand, the upper tiers are consuming high-quality food items. We see strong growth in these areas. We have made huge changes in terms of the quality of the goods we offer, thanks to a focus on added value. People of all social tiers recognize and appreciate this value. Moroccans are now looking for quality in their food much more than before, when they were more focused on price. Starting from 2017, we have seen our brand equity increase significantly. We are far ahead of our closest competitor.</p><p><strong>What is your approach to organic food?<br></strong>We are talking about health and wellness a great deal. Healthy and organic food is essential. Organic food has huge demand, but we have to be careful of those offering organic products that are not actually organic. There are many other ways of looking at healthy food. We decided to focus on areas like freshness across our product lines. We have developed a method for controlling the entire supply chain of our products to ensure they are of the highest quality. We are also focused on natural production techniques that require fewer chemicals. Under the Sélection Marjane banner, we offer a range of healthy fresh products thanks to strong partnerships with local producers and farmers.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>We want to continue with the strategy we developed in 2017. We want to focus more on fresh products, which means sourcing quality products from all over the world. We are doing market research all over the world, including local high-quality products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the university adapt to COVID-19?<br></strong>When COVID-19 emerged, Morocco quickly took strong and proactive actions to manage an unprecedented crisis, under the direct supervision and leadership of His Majesty the King. Euromed took various measures and actions for our students and society. First, we implemented close to 100% distance learning for all our programmes. Notably, with help from the EU, we provided new computers and 4G internet sticks with one-year subscriptions to 530 students from rural areas and low-income families. We also acted to take care of our foreign students. We sterilize the dormitories, hand out PPE equipment, and provide packed lunches, drinks, and other items. We also offer psychological counseling when needed. As for society, our staff has voluntarily donated part of or entire one-month salaries to the national fund for the management of COVID-19. Second, we have produced thousands of protective visors and donated them to hospitals and regional administrations. We have also developed washable, sterilizable, and reusable plastic masks with homemade filters that comply with international medical requirements.The masks are manufactured by our 3D printing facilities. We have developed a new respirator valve and a new air-flow meter in our university in collaboration with doctors from Rabat. We have also developed an application for tracking COVID-19. Our university has been extremely active during this period of containment and confinement. We are doingour best to take care of our staff and students, and we are strongly committed to technological projects that are of help to society.</p><p><strong>UEMF offers a wide range of programmes. Which ones are the most popular?<br></strong>In September 2019, we opened a new engineering school, the first of its kind in Europe and Africa: a five-year engineering school completely dedicated to AI. We have concluded several agreements with various universities from the two shores of the Mediterranean. Presently, we have nine entities, three faculties, three engineering schools (mechanical engineering, civil engineering, IT engineering, biomedical, and AI engineering), a school of architecture, a school of business, and an institute of law and political sciences. In September, we will open a faculty of pharmacy. UEMF offers world-class bachelor's, master's, and PhD programmes.</p><p><strong>UEMF has several partnerships with foreign universities. What is your strategy in this regard?<br></strong>Our strategy is to act as a platform that bridges, from educational and cultural viewpoints, the two realms of the Mediterranean. We have strong collaborations and partnerships with universities and research institutions from across the world. For example, we were expecting to receive some students from Stanford University in 2020 but unfortunately, this had to be postponed due to COVID-19.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about your eco-campus?<br></strong>From the beginning, the campus sought to be an eco-campus that got the labeling from COP22. We have included several sustainable technologies, with the objective to be energy sufficient, consume minimal water, and go solar. Some of the technologies we use are highly insulating materials, photovoltaic and thermal solar devices, and water recycling systems. The design of the buildings was inspired by the ancestral know-how of the city of Fes.</p><p><strong>How would you rate the Moroccan educational sector?<br></strong>In the last five years, we have witnessed an important expansion, with a wide choice of universities including public universities, not-for-profit universities, and private universities. The number of students has also tripled. This brings various challenges, such as ensuring a true digital transition in universities. Second, we have to design career-oriented programmes as well as proactive programmes. It is also of high importance to revise the 01-00 law governing the higher education system. To comply with international standards, Moroccan universities should also open more to the diaspora and international students. Finally, a true assurance quality system should be implemented in universities with a top-down and bottom-up assessment and evaluation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your assessment of the tourism sector and of the hotel industry in Morocco?<br></strong>The tourism sector in Morocco is under development. We have Marrakesh, a destination that has been chosen<br>among the top-10 destinations worldwide. There are also new areas such as Taghazout and Dakhla, which are gaining momentum quickly. As for hotels, there are plenty of new properties being constructed in Rabat, Casablanca, Marrakesh, and Tangier.</p><p><strong>How did 2019 compare to the year before, andwhat has changed in terms of trends?<br></strong>The first five months of 2019 were good for Marrakesh, Agadir, and Rabat, but it slowed down toward the third quarter. On the other hand, Casablanca had a slow start in 2019. Growth has declined mainly due to new openings and bad performance of other sectors, such as real estate and agriculture.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest challenges in the sector that Mövenpick Hotel Casablanca has successfully overcome to maintain its position within the hotel industry?</strong><br>The biggest challenge is to continuously update the property to meet the demanding requirements of customers and keep in close contact with guests to understand their needs. </p><p><strong>Serving both business and leisure travelers, how do you position Mövenpick Hotel within the hospitality market?<br></strong>Mövenpick Casablanca is oriented toward business travelers during weekdays, with a daily presence of local seminars. Over weekends and during the summer, we host the leisure segment in addition to several airline crews as well.</p><p><strong>What are your unique offerings? How can people utilize your premises for business or special events?<br></strong>Mövenpick Casablanca has a unique location, centrally located between the headquarters of major banks and next to the head office of major multinational organizations. Apart from an amazing sky bar rooftop with a pool, Mövenpick Casablanca offers a central location that is in close proximity to famous markets and cafes.</p><p><strong>How are increasing innovations in technology affecting the hospitality industry and your operations?<br></strong>We have succeeded in acquiring the latest technology in Wi-Fi and internet-enabled TV. At present, we are working on putting an iPad in each room. Guests will be able to use the iPad to order room service, control the room's lights, and operate the TV.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the future?<br></strong>With new openings in Morocco, and especially in Casablanca, we expect the competition to be furious. Moving forward, all hotels will need to concentrate on updating their infrastructure and improving guest satisfaction rates to retain their loyalty.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main achievements of Four Seasons Hotel Casablanca over the last four years?<br></strong>Opening and establishing the first luxury hotel in the city has definitely been the key achievement for us over these last few years. More importantly, our unique oceanfront location has also allowed us to tap into the leisure segment, which has always been overlooked in Casablanca. The city has become a major gateway for Africa and Europe, attracting tourists from around the world as well as being an economic hub for business. Previously, leisure travelers preferred to visit cities like Marrakesh and Fes over Casablanca due to the absence of a luxury hotel. We used this as an opportunity to capture a larger share of the leisure market. We have received positive feedback from our corporate clients, the majority of whom are international, as well as local companies that choose our property over other hotels because of the Four Seasons service.</p><p><strong>How would you evaluate the state of tourism in Casablanca?<br></strong>Casablanca has great potential as a tourism hub. The government realizes this and is upgrading the airport and looking to attract airlines from around the world. Morocco is well connected to Europe, the Americas, the GCC, and Asia, especially China, which has recently become a strategic market for us because of the visa-free program launched by the two countries. As of June 2019, Morocco received 8 million visitors, marking an 8% increase YoY. Marrakesh and Agadir are driving the growth, but other cities are also improving their offerings. The leisure sector in Morocco is strong, and this has helped both the country and cities like Casablanca unlock the full potential of the tourism sector.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about your average client profile?<br></strong>We have two major categories of guests: leisure and business. The majority of our leisure guests come from the US, Canada, and China. The GCC is our third-biggest market, mainly Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain. Our business travelers are primarily from Europe, specifically France. The hotel is equipped with all the necessary facilities to cater to all kinds of guests throughout the year.</p><p><strong>What is Four Seasons' added value?<br></strong>Our location, service, and our unique F&amp;B offerings are our main differentiators. Moreover, the design of the hotel also stands out. We are one of the few hotels in the city with a prime oceanfront location. Both leisure guests and locals enjoy our services and facilities, whether having lunch at our signature restaurant Bleu, afternoon tea in our lobby Mint, or a luxurious treatment at our spa. We have an extraordinary location just a few minutes from the city center, which allows both our leisure and business guests to disconnect from the rest of the world and relax in our garden oasis.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for the future?<br></strong>We continue to look at expanding our footprint in the leisure segment in key markets such as North America, the GCC, Europe, and China, as well as other emerging markets in Latin America, capitalizing on new airlifts from these markets. We will continue to invest in marketing to grow in other markets by participating in trade shows to showcase our unique offerings. An increase in hotel offerings in the city and a revitalized airport will attract more tourists in the future. The government is undertaking a number of ambitious initiatives, which will bring new opportunities in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>There has been a shift in demand in the tourism sector. How would you define this shift?<br></strong>Indeed, this shift has taken place both in the business and the leisure segment, but more so in leisure. The shift in demand is mainly related to digitalization. From our side, our position has always been to show our clients “Morocco through our eyes" in a tailor-made manner. We are always opening up new authentic and interactive experiences to encourage people to understand our country, rather than going on a strictly touristic path. We have observed this shift in demand, and we have found it to be positive because it better emphasizes our real value as experts of the destination. When we do our sales calls in the different markets we target, we show this expertise. We explain there is much more to see behind a medina or a mosque. Even in the last few years, despite the slowdown in the country, there was great growth. Between 2017 and 2019, we experienced double-digit growth.</p><p><strong>What services weigh more in terms of revenue?<br></strong>MICE and business travel represent 70% of our business, but leisure is growing. We are opening the leisure part, and the line between business and leisure is less clear now. When you organize a congress, some people will ask for extensions to make it into a vacation. People really appreciate our approach because it is different than just selling a typical packaged product. We make people interact with the country, and people are taken to lesser known places that are more authentic. Sometimes, we create something new for the MICE segment and then adapt it to our high-end leisure groups and individuals or vice versa.</p><p><strong>What is your average client's profile?<br></strong>We are a B2B company; we rarely work with individuals directly. Most of our clients come from our business partners and our representative agents. Our local business is more B2B, so we work with corporations to manage their accounts.</p><p><strong>One of the challenges of the country is to sell this added value. What is your view on this?<br></strong>Our market is global, and currently destinations are in competition with each other. Morocco must establish a unique selling proposition that will differentiate it from other destinations. It is important to show that Morocco is diverse. For example, we have one of the best windsurfing spots in the world. Marrakesh is the most touristic city in Morocco, and it still has so many hidden gems. Overall, in order to sell our entire offerings, we need the adequate infrastructure around it.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>Historically, we have had mostly a business travel focus, since we work with many corporations. Now, we are focusing more on bringing tourists to Morocco, so it will be a similar strategy for 2020. We are present in the US, Mexico, most of Europe, the Middle East, Russia, and other regions through our partners. Now, we are trying to develop more and find out more about these markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main outcomes of the Tourism Marketing Days event?<br></strong>In Morocco, the tourism industry plays a crucial role, as it is a key sector. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), more than 750,000 people are employed in the tourism industry. The Moroccan Tourism Marketing Days aimed to share the vision of the Moroccan National Tourist Office (ONMT) and industry leaders. The event was an opportunity to share our strategies concerning countries where we should consolidate our presence, such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy. We also identified future potential markets in China and North America. In January 2020, we launched our first direct flight from Casablanca to Beijing. In North America, we have direct flights to Miami, Washington D.C., New York, Montreal, and Boston. In the meantime, we must consolidate our core market with new flights to Morocco. Thanks to a decision made by the Moroccan government in 2008 with Europe, all European airlines can land in Morocco without authorization, and the same goes for Royal Air Maroc in Europe. Morocco has 3,500km of beaches along the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts. We also have beautiful landscapes, welcoming people, an outstanding desert, and amazing hospitality. In 2019, we reached 13 million tourists and USD8 billion in revenue. Moving forward, we should further promote the cities of Fes, Rabat, Tangier, the Mediterranean coast, and the south. The Tourism Marketing Days focused on domestic tourism as well, which accounts for more than 30% of occupancy in official hotels. Digitalization and human capital are two other key points we discussed.</p><p><strong>What are the challenges preventing Morocco from reaching its full tourism potential?<br></strong>We need to increase our foreign-language skills, service quality, and hospitality. Furthermore, we need to adapt our attitudes to clients coming from the global village. We also spoke about quality, domestic tourism, MICE events, golf, and even cinema, as many movies are filmed here. Robert Redford earlier came to Marrakesh, and he showed his appreciation on Twitter. That digital attention is worth more than publicity on CNN. We also have to ensure sustainable development to promote inclusive tourism.</p><p><strong>What has been the impact of digitalization on your company?<br></strong>B2B has been fantastic, while B2C has been more challenging. We are working on solutions to fix this, like our new application, where clients can find more than 400,000 hotels and flights. We have around 15 engineers working 24/7 to help us with this. B2B is a machine-to-machine business, and in 2020, we will be connected to one of the biggest providers of travel services in the world, located in China. It took six months for the engineers to connect the two systems. All the clients of this Chinese platform will be able to look at our products online and book instantly. Machine-to-machine connection, which is the third revolution of tourism, will have a positive impact on the industry.</p><p><strong>What does Morocco need to do to ensure the tourism sector is sustainable?<br></strong>If we can preserve the authenticity of our country and keep the right attitude, we will be able to provide a genuine experience, which will always be in demand. We must not forget the inclusive economy, and we must keep in mind that everyone has to have a slice of the cake. To this end, we need the government, regional authorities, and key decision makers to work together to facilitate stores, museums, and activities that can generate an income for all participants of the economy. We also have to work on a digital marketing approach. We must build a strong digital presence that covers the entire value chain. We need to invest more in human talent. If we can ensure that our people are trained and educated, growth and development will follow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business model been impacted by the pandemic, and what executive education trends have you witnessed?</h4><p>March was a tough month, with a big dip in sales of around 80% between March 10 and March 30. We were extremely worried; our company is all about scaling, and we wondered who would want to scale up at such a moment. We had internal conversations and reviewed our courses and realized there are many courses to help one be more agile and nimble, which is what companies need today. We decided to change the message and adapt our programs to help companies with what they need today. Today, we are having a record year and will end up with a 30% rise in profit, with 3Q2020 being our best in history in terms of revenue and profit. Another thing that was extremely important for us is that we have been telling our clients to do online education for the past eight years, but most wanted to pay three times more for us to come to them or attend a live event. Now, they have gotten used to being online, and we are pleased that our clients have gone from pure live to completely online. Our growth reflects people being more open to online education. Secondly, our tools and training are very much aligned with what is happening today.</p><h4>Do you predict that this spike in demand for online education will remain long term?</h4><p>General online education was growing at 16% per year before the pandemic and now there are predictions it will grow up to 26% per year even after the pandemic. We will see a spike that will come down slightly, though the trend will be at least twice as fast as before. Adoption of online education has advanced by five years in just three months. I have been using Zoom for five years, for example, and people were just hearing about it in March for the first time; it shows that many were unaware of such tools.</p><h4>What is the main idea and objectives behind your Four Decisions methodology?</h4><p>Verne Harnish is the co-founder of the Growth Institute and author of the book Scaling Up, which covers the four decisions that all entrepreneurs need to make. The subtitle of the book is how a few companies make it, and why the rest do not. Of all the companies around the world, 96% of the ones that survive earn more than USD1 million in revenue, but in Mexico 96% of companies earn less than USD500,000. It is important to emphasize that we do not have a start-up problem as in 2019, 11,000 start-ups were started every hour around the world, but we do have a scale up problem. I have coached entrepreneurs who have owned a business for 20 years with an income hovering around USD500,000. Many end up wondering if they would have been better off being an employee of a company than an entrepreneur after weighing the levels of stress their investments have created. Ultimately, you should not start a company if it is not scalable. The caveat is having a lifestyle business that generates USD100,000 and allows the owner to live wherever they want and work whenever they want; however, if you are going to have a company with employees, you need to go above USD1 million. The Four Decisions are those that business owners have to get right to scale past a million.</p><h4>What advice would you have for someone to envision scaling up?</h4><p>The biggest issue in Latin America is that we create companies that do not have the capacity to scale assuming that there is no market to scale. This is a huge misunderstanding in the market. It is important to think outside of the box and find niche markets that are not being taken advantage of. There is a great deal of great training for start-ups and for Fortune 500 companies around the world; however, there is no training in the middle, as once a company is doing USD3 million or USD5 million of revenue, no one looks at them. This is the opportunity that we saw to scale up and double our revenue in the last three years.</p><h4>What market trends would you suggest executives in Mexico keep an eye on?</h4><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have said that having either access to or generating dollars will be extremely important, and I am helping many of my clients sell outside of Mexico to generate dollars. In the next five to 10 years, those companies that have a percentage of their revenue outside of the country will fare much better than the rest. There will be at least a five-to-10-year change of trends, as this is not a small financial crisis that will go back to normal. It is a profound cultural and political change and a reorganization of the world in many ways. We have a debt cycle in the world of 90 years, a social cycle of 40 years, a generational cycle of 90 years, and an economic cycle of 500 years, and they are all colliding today. We have a significant change in the structure of our society, and those businesses that can generate revenue not dependent on one country will fare the best. For example, in the Growth Institute we have clients in 68 countries around the world. We have a varied portfolio of clients which means that if one country or region is in financial trouble, we will be compensated by the others while we continue to help many of our clients adapt their business models. The second is to go online and work remotely, which I have personally been doing for 12 years. Mexico is now the largest partner of the US, and if we take advantage of this we could double Mexico's GDP in the next five years. For example, if we take advantage of the US-China trade war, then the manufacturing that US companies are moving away from China can be located in Mexico.</p><h4>What upcoming programs do you have planned?</h4><p>We have the online Scaling Up Master Business Course that we teach every quarter as well as a program called Tribes, which is a group coaching program that lasts one year whereby we help companies implement all the scaling up in a virtual program with five or six other companies at a lower price than an ad-hoc consulting program. We then have individual consulting programs. In Mexico, we have been helping companies pivot or adapt their models to the new reality through our learning programs. We hold a Hot Seat in our programs where someone proposes a problem that they are having, and the other executives in the program help fix it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us an overview of Al Forsan Global Industrial Complex's latest achievements? </h4><p>For the last two years, we have been concentrating on being specified and approved for projects in Saudi Arabia. Now, many projects are going on that are government and private. We have been awarded several important contracts. The main is that we are supplying 5,800 villas for the National Guard. We're also supplying projects for ministry of housing and the Ministry of Interior's south border housing projects. We are classified as a technical factory. Unlike many other factories, we have been focusing on being approved by engineering consultants, contractors, and by ministries. Now we're considered a serious partner for any of those. Even during COVID-19, we haven't stopped our business; we continued to supply our clients and worked on our projects. We are happy with our progress as of today. More specifically, we have established new products. The most important product for us today is outdoor wall cladding. We have tiles that are 60cm x 120cm with 2cm thickness. They can be fixed on outdoor facades with mechanical fixing that would normally be used to fix granite and marble. We have started getting a lot of projects using these tiles, especially the mall on King Abdulaziz Road and other projects in Mecca and Riyadh. We also have 40cm x 80cm tiles that can be used in place of marble and granite, and it's very interesting now. It's a new product on the market. We have also established an antibacterial glaze for our tiles, good for schools, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, and so on. We are the only company producing that type of tile and it prevents any bacteria from growing on tiles. This is done through a special formula that we produced independently. At present, we are developing new models for export to the UK. We saw good exports in 2016-2018, and we have renewed those contracts to develop a new series for the UK. These will be in the same sanitary segment, and we expect 20% of our production to be exported to the UK.</p><h4>Do you have other export destinations and what kind of projects are you involved in through your partners?</h4><p>We are now exporting to about 16 countries. Since COVID-19, we have not been able to export, but prior to this year it was about 75% local and 25% of our products were shipped abroad. The UK is our largest export market, followed by Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, Yemen, and Italy. We are renewing our contracts in Italy for sanitary ware. I expect that in 2021 we will be back to around 50% of our products being exported. With Aramco, they are working on housing projects for which we supply. We also supply Emaar. We supplied material for the housing projects of the Royal Commission and the Ministry of Defense. With all of our partners, we supply housing projects, in addition to several hotels we have provided for in Mecca and Medina, mainly porcelain tiles and sanitary ware. In shopping malls, all of the flooring is porcelain. We are producing the same style as you might see in the Mall of Arabia, for example.</p><h4>How were you able to maintain operations since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p>We started by asking all of our employees to stay inside our compound; we have our own canteens and everything they might need. Anyone who does go in or out has their temperature checked. We try not to let those who have been outside mix with those inside. We have been supplying in that way.</p><h4>How do you see the Saudi Arabian market changing in the wake of the coronavirus?</h4><p>Personally, I believe it's not that much different from a normal influenza. Up until now, there were 200,000 deaths from COVID-19 worldwide, but in 2019, around 600,000 people died from the normal flu. It's my opinion that the exaggeration of this pandemic is benefiting some industries who want to sell products at an expensive price. I believe that the Saudi Arabian market will continue booming over the next 30-40 years. The population has also been increasing by 700,000 people per year. The population of Muslims in general is increasing by about 150 million per year. As you know, every Muslim has a dream to visit Mecca and Medina. Imagine 150 million people every year adding to that pool. If just 2%, 3%, or 10% of them come to Saudi Arabia, imagine the impact. We have to reach a capacity of 30 million to 50 million visitors per year. For this, they will need construction. That's why I am very positive about the future. The Vision 2030 to be more economic and future thinking is in line with our leader's vision. I am in contact with many ministries, banks, investors, development funds and so on, and I really meet a lot of highly-qualified Saudi Arabians. Many of them are deep thinkers with deep knowledge, which is really creating a positive momentum within the country. Today, all of my top management are Saudi Arabian citizens. For the past two years I've been Saudizing everything; by the end of 2021, it will stand at about 90%. Many young people who have been working with me for four years or so have been promoted to sales managers or operational managers, even general managers and are very hardworking and very talented. This is very positive and one of the reasons I'm more confident about the country than I was in 2016, when we last met. When I arrived here, I did not know the situation; every time I met someone, they were a foreigner. Especially people who arrived 10 or 15 years ago had a clear idea that Saudi Arabians do not want to work. The main point was to employ them just to meet a quota. In the past five years, I have come to realize that that is not the case. As long as you hold them to a high standard, they will be able to do the job the same as any other person. I created a positive attitude within them. They saw that I was not considering them as employees, but as a part of their business. I can say my Saudi Arabian employees are exceeding my expectations. I keep them busy and they are very happy. Saudi Arabians by and large have very good intentions and work ethic. At present, we are at 70% Saudization and by the end of 2020 I hope it will be 85%. I want to retain the best employees, and today, hiring a foreign employee costs about the same as hiring a Saudi Arabian. In any case, being realistic—any foreigner in the country is here temporarily. They are often coming with the only purpose of making money. It's not a matter of loyalty. I am working to create loyalty among the Saudi Arabians that live around this area. I don't want them to have to drive more than 20 minutes; I want them to see their future here and a career here.</p><h4>What does Al Forsan do to be sustainable and protect the environment?</h4><p>We are in the ceramics industry. We use exclusively Italian technology that complies with European norms and standards. The authorities here are very strict on refuse, wastage, and fuels. Thankfully, we are doing extremely well in that regard. We employed nearly 12 consultants when building our compound, one for environmental impact, one for safety, and one for everything. That allowed us to take everything into account from the beginning.</p><h4>Are you planning to use more artificial intelligence and robotics in your operations?</h4><p>We have the latest technology here, but certain things must be done by people. Mixing of raw material, milling, printing, and loading may be automatic, but in between, you have to clean and maintain the equipment. Yes, it's highly automated already for three factories like ours—one for sanitary wares, one porcelain, and one ceramics. This complex would need 2,000 people working 25 years ago, but today we only need 1,000, including all the people in sales, staffing, and security.</p><h4>What are your short-term goals for the end of 2020 and the coming year?</h4><p>We plan to multiply and install a faucet factory. We want to build water taps since there is no factory like this in the area. We are looking for partnerships, specifically someone who wants to come and work with us here. I hope 2021 will be a better year than 2020. No one can predict that, but I do know one thing. The world will not stop turning. In 2008-2010, everyone was so sure the banking system would collapse and there would be a new world order. If you had talked to anyone at that time, you'd be depressed. But by 2012 everything was back on again and everything was booming. Generally speaking, our market will continue to grow even if there is no oil because we expect 30 million tourists to Mecca and Medina. There is very little risk. Moreover, there is a lot of wealth available in the world. It may change hands, but it will not reduce. Another hand will invest. I don't think the future will be bad, and it won't be worse. Behind every valley there is a mountain—after all the problems in the Middle East are resolved, they will need to rebuild. War cannot last forever, and people want to live. Since there are problems everywhere around us, we see that it will only get better in the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most significant effects of COVID-19 on the professional and lifelong learning education sector?</h4><p>When it comes to higher education and the adult education ecosystem, we have seen a new phenomenon, as people have had time on their hands as compared to being forced to move from offline to online. We internally think of this as a tailwind rather than an inflection point, as more people are now looking at learning online and are picking up education to help them improve their existing knowledge and skillsets. While people are looking at doing something online, they are also worried about their jobs and thus do not want to shell out a significant sum of money. We have seen a significant upside but believe this will last longer than the COVID-19 period itself for three key reasons. One is that this shift has brought the efficacy of the online medium to the forefront, and people are taking it as a necessity rather than a choice.  This medium exists and has its own acceptance. Second, the current operators across the edtech space are focusing heavily on outcomes to give concrete returns on investment, and if those things happen in the right manner, people will have greater trust in the system. Both acceptability and credibility have emerged from this particular ecosystem. The third one is generally short term and will not outlive the pandemic. Here what is happening is that, consumers have become more frugal, so among a person's expenditures such as travel and clothing expenses, education is the most guilt-free expenditure item and so they are indulging it in now.</p><h4>Where do you see the most potential for upGrad outside of India, as you continue your international expansion plans?</h4><p>We are looking actively at Southeast Asia and the Asia Pacific area as well as the Middle East, the UK, and the EU as another area. We have brought in two new CEOs for each region and will take our platform and learning pedagogy to those markets. Currently, 7-9% of our revenue comes from international learners, but these are essentially online programs that originated in India and are marketed abroad. With the two new geographies, we will be catering to the local needs of the given markets. We are currently looking at doing this on our own but are open to inorganic acquisition if there is a good asset that can give us a foot in the door as we expand our presence.</p><h4>Thus far, upGrad has not needed to raise external capital. Will this strategy change with regard to your ambitious international expansion plans? </h4><p>So far, we have been all founder funded. We have a healthy business that we can scale and build with an investment coming from the business itself, though there has been great interest from various groups of investors with whom we are having active conversations. In the next year or so, we will close a round of financing to enable us to expand our presence in India and globally. We have been receiving interest  from both, from within and outside India. There are global funds that are actively interested, so perhaps it is a good time to bring in a partner that will be able to help be part of our journey in the long term.</p><h4>What role do you foresee upGrad, or the edtech sector in general, playing in the implementation of India's ambitious new National Education Policy?</h4><p>The first thing is that the government has pushed for more online degrees, and that push in itself will open a larger market for edtech providers and enabling them online will be crucial. The government is pushing for a stronger adoption of technology within the context of learning on campus, and it is encouraging universities to start using technology, which opens up many opportunities for edtech providers to support offline institutions. Secondly, government announcing the credit increase has also added up to the overall benefits. Now learners can acquire 20%-40% of online credits, thereby doubling up the edtech market. The third critical thing is that the government has also allowed academic credit banks, which enables any learners to do their bachelor's degree for a year, take a break, and then resume after two years to complete the remaining credits or go to a different university and get access to those accumulated credits. That will unlock larger opportunities for edtech like upGrad to reach out to a wider audience with relevant online programs. We have a few online programs that are approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) and a few which are accredited by the National Skill Development Council (NSDC). In India, there are currently 40 million people enrolled in higher education, and we need to add 20 million additional capacity in the next five to six years. Never in the history of human civilisation has a nation been required to train 20 million additional individuals in a short period of time. Therefore, online will need to play a role similar to what mobile phones did at the time when India was growing, and we did not have enough landline penetration. Similarly, online learning sector, with its right university partnerships and technology amalgamation, will play an integral role across geographies, thereby creating a future-ready workforce.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the edtech sector and upGrad for the rest of this year and 2021?</h4><p>From a market perspective, it is a good time for the edtech ecosystem. COVID-19 has been an enabler for edtech and has also given a net positive push to other  sectors. I do not think there will be a post-COVID-19 era, and we are resuming offline classes for about next six months to a year. Given the scale and complexity of this country, it will take even longer, and therefore edtech is here to stay. In the long run, I definitely believe that it will lead to a permanent shift in the minds of consumers, and the penetration of edtech will continue to grow. For upGrad, our tasks are clearly laid out, and we plan to partner with more and more  offline universities to enable them to go online. Moreover, internationalization and taking some of our products to the global markets are an integral part of this year's strategic priorities. This is a good time to look at potential M&amp;As in the education space where we can collaborate and partner with other edtech and education providers to build something larger together than what we could do individually.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently became the first company to float on the Spanish stock exchange in the last two years. This is a great achievement for both the sector and the economy. What does this great milestone mean for Soltec?</h4><p>Yes, it has been a great success for the company, and we are very happy to have reached this milestone. We made this decision because we needed financing to be able to continue growing and to carry out our business plan. We believed that an IPO was the best way to achieve this and we worked hard for it. The pandemic delayed our initial plans but even so, our business model has convinced our investors and we were able to achieve this milestone at a time as difficult as the present. Our business model has convinced our investors and we have been able to achieve this milestone at such a difficult time. The global consensus on the relevance of this sector for the development and growth of economies has also provided a boost to the achievement of this transaction. From now on, we will continue to work with all our efforts to continue positioning ourselves as one of the leading companies in the field of PV solar energy and as a relevant player in the energy transition.</p><h4>Soltec recently launched the SF8 Tracker. An improved version from the previous SF7 in terms of geometry, increased tracker resistance to adverse weather conditions and produces up to 8.6% more power generation than other trackers. What are the key characteristics of the SF8 tracker?</h4><p>Our new product, the SF8 recently launched it is an updated version of SF7, and it is more resistant to difficult weather conditions. The SF8 is the new generation of single-axis trackers, elegantly engineered for robustness and specially designed for larger modules. Its unique 4 to 6 strings 2í—60 configuration with multidrive transmission system within the tracker structure and supersized torque-tube with improved geometry, offers the highest resilience to wind while keeping its elegant design, reducing the number of parts and easing the tracker installation. The revolutionary technology of the SF8 tracker allows up to 8.6% more power generation when bifacial modules are installed. With the TeamTrack system, Soltec can produce a 6% more energy. The improved and adapted algorithm to bifacial modules, achieves an extra yield of up to 0.5%. This extra bifacial gain of SF8 trackers adds to the 2.1% of Bifacial Gain yielded by Soltec's bifacial trackers in comparison to 1P configuration trackers of competitors.</p><h4>Thanks to several initiatives, Soltec has managed to reduce emissions by 39.31% in 2017-2019 compared to the previous three-year period. This has granted Soltec the “sello Reduzco“ from the Ministry of Ecological Transition. What initiatives did you take into action?</h4><p>It is an honor to receive the REDUZCO seal, a recognition of Soltec's commitment in the fight against climate change that inspires us to continue working day by day to raise the company's quality standards and to reach the goal of zero carbon emissions through the use of renewable energies. We have reduced by 39.31% the average emission intensity of the activities carried out at our facilities in Molina de Segura (Murcia, Spain) in the three-year period 2017-2019 with respect to the three-year period 2016-2018.</p><h4>During one of your recent speeches, you suggested there should be two tenders per year, and that the tenders should take into account the carbon footprint. What is your view on this?</h4><p>Yes, recently the Spanish Government approved the renewable energy auctions, a milestone that the whole sector was waiting for and which will be very positive both for our industry and for the society in general. I believe that it is important that renewable energy auctions are technologically neutral and that they have a pay-as-bid design, in which a price is assigned for the energy generated. This is a very powerful tool to give visibility to our sector, and even more at a time like the present, when we need a sustainable way of dealing with the economic crisis more than ever. In the specific case of Soltec, renewable energy auctions help us to have a regular flow of projects, thus creating a more efficient industry in terms of competitiveness. With regard to the carbon footprint, I have always argued that in Spain we have extensive experience in the renewable energy sector and a great deal of local talent, and this is also reflected in all the technologies and materials we use. What I want to say is that we must promote local products, something that would undoubtedly generate further employment. It does not make sense that all the materials were supplied by other countries. To achieve this, it would be important to introduce the carbon footprint requirement. This means that, for example, when I have materials produced in Murcia and installed in Alicante, their carbon footprint would be smaller than if they were brought from China. This would also generate local jobs and increase our competitiveness in the sector. To achieve this, we are part of the Spanish Photovoltaic Union (UNEF), and we are working with them to inform the authorities and the Ministry of Energy about these needs.</p><h4>Soltec is the leader in the Latin American market. In addition, it has supplied projects of more than 4GW on the continent. What are your plans in terms of expansion in Latam?</h4><p>Latin America is extremely important for us. We started in Chile outside of the feeding tariff, and in 2020 we returned to Chile. Brazil is an important market for us, and where we have a very important market share and leadership. The current situation in Mexico has been a little more complex since the decisions taken by its president, López Obrador, regarding renewable energy projects in this region. In any case, our presence in Mexico is also very significant for us and we believe that it is a great country with a lot of potential to develop new projects and great benefits for the renewable energy industry. Indeed, we have presence and offices in practically the whole Latin American territory. It has been an extremely important region for our development in the past and continues to be one of the main focuses of photovoltaic solar energy. In this regard, we will continue to look for opportunities in these countries and will always be willing to study all opportunities available to us in this area which may be positive for the sector, the company and bring added value to our shareholders.</p><h4>What are your priorities for the year ahead and for 2021?</h4><p>Soltec's priority at this time, after the IPO, is to carry out our strategic plan and continue to grow and expand which implies being capable of capturing the growth and demands of today's market. We are living a great moment at a global level for renewable energies and I am convinced that we will be fully able to make the best of it. We are an innovative company in constant evolution, so we will also continue to promote new products and improvements in our services that will help our customers to be more efficient, which will undoubtedly have a clear result for society in general: more and better clean energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has CBRE evolved since 2018, and what have been the main achievements?</h4><p>CBRE in Portugal has grown significantly since 2018, which was our second-best year ever. 2019 was our best year ever, and our business has grown more than 20% from 2018 to 2019. We have grown significantly in different business lines across the whole company, though mainly in our property management services, capital advisory business, and hotels business. This was a market where in those two years, a significant number of investors and developers were active, and that feeds all our business lines from valuations and project management to property management and so on.</p><h4>Are there any specific areas that experienced the biggest growth?</h4><p>Putting 2020 aside, we have growth across all the business lines. Capital markets had a special year in 2019, as did office leasing, valuations, consultancy, property management, industrial and logistics leasing, and retail. The only area where we would still like to grow geographically is in Porto. Our business in Porto is one of our main areas of focus.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 affected CBRE, and what has been your strategy to balance the fall in real estate investments?</h4><p>If not for COVID-19, I am 100% sure 2020 would have been another record year for investment purposes in Portugal. The market was put on hold for five months, and most investors put their projects on standby. However, we started bringing new deals to the market from early June, and the reaction was fairly positive and better than I expected. As of mid-October, looking at the market environment and what is happening around us, it is clear there is still a significant amount of investor appetite. Those investors go from domestic to international and from core investors to opportunistic investors. There is the general feeling that there will be more opportunities, either now or in the near future, namely in the most affected sectors. There is still a great deal of liquidity in the world to invest, and Portugal remains on the map of these investors. This is a consequence of an achievement that Portugal made prior to COVID-19. From 2014 until early 2020, Portugal grew as an economy. In terms of the real estate market, it has become extremely attractive for companies that wish to have their offices in Portugal or grow new businesses in Portugal, and that attracts investors. If your fundamentals are solid and there is potential to grow and increase in value, then investors will come naturally.</p><h4>What is your vision for certain segments to grow in the medium term?</h4><p>In terms of sectors, the office sector is still fairly attractive despite all the noise around remote working, which no one can predict 100%. We will all have to wait and see what will happen in the future, though we can agree that after all these months, many say they would perhaps like to spend a day or two at home but still prefer to work in an office environment. Office is a sector that is still dynamic. The beds sector, which includes residential, is a sector that investors perceive as a low-risk, low-return sector. In Portugal, there is no PRS or multi-family market, though we will have it in the near future. We now see developers and investors starting to enter this space. There are also opportunities in hotels, and there are investors that want to take advantage of those opportunities. Logistics is always on the top of the list for investors. Shopping centers are likely a no-go area right now at this specific moment in time, though I would not rule out possible opportunities that some investors might see in the shopping center area.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your recent logistics project?</h4><p>We will commercialize the first 45,000sqm of this development, which will be developed by Merlin, the Spanish SOCIMI. For a long time, there was no new logistics product in Portugal, so it is extremely important that we now see this new supply coming to the market with more modern specifications that will suit modern occupiers as well. I expect this product to have a great impact in the market. Finally, some of the logistics operators or companies that need logistics operations will now have the opportunity to lease up-to-date and modern facilities with all the modern specifications found in other markets. It is great news for the market, and our expectations are high.</p><h4>What additional services does CBRE plan to offer in the medium term to further diversify the company?</h4><p>It has been three years, and time passes extremely quickly. We now have a strong hotels division dealing with transactions, operator selections, and doing some consultancy work that we started in September 2017, so it is fairly consolidated. We also have a capital advisors business line, which is where we have our corporate finance department and where we do equity raising and debt advisory. We also work with banks on the buy and sell side of the acquisitions of NPL portfolios or REO, so the real estate owned assets of the banks. We do a bit of M&amp;A as well within the real estate sector, and it has been a fairly interesting journey since we opened this business line, which has been successful and well received by our clients. More recently, we opened an agribusiness department. We have a team of two in Portugal—one valuer and one person dedicated to transactions within the capital markets team. This team is led by Jack Svoronos, an Australian colleague based in Italy, and he covers Portugal, Spain, and Italy. The purpose of this business line is to deal with agricultural lands namely doing valuations and transactions as well. The agribusiness world is a fairly sophisticated one, and we realized many of our clients that we dealt with are also involved in agribusiness, namely institutional investors.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the rest of the year and 2021?</h4><p>My key priority for 2021 is certainly the technology issue, because we realized we sometimes still work with old tools. We also work close with Spain in some of our areas; for example, we have an Iberian property management platform that started with shopping centers, and it then expanded to the other sectors. Bringing together some of our teams in an Iberian approach brings us synergies and more business. Those synergies are not only in terms of our business lines but also in the technology issue. Clearly, Spain being a bigger market and CBRE in Spain being a bigger business, they are more advanced than we are in technology terms, and we can benefit significantly from being closer to Spain and creating an offering to our clients that is seamless in the two countries, because most of our clients see Iberia as one market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has COVID-19 impacted your business model?</h4><p>The mining industry in Mexico was not declared essential at the beginning of lockdown, so that had an impact on our mining solution business. At the same time, we were able to prepare, as we have other operations that are focused on the chemical industry. We continue to operate in other sites, and we used this crisis as an opportunity to prepare ourselves for future developments. There were some changes in some procedures, especially in the material delivery and how we take care of our personnel. We are working on that hand-in-hand with our customers. We want to help them succeed—that is our reality. There are positive prospects for the mining industry in the future. Companies need to be able to operate—that is the most important thing. We expect some recovery and hope to maximize operations based on the capabilities of each of our customers.</p><h4>How have your priorities and goals changed when it comes to sales?</h4><p>Our main priorities are our employees and the needs of our customers. We are making sure that our employees stay healthy and follow all the correct protocols. We are also supporting our customers in this new normal. Our customers face many challenges, and we need to come up with processes and protocols to not only support them but also make sure they are also being taken care of. We are taking the current crisis month by month, but the center of everything remains making sure we are doing our best for our employees and customers.</p><h4>What are the latest developments regarding your plant in Laguna?</h4><p>According to the latest ruling from the Supreme Court, the situation was in our favor, but we are still waiting. COVID-19 has slowed things down, and not all the different tribunals are open. We still have to go through some legal cases. It is important for us to work with our communities and socialize this project with them. We have two fronts: the legal front, which will be resolved in our favor; and having the right to operate through community approval. This is a really important period for these projects. They make great sense as we will bring a great deal of employment and investment to the region at a time when Mexico needs it—the economic impact will be huge after COVID-19.</p><h4>What are your main plans when it comes to increasing your presence in Latin America?</h4><p>It is really important to be close to our customers and serve them correctly. We continuously work on this aspect, and this has been our philosophy over time. We have been mostly focusing on markets in the Americas. We are also having interactions with our global markets as well. That will continue to be our focus.</p><h4>What are the advantages of investing in the mining industry in comparison to other sectors?</h4><p>The safe haven for everybody when there is a great deal of uncertainty is precious metals.<br>Investors will need to look for sectors that are more efficient. In the next few years, the mining industry will have a really positive outlook in terms of growth, and more projects will come.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the actions being taken by the public sector for the mining industry?</h4><p>The approach has been excellent. The Undersecretary of Mining has formed a taskforce for many mining companies to work together and develop protocols. Having the undersecretary personally go to each one of the sites to review the protocols set a positive example. Companies are also committed to the business and their employees, and although there are different protocols, the objective is to keep their employees safe and continue their operations. This is an industry that is committed to safety due to the nature of the industry, and the current pandemic has pushed us to continue in the same way. Mining companies are a great asset to invest in. At Chemours, we are focused on our clients' needs and we will make sure every client is able to optimize its production.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your perspective on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mining sector?</h4><p>The last few years were dry for exploration companies. The problem is that while major companies continue to produce, there are not many new projects in the pipeline. As a result, some large companies have been investing in junior exploration companies. This has happened not only in Mexico but all over the world. For example, companies such as Newmont or Barrick have invested in junior companies and their decision to do so has produced good results. One of the reasons is that it is cheaper to partner with a junior exploration company as compared to setting up a whole exploration team. In recent years, people have invested heavily in large or mid-sized companies. The mining sector has caught the attention of many investors, especially those who had invested in the cannabis industry. For example, after Canada legalized cannabis in 2018, investors from around the world flocked there to cash on new opportunities, but that rush was followed by a correction. Those who were able to hold on to their capital started looking for opportunities in other sectors. Several investors parked their capital in the mining sector because it offers great opportunities as compared to other sectors such as energy and IT. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a great deal of fear in the market. Mining will be one of the industries that will recover the fastest. For example, investors are buying precious metals as a hedge against all the uncertainty in the market. Moreover, governments will invest in infrastructure projects in an attempt to reactivate the economy. This will also be a big positive for mining companies. There has been a great deal of success when it comes to improving access to financing for junior mining companies with interesting portfolios. At present, large producers in Mexico are eying smaller players. 2020 is turning out to be a difficult year, but we are optimistic for 2021.</p><h4>Do you think this optimistic view is shared by other mining operators in Mexico?</h4><p>I believe so. I can say this because I have participated in several online events. In my case, I specialize in Latin America, and from what I have seen, there is a great deal of optimism from investors and mining operators. An increasing number of Mexican investors will invest in mining companies in Canada.</p><h4>What can be done to motivate more Mexican investors to invest in the mining industry?</h4><p>It is a challenging task, but the key is to collaborate with other stakeholders to promote the sector. At present, the Mexican stock exchange as well as the new stock exchange are not heavily involved in the mining sector, and that represents a good opportunity. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce could help us to motivate and educate more people. People in Mexico think investing in stocks is exclusively for the wealthy, but that's the wrong view. In Canada, for example, it is common for people to invest in stocks. We need to take several steps to get Mexico to that level. One of the obstacles is that the brokers or the financial advisors are not mining-savvy and do not recommend the mining industry. They have a clear lack of appetite. I hope Mexican companies and people involved in the mining sector will continue to do well in these difficult times.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the efforts being undertaken by the Mexican government to reactivate the mining industry? </h4><p>Francisco Quiroga, the Vice Minister of Mines, has done a wonderful job so far. What is unique about him is that he has a solution-oriented approach. He is a very professional person, and I am happy to see he is leading the sector. The mining industry can bring a lot of investment to Mexico, which in turn will help develop remote areas of the country.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has GDI diversified its portfolio? </h4><p>2019 was the year we decided to diversify both in terms of our typical business lines and countries. Before, we were known for pipeline construction and mining work, but now we have decided to diversify into the complete midstream segment, especially in storage terminal construction as EPC contractors. Now we design, procure, and construct projects for storage terminals. We finished the Veracruz hydrocarbons terminal, and we have decided to enter additional international markets. One market was Europe, and the other was Nicaragua in the mining division for a small quarry private client. In Europe, we looked at 15 river crossings for a gas pipeline in Serbia, which required a lot more collaboration.</p><h4>What are your next steps when it comes to international expansion?</h4><p>We are evaluating Canada and Texas for oil and gas. As for mining, 2020 will be a year of execution. Now that we are in Europe, we have to see if it is worth staying. We believe Saudi Aramco, thanks to its IPO, will require a great deal of infrastructure, and Saudi Arabia will be the next place to look at for mid-stream projects. The world has become a globalized economy, even though people are closing doors.</p><h4>Is expansion one of your main goals for 2020?</h4><p>For the moment, yes. We are building a storage terminal in Manzanillo for the private sector. The challenge is that it requires a lot of offshore work and a landfill connection between land and sea. The installation of the terminal, both connecting it and installing it, has become a huge challenge and it will make 2020 busy.</p><h4>What are the most important characteristics you are looking for when it comes to international partnerships?</h4><p>We are looking for a local partner who can help us grow fast and with whom we can complement the construction of pipelines or storage terminals. We have identified certain companies in Texas and Calgary. With that in mind, we are trying to see if there is a cultural match. When you arrive in another country, it is about matching the culture and wanting to get things done. As long as we find the right partner, we will be happy to continue working.</p><h4>How do you ensure success in GDI's international ventures?</h4><p>The mentality of staying in one's own country, seeing what happens, and growing with the country is not enough. If you want to grow and if you want to go far, the world is your oyster. The project in Europe is a small project worth around USD15 million. The one in Nicaragua is around USD28 million. These types of projects give us a chance to understand the country and how things work. Once we visualize the project, we can start thinking about how to mobilize resources. The first step is knowing how to collaborate far from home. For me, mobilization simply involves technical practices that need to be performed. We do not know yet if there is a market in Europe. The economy there is kind of stagnated like Mexico. Other countries like Saudi Arabia and Canada are growing especially in gas, and we are interested in these markets.</p><h4>What opportunities have you identified within the global energy transition?</h4><p>The world is going through an energy transition, and the growth of gas is just a tiny variable. We are going through a generational change. MIT produced an interesting tool that allows you to understand that this energy transition is an 80-year process. Even with taxes on coal and oil and subsidized renewables, we cannot achieve the requirements of the Paris Agreement. As GDI, we want to follow the transition accordingly by focusing first on oil and gas and then transitioning to other sources. Diversifying is about planting seed by seed and watching how they grow. <br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led you to take preventative actions at Cyanco before COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic?</h4><p>As a global business, Cyanco saw signs early on that the COVID-19 breakout in Asia would turn into a pandemic. Once we received news that it was arriving in western markets, we quickly began efforts to protect our employees, customers, and partners. Cyanco proactively increased its protective safety measures at all plants and terminals across the globe. We closed our offices early on and strengthened our remote work capabilities. For essential workers, we made PPE mandatory, introduced social distancing measures, monitored temperatures, and required pre-entry questionnaires at all sites. We also changed operating procedures at our plants. For example, truck drivers are now required to stay in their vehicles to minimize their interaction with people. All of this began in late January/early February. Our containment efforts didn't stop at our own facilities. Customer collaboration is important at Cyanco and we have worked closely with our suppliers and customers to share best practices and increase safety protocols across our networks. In a world where collaboration is paramount, Cyanco is using its strong customer and vendor relationships to get ahead of the COVID-19 virus. Fortunately, to date, Cyanco has not had a single incident of COVID-19 across the entire organization, at any site.</p><h4>What strategies are you using to ensure there is enough inventory during times of social distancing?</h4><p>Sodium cyanide is the one chemical that gold and silver mines must have to function. Without it, mines cannot extract the metal efficiently. When we first became aware of COVID-19, we focused on building our inventory levels and stabilizing our supply chains by expanding our network of delivery and raw material partners. We also worked with customers to help them increase their on-site inventories, increased our raw material supplies, and made contingency plans to cover workforce outages. Our diversified supply chain approach, including contingency plans and developing a back-up option for every part of our operations, will continue to be our model until the world becomes much safer. I'm proud to say that we have not missed a single delivery throughout the pandemic. We have also stepped up our efforts to support mines throughout the world. Cyanco primarily serves North and South America, with limited volumes going to customers in Africa and the Middle East. However, throughout the pandemic, Cyanco has become a reliable source for the global mining industry, even in Asia, where mines have approached us for cyanide and PPE. After ensuring that our existing customer base was fully supplied, we have done our best to meet the industry's needs. We believe the trust and relationships we've built this year will help us broadly expand in the future.</p><h4>What actions are you taking to increase the sustainability of mining operations?</h4><p>Technology is the key to any successful company, not just in the chemical or mining industry, but across all industries. Since I joined Cyanco as CEO, which will be two years ago this September, the company has significantly expanded its data analytics and R&amp;D functions. This supports our goals for organic growth and diversification. We are also increasing our ability to produce products in a safer, cleaner, and more sustainable way with a higher yield and high purity.</p><h4>How has Cyanco positioned itself as one of the leading global suppliers of sodium cyanide?</h4><p>What really differentiates us from other suppliers is the end-to-end product lifecycle approach we take with our customers. Our applied technology team works with mines to enhance safety and performance related to dissolving, detox, and optimizing the cyanide circuit. We work with mines to help them recover more gold from cyanide in both mills and heap leaches. We truly partner with our customers for their success—that is the key to our longevity and growth in the industry.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the company's diversification plans?</h4><p>Riverside Resources has a long history of working in Mexico. The company has been doing exploration work in Mexico for more than 13 years. At the same time, other countries hold interesting opportunities. This has been the case with Canada, where we also have a strong database and good technical knowledge, which we can leverage to capture opportunities early on. Riverside Resources uses the prospect generator model. Under this model, we acquire projects at an early stage and then find partners to work with. At present, Canada looks promising in terms of expansion and good geological potential.</p><h4>What is the main added value that you strive to offer with this new spin off of Capitan?</h4><p>As a prospect generator, Riverside Resources works on numerous projects with different partners, but with the Peñoles project being more advanced, we felt there was greater value to shareholders by spinning out into Capitan Mining. In addition, given the recent rise in prices of gold and silver, this decision was well timed. Capitan Mining will have a strong start with a great asset with initial resources, an experienced Mexico-based team, and a favorable time in the markets.</p><h4>What is your outlook for exploration activity in Mexico and Canada for the rest of the year?</h4><p>Exploration will continue to pick up. Explorers have adapted quickly to COVID-19. I have been following a number of companies and most of them are back to work. Fortunately, drill projects have several stages of advancements, including small drill projects and big drill programs. Since they tend to be in remote regions, it is easier to maintain personnel in camps and follow all the protocols to make sure everybody is safe and healthy. Therefore, I do not see COVID-19 as a big risk for exploration activities. All the explorers and operators in Mexico have been responsible and quick to adapt. Before we stopped operations, the sector had already taken big steps toward making sure everybody was safe. We are not seeing any outbreaks, and we hope it will stay that way. We have been saying all along that we want to be part of the solution, and we are doing a good job at it.</p><h4>Would you say the industry has been able to adapt quickly because it is used to working with strict safety protocols?</h4><p>Absolutely. Safety is the top priority in the mining industry. It is not just about putting on protective equipment; the culture around mine sites is strong. If you visit any modern mine, you will see that safety is the first priority. Introducing new measures is easier in the mining industry because all companies have a strong safety culture.</p><h4>What challenges have you faced due to the pandemic? </h4><p>Two of the main challenges are security and access. We have been able to deal with them because we are strict with our processes. We have a good network in Mexico, which allows us to stay informed of the areas that might not be advisable to go to at a given time. We also have a pretty good network of contacts for access. Simply put, we have been able to overcome these challenges because we have an advantage over other companies.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mexican mining industry and how well has the Mexican government developed the sector?</h4><p>Although we would have liked it if mining had been declared essential from the beginning, we are pleased it is one of the industries eventually declared essential by the government. We have to recognize all the hard work done by Francisco Quiroga, the Undersecretary of Mining. He has been touring all mines and making sure that everybody is following the protocols.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has COVID-19 impacted your business model in Mexico, and what strategies have you used to adapt to the new reality?</h4><p>We were operating our mine in Guerrero, which had gotten back into production after being placed into care and maintenance throughout last half of 2019. We re-started production in January 2020 operating through February and March. Unfortunately, as a result of COVID-19, we suspended operations for two months under the government-mandated health precautions. We are a small company, and this situation has affected us dramatically because when cash is not flowing, it is difficult to meet one's obligations. Additional difficulties arose as a result of restricted travel to and from our mining projects, which has hampered our funding efforts by restricting site visits. A number of different groups that wanted to visit our sites, especially the Tahuehueto project, had to wait because of the pandemic.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the objectives of the recent funding alliance with Accendo Bank?</h4><p>It is important to note that the deal has not been finalized yet. There is a period of due diligence that we will go through in order to close it. This alliance will provide the bulk of the funding we need to finish the construction on our Tahuehueto goldmine. In that regard, this alliance is extremely important for our company. We initially received funding in shape of a loan—an off-take facility with Trafigura. Other than that, we were funding the project with cash flows out of Campo Morado; however, in mid-2019 we had to place the Campo Morado Mine into care and maintenance for six months. As a result, we had insufficient capital to actually complete the construction. The alliance with Accendo has come at the right time. We may still require a small amount of capital but we are confident we can raise that publicly or through a streaming deal.</p><h4>A number of mining companies in Mexico are facing cash flow problems. What is your main strategy to regain financial stability?</h4><p>We have resumed operations since the government of Mexico declared mining an essential activity. We were actually one of the first companies to qualify under the new rules to restart. We submitted our report of how we are taking care of COVID-19 onsite, protecting the community and our workers. We are back in production, and that is helping our cash flow. The agreement with Accendo Bank will provide us with the necessary funding to move forward with the construction of Tahuehueto. It is our flagship project and a company-building asset that will produce cash flows once to is in production.</p><h4>What are your main priorities when it comes to Campo Morado?</h4><p>Campo Morado is a really interesting project. It is also challenging because it is in the state of Guerrero, which is widely known as a tough state to operate in. Campo Morado is located in a well mineralized volcanogenic sulfide district. When we purchased it, it had seven or eight known ore bodies, and that currently makes up the bulk of our resources. The site has over 17 million ton of resources, and according to our calculations, mining 2,000 tons a day would give it a 17-year life. It is challenging metallurgically, and we are recovering about 15% of the gold and 30-40% of the silver. There is a possibility that if we can take this through the second phase testing, we will have a solution to increase precious metal recoveries. If we are successful in that, we May turn Campo Morado from a zinc mine into a silver mine. Another way to increase revenues is by increasing the production and mill throughput. If we are able to find additional capital to complete this expansion will should be able to reach a production rate of 3,000 tons per day where economics of scale should increase profits. This is one of our top priorities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Santa Cruz Silver Mining been impacted by the pandemic?</h4><p>So far, none of our workers have been infected. New regulations are coming in, and we have to comply with them. The mining sector in Mexico is extremely well regulated and organized, so it was easy for us to implement new health measures to halt the spread of COVID-19. Notably, we had to halt our operations in Hidalgo because we are not generating enough revenue. Labor costs represent 45% of our total costs. Although we are not generating revenue, we had to pay our workers, which impacted our cash flow. Our plan is to reactivate mining operations in July. Mining is recognized as an essential activity by the government, but restarting mining operations takes time. We have some suppliers who are demanding late payments, and it will take us up to three months to catch up. Moreover, CFE, the state-owned electric utility, wants us to continue paying our electricity bills. We are not receiving any government support to cope with this situation. We were awarded a 60-day moratorium on electricity payments, but it will expire in June. We did not generate revenue in May, so we are still in the same situation. I am thankful to CFE for providing us with some time, but it is not enough. As for our workers, we have signed agreements to delay part of the payments, which has helped us. Overall, the biggest impact of the pandemic has been on our cash flow. On the positive side, the price of silver has increased from USD12 per oz to USD17 in 2020.</p><h4>How close is the company to achieving its IRMA certification?</h4><p>The Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) stands out from other certifications such as the ESR, a certificate for socially responsible companies in Mexico, by being much more comprehensive and focused on best practices. It helps increase trust among investors and employees. We are the only company on the continent working toward this certification.</p><h4>What was your main objective behind acquiring the Zimapan Mining assets from Grupo Peñoles in July? </h4><p>It is a transformational transaction for Santa Cruz to add the Zimapan mine to its portfolio. We have already had the privilege of working in this mine under a lease agreement with Minera Cedros. This acquisition will help us towards our goal of becoming a mid-tier silver producer, and we thank Peñoles for their support in this process.</p><h4>One of the few sectors that have experienced growth in Mexico is mining, according to the Mexican Institute of Statistics. What is your view on that?</h4><p>We do not compete with other companies for our product. When a price of a metal drops, the only way to grow is by increasing production. The price of Zinc has started to increase, but it has not been enough. Gold prices have increased because it is seen as a safe haven in times of turmoil. As for silver, we need prices to increase more in the short run. We have reduced zinc production at the Francisco Madero mine because we do not know exactly how the market will change in the future. I assume some foreign companies will not restart their operations. Some will choose to downsize operations, and some might decide to wrap up their operations in Mexico.</p><h4>Is Santa Cruz Silver Mining planning to increase production in order to recover some of its losses from after the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p>We will increase production if we can get more investment. For now, I just want to generate cash flow to survive through 2021. As for 2020, we are already halfway through, and it has had a big impact on us. Currently, the chances of securing new funds are low. People who manage funds are not investing because they do not know what will happen. With this in mind, our strategy is to survive. <br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you consider your biggest achievement as President of AIMMGM?</h4><p>One of my greatest achievements as President of AIMMGM was the recent update we implemented to the philosophy of the association with the collaboration of our board members and district presidents. We collaborated to define a new mission, vision, and values for AIMMGM based on our new philosophy. We additionally collaborated to update the bylaws that mandate our association. The mission we established is based on the essence of the association: to integrate and develop professionals in the mining sector to the benefit of mining in Mexico and the country overall.</p><h4>What has been the main impact of the pandemic on the Mexican mining industry?</h4><p>The biggest impact was the two-month period in which we had to suspend all mining activities. We also had to quickly adapt to the new ways of working to control infections of COVID-19. Both situations have resulted in a major cost of operations for operators and players along the supply chain.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the actions that the government and private sector has taken so far to reactivate the mining industry as of June 1?</h4><p>I am extremely positive about the new actions that the government has implemented to reactivate the mining industry. The public sector has worked well with the private sector to establish new protocols for the context. Mining is one of the sectors that has best adapted to the pandemic. One important thing that we managed to achieve during this pandemic is for the federal government to consider mining as an essential activity. This is huge news for the industry, as it is the first time that the government has recognized the importance of the mining industry and the role it plays in the social and economic development of Mexico.</p><h4>What would be your main advice to investors when it comes to how to proceed in the Mexican mining industry?</h4><p>My main advice would be to stay informed and receive advice from experts in all aspects of the industry. I am referring to the legal and governmental issues on all three levels of the government, community relationships, and fiscal and labor issues. These are all aspects that need to be consulted before an investor makes the decision to enter the Mexican mining industry especially in such times of uncertainty.</p><h4>What metals do you foresee will perform the best in this pandemic and why?</h4><p>I predict that silver and gold will be the best-performing metals during the pandemic because during periods of uncertainty, investors typically view these two metals as a safe havens for investment. The impact and consequences of the pandemic are also factors that are helping increase prices.</p><h4>In what ways is AIMMGM supporting mining companies during such uncertain times?</h4><p>We are continuing to offer support to mining companies and members of the association by offering training. We are now offering online courses as well. The analysis and reformulation of the industry we implemented in the association has allowed to find better ways to offer solutions and support the members of AIMMGM. One of the best ways to achieve this is through training. We are currently launching the main project of my term as president: CAP. This training will on at a national level and will be offered online for all professionals in the mining industry. It starts in mid-August 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has COVID-19 impacted the mining union, and how have you adapted to this new reality in Mexico?</h4><p>I do believe “impact" is the right word, because it has impacted us greatly. We are evaluating new possibilities. Everyone is being impacted by this dire situation. The numbers are telling; 800,000 jobs—across all industries—will disappear due to the crisis. Mining is essential to the development of a country and the world, so the fact that we were not considered an essential activity from the beginning affected us. According to the government and Ministry of Health, only 30% of our miners will go back to work. We plan to follow the rules, as we are invested in safekeeping our workers' health. However, this course of action should have been announced a long time ago. We hope the measures to boost the economy help with the recovery of the mining sector. Mexico's economy is not doing well at this moment. We make up 8% of GDP. We only want economic stability for our workers; they need their jobs.</p><h4>What are your suggestions for businesses and the management of this contingency?</h4><p>Fortunately, we have great relations with companies. The mining sector was not completely shut down, because it was still necessary to have well-built walls, pumping, and so on. It is all a process that cannot just be shut down. It is great that companies will apply the measures, though most companies were already doing so. It will not be difficult for most companies as they were already implementing safety measures, isolating cases, and more. I will share a fact that astounds everyone: those mines that were not shut down do not have any cases. That is what people are unable to see. With all due respect, our workers are safer with us than at home; they are being tested and attended to by the company's own doctors when necessary. If a company has even the slightest doubt, the possibly infected worker will be isolated, and every employee gets tested. Families should stay at home, and miners should be able to work in a safe environment. We are following all the health measures. It is all a collective effort. Health inspections are essential, as health is our priority; our job as the union is to make sure every company follows the rules to protect workers.</p><h4>How are you helping miners accept that this situation might last for a year or two?</h4><p>The workers are aware; they are not oblivious to global developments. We have solid communication with our workers, indicating safety protocols, how to take care of our children, elderly, pregnant and nursing women, those with preexisting conditions, and so on. We mandated that vulnerable workers stay at home. In the mining industry, we have a base salary and a productivity salary, and the latter is being affected by this situation. Companies are helping with this. We know this is a temporary situation, and we are learning every day how to manage it in the best possible way for workers.</p><h4>How have your vision and priorities changed, at least for now?</h4><p>Both have changed a fair bit. This is a learning experience we never expected. Personally, as a federal representative, I heard about the preventive measures in December 2019 from another federal representative who is a doctor. She was worried about it back then, and it allowed some of us to prepare. However, Mexico was not prepared for this. Safety measures should have been initiated earlier; the health sector knew this was coming. Sadly, many did not pay attention, and now we have many confirmed cases and a painful number of deaths. We are all adapting to the situation. Social distancing, masks—we have to do whatever it takes, not only miners but all Mexicans. This has shown us how important it is to take care of one another.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your general vision as undersecretary of mining?</h4><p>The current administration looks at mining not only as a sector that can generate jobs and economic activity in remote regions but also as a competitive lever for manufacturing in the country. Mexico is a manufacturing power. The industrial sector in Mexico can benefit from locally extracted mining inputs such as copper, silver, or iron. We want the sector to generate foreign exchange through exports and become a source of competitiveness when integrated into other manufacturing chains across the country. We believe in a future dominated by electro mobility and other similar technologies. All of this will require certain metals and minerals, which is why it is crucial to develop a strong mining industry. Mexico is a large producer of metals and minerals and has important metal deposits with great potential such as lithium, gold, silver, copper, zinc, and nickel. We want the mining sector to be a lever of competitiveness for productive chains rather than just being an export sector. We do not want a forced integration to maximize national content, but an integration that generates value and competitiveness. As a result of this, industrial activities will flourish in certain areas.</p><h4>What can Mexico do to become more competitive over other mining markets in the region?</h4><p>In cooperation with the industry, we have identified the most relevant cost and risk elements, such as paperwork, security, and road infrastructure, for example. Each of these elements define the competitiveness of a sector. Insecurity is another issue that greatly impacts companies; it is a multidimensional issue that involves unions, local authorities, and communities. We are working on a coordinated effort to improve the security situation. The process becomes easier if the companies have a security specialist with sufficient decision-making power to carry out initiatives jointly with us. If there is no security specialist on the other side or simply a security consultant who reports to the parent company in another country and cannot distinguish a real threat from a fabricated threat, the situation becomes more difficult. We have made important advances by connecting with certain counterparts that are informed and have the decision-making power to operate together.</p><h4>Another challenge facing Mexico is that there are not enough large mines being developed to replace depleting projects. What does Mexico need to further promote investment in exploration?</h4><p>This is a global trend and phenomenon. In Mexico, it is already several years old. We will address this problem in two parts. First, the Mexican Ecological Service has redefined its strategy; it not only acts as a deposit of technical, scientific, or geological information but is also a lever of competitiveness for the mining sector, generating information in a useful way. We are also aware that exploration activities in Mexico are not immediately deductible as a tax expense, and investors lack confidence in the certainty of rules. This distrust is justified to some extent because in the recent past, there has been an empowerment of some actors that were marginalized in the past. We must reach agreements with these newly empowered players to build an environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive mining sector.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We will continue working on improving the permitting process. We want a simple procedure where there is minimal intervention of human discretion to avoid possibilities of corruption. To that end, we are working on a digital system. We want the same to happen with the regulations that exist outside our direct field of action because they also affect mining. We are working with other government authorities to do so. We are evaluating mechanisms for the solution of bottlenecks so that a project that is stuck is treated in the most practical way possible. In 2020, we will continue consolidating a system of coordination between dependencies and the government.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of Access Bank and its establishment in Mozambique?</h4><p>Access Bank is a 32-year-old bank. We started modestly in Nigeria, being mainly a corporate bank. In 2002, the bank's management decided to do a management buyout of Access Bank and transform it onto the path it is on today. First, the bank decided to fund itself and acquired Intercontinental Bank, the eighth-largest bank in the country at the time. Our story is mainly about organic growth plus mergers and acquisitions over the years. The latest one in January 2019 was with Diamond Bank, the biggest retail bank in the country at the time. That merger made Access Bank the biggest retail bank in terms of client numbers. We have around 36 million clients overall and 46 million accounts, mostly in Nigeria but also all across the other countries where we are present, namely Ghana, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Congo, Zambia, and The Gambia. Two years ago, the bank decided to start on an expansion plan for two reasons. The first was to make us a more relevant bank in the countries where we were already present. The goal was to be in the top five biggest banks in those countries. The other aim was to enter new markets and expand our footprint in Africa, and the first new market we selected was Mozambique for two main reasons. One was to reinforce our presence in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). Second, our decision was because of Mozambique's growth potential due to its oil and gas projects. We applied for our license in Mozambique in 2018, and it was approved in October 2019. 2020 has been slightly difficult due to COVID-19, but we managed to open Access Bank in Mozambique in October 2020. At around the same time, Access Bank announced a potential merger with BancABC, and we are awaiting the Central Bank of Mozambique's approval for that. We saw this acquisition as a way to grow quickly and leverage on BancABC's existing clients. We have also opened in Kenya, we are opening in Cameroon and Ghana, and in October 2020 we acquired a bank in South Africa. We will open in Tanzania, Botswana, and Angola by YE2020-beginning of 2021. There are a few other countries being discussed, but we have a large expansion plan. The group saw an opportunity because the mature American and European banks are basically exiting the continent due to the crises in recent years, except for supporting some large operations here and there. Access Bank aims to be Africa's gateway to the world. With the reputation we have been building across Africa, our vision is to be the world's most respected African bank. We want to create a truly global African bank that can trade in all markets. This also means we must be present in the majority of countries in our market.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 affected Access Bank opening its new operations in Mozambique, and how are you responding to this situation?</h4><p>It changed our way of doing banking; in fact, it had the extremely positive impact of driving the maturity of our business in terms of digital advancement and innovation. Some companies that were forced to go digital now realize it can save them money while making them as effective—if not more—as before. The way we used to run our business—visiting clients, meeting for lunches, delivering cards by hand, and going to people's businesses to open accounts—have all changed. We experienced roughly six months of adapting, and both us and our clients understand the way we should work from now on to mitigate all our initial issues in terms of client service. This is a new way for businesses to realize their operations. We now know that we can operate with many of our staff at home, and we understand the value of the disaster recovery plans we drew up in the past but had never used. We have implemented all the necessary measures to work within the pandemic situation for as long as it lasts. Only around 30% of our staff are working in the office; the majority are working from home. They are rotating on a 15-day basis. The greatest challenge was interacting with clients within the limits of COVID-19. People are good at adapting, and within a short time frame we managed to adapt our business to do the same things as before, but in a different way.</p><h4>What are your main goals for the year ahead and for 2021?</h4><p>We are still running our soft launch phase in Mozambique. We have a few objectives for the last few months of 2020. One is to start Access Bank's expansion plan and build or refit six branches by YE2020. That will give us extra coverage in terms of our network, access to clients, and entry into other provinces. The second aim is our acquisition and further merger with BancABC, which we hope to have approved by YE2020. The third and perhaps most important aim is to start showing our clients what Access Bank can do. Banking relationships are like personal relationships; it is difficult to replace an existing relationship. To encourage clients to switch to us, they need to feel comfortable and understand what is there to gain by banking with Access Bank. We are discussing this with clients and explaining how we can make a difference to their businesses. Fortunately, we have a high level of acceptance in Mozambique in all segments. We are having positive discussions with clients, from corporates through to small companies. Our objective is to reach the end of 2020 with a relevant balance and a small net profit. We are not far away from achieving that target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given your great experience in the public relations sector at a corporate level, what are some of the best practices learned and applicable to an environment like Peru?</h4><p>In the current context, within a globalized world, public relations play an important role, as it builds identity and reinforces the reputation of a company or person. This activity facilitates the process of building trust, generating links between parties, shortening distances, and having permanent visibility in the corporate world. Although time is an executive's most valuable resource, it is fundamental to program an annual agenda of events identifying those that are closest to the professional objectives and prioritizing spaces in the agenda for meetings and lunches. Relating to key people is important for business and essential for the strategic planning of the company. We must also make the most of our network of contacts. Networking is one of the most relevant practices in the business world; possibly the most important challenge to benefit from public relations is developing a strategic network of contacts, the same that must be kept alive to build long-term relationships. Finally, nothing is out of reach. The leading entrepreneurs of relevant institutions or power authorities are accessible; it all depends on the attitude we have to make the approach and how we use our network of contacts to achieve the goal.</p><h4>With the launch of your new book on this subject, what would be your advice to senior executives on how good management of the public image of both a company and a particular executive translates into good performance for the company?</h4><p>To achieve our professional goals, we must know that a successful executive is an executive who relates. Public relations opens doors not only to negotiate but also to facilitate the exchange between companies. It brings us closer to the circles where one wants to be and generates links. Having spaces for interaction and dialogue allows us to make ourselves known, exchange experiences, discover possible partners for a business, establish genuine relationships, and/or build up the loyalty of those we already have. Beyond making short-term transactions, first one has to create effective connections and empathy with the interest groups. When they achieve this and maintain a two-way communication, we can build long-term relationships.</p><h4>What are your recommendations for successful networking and an effective relationship in the current context marked by social isolation?</h4><p>In the current context, where we cannot meet face to face, we must continue to maintain links with our stakeholders and not lose what we have built so far. The economically complicated period is the time to stay on our clients' radar; the pandemic has created a tremendous challenge, but there are opportunities. When being permanently connected on social networks, we should take advantage of the space to share valuable information and have greater visibility. Doing business networking on digital platforms can also help significantly. Those webinars being held help us stay interconnected, and if we organize them ourselves, we add value to our stakeholders and strengthen existing relationships. In these times, empathy and solidarity also play an important role. We can offer our assistance, share our skills, or contribute ideas for projects. The circumstances imposed by social isolation can also be useful for executives without a physical presence in Peru but still have business interests in the country. The pandemic has exponentially accelerated the relationship through digital platforms, which allows us to expand markets and approach colleagues abroad with great ease for meetings that previously required physical presence. We are just a click away and borders no longer exist. This situation has given us the opportunity to discover that video conferences are a powerful tool, because they allow us to be more efficient at work and, above all, be in permanent contact with our stakeholders. We can meet with many people in a single day, and the frequency of these meetings is greater than before. We are saving time on travel and accommodation; in fact, I would even say we are being more productive.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PROMPERíš has anticipated that Peru will increase its exports by more than 50% in 3Q2020 from 2Q2020. What were the main drivers for this accelerated growth, and what are the expectations for 2021?</h4><p>The main driver of this growth is the performance of non-traditional agro exports, standing out for its resistance to the current crisis. In a conservative scenario, this sector is expected to close 2020 with a growth of 1.4% and 2021 with a growth of 6.9%. During the first few months of 2020, there was a huge positive impact on the non-traditional agro sector, driven by value-added products. However, this impact fell over the months because many countries entered into an economic recession, which caused income reductions and consequently a contraction in consumption. One of the key sectors that will drive this development is agro, mainly the food market, which is beginning to opt for products that contribute to improving health, such as citrus products, which strengthen the immune system and so on. In the last few years, this sector has experienced a solid performance. Although the volumes shipped remained stable, Peruvian companies took advantage of the opportunities offered by international markets to increase the value of their products. Therefore, Peru will have a challenging scenario during 2021 and will have to take advantage of the recovery of Asian countries—which are not only resuming their activities but also paying the highest prices for fresh fruits—and European markets. On the other side, one of the markets that will need a great deal of attention is the US, as it is the main destination for non-traditional agro exports shipped from Peru. Finally, the main challenge for Peruvian exporters is discovering new opportunities, and, therefore, one of the strategies to be developed is the creation and use of different digital platforms to determine which purchases have a relevant, essential, and significant impact on the new consumer, as the global context is driving consumers to change their habits and reevaluate their priorities.</p><h4>COVID-19 has forced many companies and institutions to accelerate their digital transformation, PROMPERíš among them. How would you assess your experience with this digital transformation, and what is PROMPERíš's future strategy in this regard?</h4><p>COVID-19 has accelerated the digital transformation that was started a few years ago, which is why we could continue with international promotion activities, despite the global conjuncture. Therefore, PROMPERíš decided to further improve its digital environment; indeed, our main services are now digital. First, we have promoted the virtual implementation of business rounds, where 1,296 exporters and international buyers participated in 27 activities among the food, clothing, manufacturing, services, and fishing industries. This strategy resulted in 2,927 digital business appointments. PROMPERíš has an ambitious future strategy with four main projects: the international promotion of the Peru Marketplace, a digital channel that gathers the best Peruvian exports on offer; the extension of the e-commerce program to boost the participation of more exporters in marketplaces around the world; the implementation of an institutional CRM to build loyalty among our clients that use specialized services; and the automation of information and service management to improve our internal processes through innovative technologies such as big data, blockchain, and AI.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the export potential of Peru's superfoods, promoted under PROMPERíš's Superfoods Peru brand, and how do you see global consumer trends and demand for Peruvian agricultural exports growing?</h4><p>Peruvian agro-exports have great potential; besides being one of the most important international suppliers of several commercially known products such as blueberries, grapes, citrus species, avocados, asparagus, mangos, fish products, and similar, it has many other products still little known in the world that could also promote a healthy lifestyle. Some examples are lucuma, an extraordinary natural energizer rich in niacin that helps the nervous system; goldenberry, which contains antioxidants, vitamins A and C, phosphorus, and potassium that help delay cellular aging and improve the performance of cardiovascular functions; yacón, recommended for hypocaloric and diabetic diets because its consumption promotes the absorption of glucose in the peripheral tissues and improves the sensitivity of insulin; and sacha inchi, which contains an important source of omega 3, 6 and 9 and can help reduce the amount of triglycerides and other fats produced in the liver, among others. The world is now significantly more conscious of the importance of strengthening our immune systems, leading a healthy lifestyle, and adopting a preventive attitude. Superfoods are a key part of our overall health and well-being. Our brand Super Foods Peru seeks to contribute to a healthy lifestyle and plays an important role in promoting our exports, as well as connecting with our international audience. A clear example of this is the Program of Licensees of Country Brand and Sectorial Brands that PROMPERíš has created, where we invite international companies and international brands that commercialize Peruvian products around the world to use our sectorial brands in their products; we invite those interested in licensing the use of these sectorial brands to connect with us via marcapais@promperu.gob.pe.</p><h4>Due to COVID-19 and its related restrictions, there has been an increase in outdoor tourism activities, which are already world class in Peru. What other tourism trends has PROMPERíš identified, and how has this impacted the country's strategy to promote tourism during this period?</h4><p>We are currently focusing on safety, enhancing protocols, and giving priority to adventure tourism, which include outdoors activities like trekking, cycling, and even birdwatching, among others. However, this has always been an important segment for us. For example, the Inca Trail is an emblematic trek that is on any avid adventurer's wish list, so Peru is not new in offering once-in-a-lifetime adventure experiences. However, the current circumstances are indeed driving us to reshape our strategy and see it as a challenge and opportunity to showcase all of what Peru has to offer regarding its natural destinations, like Ancash with its amazing lagoons and mountains, Iquitos with the Amazon river, Lake Titicaca, and our world-renowned beaches, perfect for surfers. And this are just some of all the Peruvian natural wonders. Also, millennial and centennial targets will be the first ones to travel once the borders open, so many of these destinations will fit in perfectly with their adventure and outdoors plans. As for other trends, we also expect a boost in the luxury and gastronomic segment. Given that most people are longing for a proper vacation, full of new experiences, high-quality services and cuisine, as well as a desire to reload energies from this difficult year, we can expect many travelers to head to Cusco, Arequipa, Ica, or Lima, which are wonderful places due to their vast history and nature ranges. When the time is right, we will be able to promote all these experiences widely. On the other hand, what we now know as strict changes will become the new long-term good practices for all. Safety, health, sanitary protocols, insurance coverage, and strict measures will, in the end, benefit travelers and the tourism industry in order to ensure a pleasant trip without any worries.</p><h4>What are PROMPERíš's priorities and goals for the remainder of this year and 2021?</h4><p>Our purpose is to significantly contribute to the recovery of exports, tourism, and business investments to generate employment that Peru needs and to promote our exportable offer, magnificent experiences in tourism, and investment opportunities in our country for our business partners. Peru continues to be a leader in high-end tourism due to its unique cultural heritage, biodiversity and gastronomy, as well as its geographical conditions, being an Amazonian and sustainable country. Companies and financial groups from abroad are increasingly interested in our exportable offers and motivating business investment opportunities. In 2021, the year of the Bicentennial of Peru, we want to ensure biosecurity in our cities for national and international tourism,  promote the perception of Peru as a destination for foreign direct investment, and be the Best Agency in Latin America for UN's International Trade Center's TPO Benchmark.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What methods did the company use to finally break its production benchmark of 1 million tons of copper in 2019 for the first time?</h4><p>There will always be potential for mining growth in Mexico, Peru, and the US. We have seven open-pit mines: two in Mexico, two in Peru, and three in Arizona. Our production in 2019 was, for the first time, over 1 million tons of copper; due to the completed expansion of the second concentrator in Toquepala. This added expansion allowed us to increase our production by 100,000 tons; leading to a grand total of over 1 million tons.</p><h4>What are your expectations for production in 2020?</h4><p>We have about the same expectations. We have three investments in Mexico, one of those will be Buenavista Zinc, we found zinc inside copper, this material needs to be process in a new concentrator. That will increase production and total income in our underground mines in Mexico. The construction of the new concentrator is due to start this year and is expected to be completed in two years with an investment of approximately USD480 million.</p><h4>Are you still contemplating entering new markets such as Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile?</h4><p>We are exploring market opportunities in the mining sector in three other countries. We are currently exploring the opportunity of a copper mining project in Ecuador. We have not taken a final decision, however, and we need to evaluate the long-term benefits this important investment could add to our company. At the moment, we are exploring possibilities, and trying to prove if it will be a substantial project. </p><h4>How will COVID-19 impact your production and performance in 2020?</h4><p>We cannot deny the fact that this global pandemic is affecting our sector, but Americas Mining Corporation already sold 80-85% of our production to Chinese companies in October 2019. The only inconvenience we have encountered is the change of distribution dates because some companies are suggesting that we do not send shipments according to the timing we had already set up. Apart from that, it has not been a problem, since we already signed the contracts. We will send our production following a different timing than we expected, and we hope it will not cause any further problems.</p><h4>What does the mining industry in Mexico need to become more competitive?</h4><p>We consider Mexico already competitive. We are achieving higher production levels in Mexico compared to Peru, mainly in Buenavista del Cobre. Moreover, due to the addition of a new concentrator, we were able to increase our production by more than 100,000 tons of copper. This addition helped us achieve over 1 million tons we produced in 2019. Out of our total production, 60% comes from Mexico, and 40% comes from Peru. Nevertheless, we have three pending projects in Peru: Tí­a Marí­a, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay. They have different dates. In Mexico, we have the Buenavista mine, which is centered in zinc extraction. Furthermore, we have an upcoming small mine project, El Pilar, in Mexico, which is expected to produce 30,000 tons of copper. El Pilar project will start in 2020 and will take at least 1.5 years to produce the amount of copper we expect.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your early investments on online learning—particularly your engaged learning online (ELO) platform—prepared SP Jain for the current educational landscape?</h4><p>About two years ago, we identified adult retraining as one of the fastest growing segments in the field of education. Many jobs are being disrupted because of technology, and adults who do not have the time to physically go to a campus would prefer online education. We decided to provide a learning experience that is close to a physical classroom experience without the need for a classroom, for which there is a big market. We invested heavily in developing this technology and over time refined this ELO technology to what it is today, which is an exact replica of the classroom.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 impacted demand on this platform?</h4><p>In March 2020, we had four ELO studios: two in Mumbai and one each in Dubai and Sydney. Since March, we have added two more studios, one in Singapore and a second in Dubai, and we plan to add another in Singapore and a second in Sydney later this year. We could expand to other places as well. These platforms are getting so busy that we need to constantly expand the number of rooms. When we have these rooms in these different cities, it means we can use the facilities based in these cities but they can teach to a global audience.</p><h4>How has the success of the ELO platform changed your strategy to reach international students?</h4><p>The number-one program that we use this for is something that we call Executive MBA, a part-time online program for working adults. This EMBA engages students as though they are in a classroom and they are doing an EMBA degree from SP Jain. We are looking at geographical expansion in a massive way. Our home market India was previously Mumbai because the campus was based in Mumbai. From Mumbai, we expanded into Delhi, Bangalore, and Hyderabad; however, we are now going right into the interior towns of India because there is no other business school there. Now, the same thing applies to all Gulf countries. The model revolves around expanding geographically. We call it global EMBA (GEMBA). We have students from many different countries all sharing the same classroom, thereby enhancing the learning experience. All of them receive the same learning experience as though the professor is teaching them live in a classroom. Because we have these studios around four cities, we can actually choose the best professor to teach this digital marketing course. It gives us a great deal of flexibility in choosing the right faculty and engaging students in this fashion, which is why we see six-fold growth for online EMBA compared to last year. While many other universities are struggling because of COVID-19 and seeing a decline in the number of students, we see growth because of our technological edge.</p><h4>How will the National Education Policy (NEP) and its greater acceptance of online learning at the higher education level impact educational institutions such as SP Jain?</h4><p>NEP at least signals that the government is interested in the edtech sector and online learning, because in the last two decades or longer, nothing had been updated, and education needs to be updated every year. The government has not gone all the way, however, because it believes education is a service, and educational institutions should be not-for-profit. It is still hindering massive investment into the education sector in India. I do not see leading universities from around the world coming to India even though it is a massive market because they might feel their hands would be tied behind their backs. India is not a Scandinavian country, where the government can fully fund education; a more appropriate model would be Brazil or Malaysia, where around three-quarters of universities are private and for profit. Education, like any other industry, requires investment, and businesses put in investment when there is a profit motive.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision for implementing technological solutions at SP Jain?</h4><p>At our school, we believe there is another factor even more compelling than the pandemic, and that is the rise of technology and AI. The growth of technology and AI is a bigger threat to conventional education, and many people do not get that. SP Jain is investing heavily to develop the future of education because it will be led by robotics and AI. We are focusing on making SP Jain an AI-led business school as opposed to just a business school. We are investing in things like how AI can determine how we select students, how we detect students at risk 10 days into the program and not just before the exams to give them the support they need in a timely way, how we can start with tutorials done by bots and not humans, because a bot can teach students at 3am in the morning if they want or on a Sunday afternoon, and so on. If we make such investments quicker than other universities, students will then come to where there is better quality of service and at a lower price. Fortunately, we have a fantastic IT team as well as a faculty that continues to come up with new ideas, and we are fortunate to have these talented people.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What lessons have been learned from Saudi Arabia's COVID-19 response, and how has the country taken the lead internationally at this time of crisis?</h4><p>The G20 Presidency is a great responsibility that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has taken with pride, humility, and a strong determination to achieve lasting results. The unprecedented health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have made the task of leading the G20 this year even more challenging. However, we are confident we will collectively deliver positive outcomes that will restore hope and give reassurance to people around the world in these challenging times. As the G20 President, Saudi Arabia has spared no time reacting quickly to fight this pandemic. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz convened an Extraordinary Leaders' Summit on March 26, where leaders agreed on an immediate response that was unprecedented in its scope and ambition, demonstrating that the G20 leads the international community in taking decisive actions. Such actions included injecting over USD11 trillion into the global economy, pledging over USD21 billion to support the international fight against the pandemic, including the hunt for a vaccine, extending debt relief to the poorest countries through the Debt Service Suspension Initiative that would allow 73 eligible low-income countries to reallocate USD20 billion toward their imminent health and financial needs, and committing to ensure the flow of vital medical supplies and critical agricultural products across borders. Along with its G20 partners, Saudi Arabia will continue to actively drive the responses to the pandemic and to advance the policies that will lay the foundations for a strong and sustainable recovery.</p><h4>Massive government stimulus has been a consistent feature of the government response across the G20 nations. What will be required in terms of fiscal and monetary policy in this new phase?</h4><p>Our immediate aim was to stabilize the global economy and protect jobs and livelihoods through the unprecedented stimulus package. G20 countries have implemented a large-scale, coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus to support households and firms during the lockdown, finance the health system, and provide a social safety net to the most vulnerable groups.</p><h4>What pieces of the G20's agenda are important to focus on despite the crisis?</h4><p>We started our presidency in 2020 under the forward-looking theme of Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All, with the three ambitious aims of empowering people, safeguarding the planet, and shaping new frontiers. Our overarching theme and associated aims remained essential to overcome this unprecedented global challenge and shape a better future for the world. But the priorities and the means have changed to fit the exigencies of the new reality imposed by COVID-19. Empowering people is at the heart of G20 action through fostering resilience in health care provision, renewing the focus on education, and protecting labor markets, while also prioritizing women and youth empowerment. Safeguarding the planet is a priority as we make growth stronger and more sustainable while conserving our natural resources. Furthermore, we will shape new frontiers by harnessing the benefits of digital technologies, boosting the opportunities for all, and ensuring a better-connected world. The Saudi Presidency has worked to adapt its priorities under its ambitious aims and put forward several important initiatives to ensure that recovery efforts are at the heart of global discussions. In health, our goal is to put in place a global health system that reflects the lessons we have learned and allows us to better deal with future crises. We have advanced the concept of circular carbon economy as a sustainable, pragmatic and cost-effective approach for achieving ambitious climate goals and for ensuring cleaner, more sustainable and affordable energy systems. Nature-based solutions have great potential to help solve the environmental challenges: reducing land degradation and conserving coral reefs are key areas that we are addressing this year in the G20. Saudi Arabia is also advancing important initiatives on both fronts. We adopted the Riyadh Initiative on the future of the WTO reform, which shares a set of common principles to guide the reform process, with the aim of better equipping the rules-based multilateral trading system for the challenges of the present and of the future. We will strive to overcome the pandemic and pave the way for an inclusive, sustainable, resilient, and long-lasting recovery that lays the foundations for a better future that realizes the opportunities of the 21st century for all.</p><h4>Sharing the benefits of technology and innovation is a key focus this year. Which key trends in this area have accelerated this year, and what opportunities lie in the near term as a result?</h4><p>The pandemic has cast light on the vital role that technology plays in our lives. Digital technology has allowed the global economy to continue to function, even partially, during the quarantine and lockdown periods—at the G20, we have shifted to virtual meetings due to travel difficulties. Governments will leverage digital technologies and adopt policies to enable individuals and firms to continue to participate effectively in the economy. Unfortunately, there persists a significant digital divide between genders, regions, and countries. Countries will need to invest in their digital infrastructure and invest in digital skills and continuing education of their people to close the digital skills gap. A key priority will be broadening the access of low-income households and small businesses to financial products—what is known as the digital financial inclusion.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia hosts this year's G20. How do you see the Kingdom on the world stage?</h4><p>With the support of our G20 partners, we have a unique opportunity to make a difference in people's lives and collectively address the world's most pressing challenges. The Riyadh Summit will have a strong overarching focus on protecting lives and livelihoods and recovering stronger. In particular, rising to the challenge together and taking immediate actions such as ensuring universal and equitable access to vaccines; empowering people by ensuring an inclusive recovery that tackles inequalities through fostering resilience and recovery in healthcare provision, renewing the focus on education, social protection and jobs, while also prioritizing women and youth; safeguarding our planet and ensuring sustainability is at the heart of recovery; and building a resilient and long-lasting recovery, ensuring strong foundations for the future by harnessing the benefits of digital technologies, sustaining trade cooperation, and ensuring a better-connected world. We are proud to host G20 Leaders and showcase our determination in building a brighter and better sustainable future for generations to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways was the fund able to support its clients during the pandemic to ensure the continuation of agricultural activities and to contribute to the food security of Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>During this pandemic, ADF announced it was launching three initiatives with an allocation of SAR2.5 billion in line with other National Development Fund subsidiaries to ensure the continuation for agricultural activities and to contribute toward food security in Saudi Arabia. To ensure ample food supply to the Kingdom, ADF introduced the Funding Import of Agricultural Products for the Food Security Strategy, with an allocation of SAR2 billion in a combination of direct and indirect loans through commercial banks. This funding would assist companies with imports to meet the food security demand on essential crops such as rice, sugar, soybean, and corn. ADF also took proactive measures by allocating SAR150 million for loan rescheduling to assist SMEs and ease their burden in meeting their monthly repayments. ADF also allocated SAR300 million for working capital loans to assist specialized projects in ensuring the sustainability of their projects. This initiative also aims to save jobs and ensure the sustainability of food supplies. This initiative comes within the framework of the urgent initiatives approved by the Saudi government to address the impact of COVID-19 and mitigate the economic impact on the private sector and its economic activities, and in line with the Saudi Arabia's National Development Fund (NDF) declarations.</p><h4>How has your outlook on food security changed during the pandemic?</h4><p>Measures put in place to prevent or slow the spread of COVID-19 are disrupting the functioning of food supply chains. Limits on the mobility of people across borders and lockdowns are contributing to food shortages despite solid supplies of staple crops and favorable production crops. The Food Security Strategy, which was the result of institutional work that the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture (MEWA) started more than four years ago following the food crisis in Saudi Arabia in 2008, is reaping its fruits during the current crisis. With the cooperation of MEWA and the enablers from both private sectors and government-related companies such as SALIC and SAGO, ADF and other institutions have been working more aggressively to raise production and improve marketing efficiency. In light of COVID-19, ensuring that the food system is more sustainable and resilient is now an even more urgent priority. MEWA has begun refining the strategies in recent years to combine more targeted overseas investments with the development of technology-backed production at home, particularly for vegetables, fruit, and fish to ensure self-sustainability without affecting scarce natural resources such as water. The consistent supplies of the targeted crops and sensitive crops have become top priority. Emphasis has also been placed on strengthening the logistics and value chain through various program to ensure these crops reach consumers. In addition, MEWA has also built up strategic food reserves and invested in mills, logistics, and production facilities. To further improve this, MEWA and the relevant agencies will need to step up in terms of: financing local and external production and the supply chain; the funding of the agricultural sector to support sustainable rural agricultural development and crop composition according to the relative competitive advantage of the regions; and encouraging the use of modern techniques and practices to conserve natural resources and improve agricultural productivity through distinctive partnerships with cooperatives, the private sector, and research centers. Today, the Kingdom has one of the largest storage capacities in the Middle East for wheat and flour, with more than 3.3 million tons. The Kingdom possess trustworthy food supply chains capable of daily production that can satisfy consumers even at international standards.</p><h4>How is the ADF positioning itself in regard to Saudi Vision 2030 goals?</h4><p>It is critical for us as a country that we have one vision. In agriculture, we have two major focuses: food security and overall sector development. We support food security with the help of the Ministry of Agriculture and MEWA. We also launched other programs such as the Rural Development Program. Through this program, we provide loans for small farmers, thus creating jobs in the rural areas of Saudi Arabia. As Saudi Arabia is a huge country, with diverse climates from one area to another, we agreed with the ministry to develop the competitive advantage of each region depending on what each is best at. This development strategy is vital for food security. Currently, we are self-sufficient in some products such as eggs and dates. We are also in a good position for poultry and dairy in general; however, we still have some challenges regarding water, so ADF's role in the new food security strategy envisioned in the vision is to provide loans for infrastructure.</p><h4>What projects do you fund to promote and encourage better usage of water?</h4><p>One of our strategies over the last two years has been giving incentives for people to transfer to technology to monitor their water usage. One way to use technology to save water is through using hydroponic greenhouses, which can save up to 90% of the water consumption needed. This will help the farm to produce more while using less water. This type of technology is not just for the greenhouses but all activities, including poultry and aquaculture. By using new technology, one can help save natural resources, either water or land, and increase productivity. All of this contributes to the country's food security. Additionally, these technologies will help with sustainability, because you are using resources more efficiently. Technology improves every year, and agriculture, like any other industry, is adopting new technology. We see great technology being used in greenhouses and in irrigation systems, which helps small farmers save water as well. In terms of irrigation systems, there are many different systems employing different technologies. As such, we have new products for irrigation systems as well. These products will have a huge impact on sustainability in the agriculture business.</p><h4>Are there programs specific to Saudi Arabia for agriculture?</h4><p>There are two different strategies we have devised with MEWA: The National Water Strategy and The National Agriculture Strategy. Each one has different stakeholders. The water strategy involves the farmer, the ADF, and all the people. Meanwhile, the agriculture strategy involves the farmer and industry, because you are turning agricultural products into food at the end of the day. You also need the FDA, commercial banks, and traders because you need products from outside. We have continuous support to achieve these strategies. In the agriculture strategy, we try to find products that are suited to our climate. We a great advantage in poultry farms and greenhouses because of our climate. We also have an aquaculture advantage in the fishery business because we have long been developing the sector. As for food security, because some products do not fit our climate, we decided to support Saudi businessmen to invest in nearby countries depending on the products offered. This will help both with food security and sustainability.</p><h4>How will the ADF transform agricultural production in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>It takes more than funding to change the people and the culture to adopt new technology. Especially in talking to small farmers in rural areas, it might be a challenge to change them. But we work closely with other organizations to promote best practices in agriculture. The ministry has an initiative called the Saudi Gap in agriculture about how to produce and grow products the best way in Saudi Arabia. This initiative will help farmers to implement more technology; from our end, we will provide increased funding. This is an incentive to change but still, it is not easy. However, if we create good examples, people will follow. We also need help from universities all around the country to promote best practices in agriculture using technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Pernod Ricard has grown significantly within the local market over the last five years. How would you describe the evolution of the company in Mozambique so far?</h4><p>Pernod Ricard Mocambique was established in 2015, and, as with any other new business, it had its challenges, especially as we started operating one year after the market entered a recession. We had to adapt our business plan to accommodate the new environment. Being a young and agile company, we managed to adapt quickly and refocus our energy on the right opportunities. Since 2015, Pernod Ricard has worked on strengthening its presence in the market with the right brands for its consumers. We also worked on strengthening our relationship with our customers who play a key role within our business to achieve our objectives. We went through three phases within this five-year period. The first phase was the implementation phase, where we put in place what we had designed on paper. These were our business plans and ambitions, along with starting to build a strong team and a better understanding of the environment we were playing in. With the knowledge we had acquired, we started on the second stage: to understand the needs of the market and consumers and bring in the right propositions and brands at the right moment. The third phase is consolidating our business in terms of where we stand today. This is where we implement innovations and establish the business as a key player and leader in spirits. Pernod Ricard is the leader in the market in terms of value proposition. We are also quickly rising to become the market leaders in terms of volume in spirits. That is an great achievement in five years.</p><h4>After opening its South African branch in 1993, Pernod Ricard began expanding its presence on the continent. What potential do you see in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique offers massive potential in several sectors. If we look at trends in the alcoholic beverages market over the last five years, in the beer segment there is a new brewery company entering and an expansion of Mozambique's traditional brewery industry. There have also been investments in spirits. Within the sector, there is a huge dynamism because consumers are becoming more aware of what they want and are more demanding. They are exposed to developments in other countries and global trends. In the wider economy, we are talking about an emerging middle class with strong purchasing power and a clear idea of the type and quality of products they want to consume. Pernod Ricard plays in the value-added category. As a French company, we have a premium products portfolio and that is where we can offer the best experience to consumers. We are creators of conviviality. For us, it is about the moments we create for our consumers—moments of joy, socializing, and conviviality. We established Pernod Ricard Mozambique as an affiliate in Africa because Africa is more than just the next Asia; it is growing faster than the rest of the world. This is where the opportunity lies. By establishing our position here early and supporting this emerging growth, we will definitely be in a strong position to have our say in the market.</p><h4>French companies are growing their presence in Mozambique. Is it an asset for Pernod Ricard to grow its market share?</h4><p>It is important. We are seeing a growth in the French presence and its relevance within the country's economic environment. It is important that we and other French companies in Mozambique grow together, as we have experience from other markets, both in Africa and worldwide. We can easily apply some of that experience here. It can be a leverage at some points, though it is not the single factor that will determine growth in the market. The primary factor is we need to understand the market and localize. Pernod Ricard has localized to the Mozambican reality, both in terms of our structure and the assets and resources we put in place.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 affected Pernod Ricard's operations and workplace productivity?</h4><p>The social distancing restrictions imposed by the government directly affected the alcoholic beverages sector in Mozambique. First, it affected the consumption trade, because bars and nightclubs were closed down, and they form the bulk of the business for us—up to 70% for some companies in the sector. The second impact was on consumer behavior. If customers cannot reach your products easily, naturally they migrate to products that are readily available or at some point they reduce consumption. That is the reality for the entire alcohol sector, including spirits, wines, and beers; however, the sector also saw this as an opportunity. Because there is no traditional e-commerce platform in Mozambique per se, what happened was a boom in delivery services and a massive increase in the use of social media to research about products. Social media platforms almost became e-commerce platforms. This was fantastic for brands, though it was also a new challenge. Our consumers were no longer choosing at the point of consumption but instead had time to think about and choose brands via the digital world. They were looking at social media to see who was recommending what. This requires a different approach and way of communicating, so we reinvented ourselves to accommodate this. Pernod Ricard strengthened its presence in the digital space and built partnerships with delivery services to become more competitive and responsive to consumers' needs. In the last few months, with the easing of some of the restrictions, the sector has been responding positively compared to the first three months of the pandemic. However, 2020 will still be the worst year ever for the sector.</p><h4>What are Pernod Ricard's main goals and priorities for 4Q2020 and 2021?</h4><p>We have adapted to the pandemic and are resetting our business. It is the start of the fiscal year for us, and we have an understanding of the consumer dynamics. For the remainder of 2020, we want to implement the “new, new." This means we will provide our consumers with different experiences tailor-made to this current situation because they need us more than ever. They need a moment of conviviality and socializing to overcome the daily challenges relating to COVID-19 and this new norm.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved since it was created in at the end of 2018?</h4><p>Since I was 18, I have been interested in hairdressing, aesthetics, and eventually aesthetic medicine. I am the son of a hairdresser, and I gradually moved into the commercial area of aesthetic medicine. In 2017, while researching hair transplants for myself, I realized it was difficult to find a good product in Spain that had a suitable price quality relation. Prices were close to EUR8,000 in Spain, and no product offered the guarantee that Turkey did. In Turkey, I found the results that Spain could not offer, so I went to Turkey in 2017 to get the procedure done. Since then, my obsession for this business has grown further. I went to find equipment, developed a marketing strategy, and hired a team. It was an extremely difficult process. In fact, many companies have tried to implement this model in Spain and have been unsuccessful.</p><h4>What are the main challenges in establishing this business in Spain?</h4><p>One of the main challenges is that there is no one to copy from, so we had to go to Turkey. In Turkey, we hired the best specialists, and we combined them with the best that Spain has to offer, which is its healthcare system. We combined the Turkish technique with the excellent healthcare practice in Spain. We then improved Turkey's technique. My market study was 48 friends whom I sent to different Turkish clinics to get real feedback. Then, I went to Turkey to study the sector, and I met with doctors and nurses and learned about the procedure. We train our staff ourselves, because that provides a better result.</p><h4>MC360 has become the leader in Spain in hair transplant with the FUE technique. How would you describe your services?</h4><p>The surgery most commonly used in our clinic is the FUE technique. It is a hair restoration process in which hair follicles are extracted from the donor's head. The difference between Spain and Turkey is that in Spain we care greatly for the donor area, while Turkey does not. In Spain, we produce a so-called hybrid process. We do not lie about the number of hair units that we will transplant. Right now, what differentiates us from our competitors is that we have copied the Turkish model. We can perform surgeries of 4,000 units within a day, whereas with other procedures such an amount would take two days. We attempt to transplant a large amount of hair units in the quickest time possible but always with the higher quality standards.</p><h4>Previously, some 500,000 people traveled to Turkey annually to undergo hair transplant. What has been the impact of the pandemic on MC360's operations?</h4><p>In March 2020, when the lockdown was implemented, we thought it would last for two weeks, when in fact it lasted almost three months. The pandemic has hit our revenue forecast for 2020. We lost EUR1 million in revenue during the lockdown, and in an attempt to recover the lost market share, we have hired more staff, invested more in digital marketing, and expanded our facilities. We have now in fact surpassed our pre-COVID-19 revenue forecast. This success was due to the reduction in the number of flights to Turkey, our investment in TV and online advertisement, and our operation's expansion. Nearly 24% of our monthly patients are referrals, and that is extremely important to us. We are commercializing 200 interventions per month, and 50 of those are referrals from previous patients. Another important achievement was the agreement we signed with Tahe Group. That is important to us because we now have 1,500 partner hair salons that can help us get clients. The salons do not provide the hair transplant service, but recommend this treatment to our potential patients. We will end the year with more than EUR1 million in EBITDA, which is higher our initial projections of EUR400,000. Our projection is for 2021 is EUR3.5 million.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans?</h4><p>We have two projects, one in the US and another in Europe. In Europe, we want to implement the same model in Spain with the Tahe Group to find different spots in Portugal, the UK, France, and Spain to capture more clients. In 2022, we want to open a clinic in Puerto Vallarta or Panama focused on American tourists. Puerto Vallarta is a spot for medical tourism, and there are currently many Americans flying to Turkey; we believe there could be an opportunity for these services in Puerto Vallarta and Panama. Such surgery can cost USD25,000 in the US, so we feel we can capture these clients from the US and Latin America. In 2021, we want to start with the research process, at the same time also creating our own academy. This will not be a private academy for other centers, but to provide trained workers for us.</p><h4>What is your main priority for next year?</h4><p>The main priority is to open the European market and to capture European clients in order to turn Madrid into an important location for this business. We always seek to double our growth and increase from 12 operation rooms to 24. We have a pilot program for Murcia because it is one of the isolated cities in Spain. Murcia is an autonomous community, and we were not receiving many patients from Murcia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ASSECO PST evolved in the last two years, and what have been its main achievements?</h4><p>ASSECO PST is a subsidiary of ASSECO Poland, one of the largest European software producers with presence in many sectors of the economy. In Portugal we are focused primarily on the banking sector. We are an end-to-end software and services provider for financial institutions with an extensive offer that ranges from a core banking solution, to payment hubs, internet banking, mobile banking and more. While we are based in Portugal, we work extensively with all of the Portuguese-speaking countries with the exception of Brazil. One of our long-term goal is to also establish ourselves in Brazil but do not work there yet. The last two years were fantastic, and we managed to grow on all of the key performance indicators. The banking sector has been going through a technological transformation over the last few years, and, as a consequence, there has been significant investment in the sector. Given that we have an offer that is very much aligned with the needs of the sector we benefited greatly from the increased demand that was generated during the last 2 years.</p><h4>How has COVID-19 affected ASSECO, and what has been your strategy to mitigate its impact?</h4><p>2019 was our best year ever in terms of company results, and, for 2020, we were forecasting 4% net revenue growth. Unfortunately, it will not materialize this way, and this is directly related to COVID-19. As a result, we do not expect the same level of growth that we were expecting in the past. What we have noticed is that immediately after COVID-19 emerged only the more significant projects were executed, and many customers chose to delay new projects entirely. On the other hand, we also noticed that COVID-19 served has a catalyst to digital transformation initiatives that were already present in many financial institutions. Therefore, while we noticed that all projects non-related to digital transformation were put on hold, the ones that fell under this umbrella took maximum priority. We naturally had to adapt to this change in priority from our customers and, while digital transformation projects have been part of our offer for many years, today we place even more emphasis on this offer than we did prior to Covid-19.</p><h4>At the end of September, Asseco PST conducted a webinar for the banking sector in several Portuguese-speaking countries called “Digital, the new banking standard: challenges in a time of change." What was the result of this webinar?</h4><p>The result was fantastic. It is an extremely pertinent topic that interests financial institutions on multiple levels, namely going digital, the COVID-19 crisis, and customers wanting to be digital. At the end of the day, since the financial sector in general is also evolving, with fintechs and large tech companies entering the banking sector, all this is placing pressure on banks to be more digitalized than they were in the past. There is strong interest in at least hearing what we can do as a company to help our customers in this regard. We had participants from the four continents where we do business. We had a large audience, and the webinar went according to plan.</p><h4>What role has played technology to maintain a positive growth trajectory in this complicated time?</h4><p>Technology is absolutely paramount in ensuring that society does not break down in general. This is a positive as well as a negative factor. It is positive because we are able to maintain digital connections; all of a sudden, everyone is video-conferencing and as a society we feel more connected than we felt previously. At the same time, society is getting used to this non-contact environment, which personally is not something I like to advocate as we seem to be losing the human touch which at the end of the day is what makes us humans. I am personally hoping that once COVID-19 is brought under control we may revert back to the positive aspects of these human connections which are now being substituted by these digital connections.</p><h4>Which services are the most promising for the future, and what new products are in the pipeline?</h4><p>By and large, anything that has to do with client facing and with simplifying processes for the end customer of the financial institutions will continue to be strong areas of growth. As I mentioned earlier, digital transformation projects will continue to be a top priority as these will be the primary driver of the investments that banks will make. Naturally, our development pipeline will follow this important driver.</p><h4>Is this what you are mostly focusing on now?</h4><p>Yes, digital has been a major area of focus of not only our company but the entire financial sector and companies that work with financial institutions. Another area that we see growing significantly is security, because as soon as you go digital, you embrace a whole different layer of security. Other growth areas include open banking as well as Payments which are both areas where we are very active.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for the rest of the year and for 2021?</h4><p>The key priorities are to maintain our efficiency, make sure we address customers' needs in the best way possible, and have a positive outlook for the future. There is a saying in Portuguese, “nío há mal que sempre dure nem bem que nunca acabe," which translates as “bad times don't last forever and good times also come to an end." In general, we keep a positive outlook despite challenging times we face as a society right now. We have to focus more on efficiency and perhaps manage expectations that growth will not materialize the way we anticipated. Now, it is more a question of stability and efficiency in order to prepare for the next wave of growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the development plan for Bayan College and how is Bayan College prepared to contribute to 2040 vision? </h4><p>Working to accomplish the Oman Vision 2040, our vision is to recruit more international students which will contribute to the development of the economy. Higher education institutes (HEI) have a huge impact on a country's overall comprehensive development. In Oman, my focus towards the development of HEI is to recruit more students from different countries. We have taken different initiatives to recruit from Asian countries. Oman is ranked both the safest and the friendliest country in the world for expatriates to live and work, according to a new global report that looks at the countries that are the most welcoming of foreign nationals. This is an advantage that creates peaceful environment for international students to pursue their higher studies in Oman. </p><h4>Where is the media industry in Oman heading, and how are you adjusting to the trends in the sector? </h4><p>In media, having an international perspective is crucial, which is why we send our students to Germany, Tunisia, Jordan, Qatar, and Lebanon for intensive 10-day media programs every year. At the same time, we make sure our students stay up to date in terms of advancements, technology, knowledge, and information trends. Bayan College was also the founder of the Arab-European Association for Media and Communication Researchers (AREACORE). All communication professors and representatives that belong to it meet annually to exchange knowledge and participate in workshops, presentations, lectures, and networking. Meanwhile, we also intend for our students to adopt the positives of the media trends of our neighboring countries. However, Oman has its own personality, and Omani media worker should take that into consideration. Blending this international and local touch is thus paramount to grow future media professionals, which is why our teachings are in English and Arabic. </p><h4>What role will the private education segment in Oman play in the medium term, and what gaps can be filled by the private sector? </h4><p>Education has always been the top priority of His Excellency, the Late Sultan Qaboos' leadership. The private higher education sector has the ability to fulfill his vision, and position Oman as the leading knowledge hub in the region. The private higher education sector will align its work with Oman Vision 2040 and ensure a vibrant and high-quality educational system with communal partnerships with national and international bodies is maintained and strengthened.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>India passed its ambitious and wide-ranging education reform in July 2020. What is your vision for the role of technology for this reform, both in implementing NEP and as a focus of NEP itself?</h4><p>Technology has become an integral part of the Ministry of Education. With each passing day, the scope of technology is set to widen like never before. With regard to NEP 2020, the Education Ministry embarked on a digital consultative process throughout the country, with over INR2.75 lakh direct consultations, both online and offline. As proposed in NEP, technology will play an important role in education processes and outcomes. An autonomous body, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), will be created to provide a platform for the free exchange of ideas on the use of technology to enhance learning, assessment, planning, administration, and so on, both for school and higher education. Furthermore, a rich variety of educational software will be developed and made available for students and teachers at all levels. All such software will be available in all major Indian languages and will be accessible to a wide range of users including students in remote areas and Divyang students. NEP also recommends key initiatives such as conducting pilot studies for online education; the creation of open, interoperable, and adaptable public digital infrastructure; a concentrated focus on content creation, a digital repository, and dissemination; providing training and incentives for teachers; and online assessment and examinations, among others. Existing platforms and ongoing ICT-based educational initiatives such as SWAYAM, Diksha, and the National Repository of Open Educational Resources (NROER) will be optimized and expanded. The future of education is a blended mode of education. The ministry has already started various initiatives in the same vein, be it PRAGYATA guidelines, Learning Enhancement Guidelines, or the education learning apps as mentioned above.</p><h4>What is your ministry's strategy to further adopt the various available education technologies during COVID-19?</h4><p>The unprecedented disruption caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has set off an accelerated move toward online teaching that may lead to a shift away from the traditional textbook-based classroom. Digital learning tools and technology have helped us enrich the teaching-learning process. Digitalization in the education industry has changed the learning and teaching process to a great extent. The school closures necessitated the incorporation of multi-modal methods of teaching and learning to ensure no child is denied of education. In view of AtmaNirbhar Bharat (Self-reliant India), the policy emphasizes leveraging the advantages of technology to meet current and future challenges in providing equitable and quality education. Accordingly, the ministry will further augment initiatives like DIKSHA (One nation, one digital platform), Swayam Prabha (One class, one channel), online education, and others under the E-Vidya initiative of Atmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan.</p><h4>How would you describe the current ecosystem for Indian start-ups in the edtech sector and the level of communication/collaboration between the private edtech sector and the relevant public authorities?</h4><p>NEP proposes major transformation for digital education and supports edtech. NEP proposes the formation of an autonomous body, the National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), to provide a platform for the free exchange of ideas on the use of technology to enhance learning, assessment, planning, administration, and so on, both for school and higher education. The aim of NETF is to facilitate decision making on the induction, deployment, and use of technology by providing to the leadership of education institutions, state, and central governments, and other stakeholders the latest knowledge and research as well as the opportunity to consult and share best practices. In a recent development, CBSE Skill Education and Training partnered with Google to enable 1 million teachers in 22,000 schools to deliver a blended learning experience, namely a combination of online learning and classroom approach. CBSE also partnered with Facebook to launch a certified curriculum on digital safety and Augmented Reality (AR) for students and educators across India. To make e-learning more constructive, NCERT and Rotary India also digitally signed an MoU for e-learning content telecast for class 1-12 overall NCERT TV channels. In other initiatives, the government of India also launched a national program VidyaDaan 2.0 to invite e-learning content contributions. Steps have been undertaken to ensure quality, accessible, and inclusive education for all. This is just the start; India will definitely establish itself as a knowledge superpower.</p><h4>The Ministry of Education is also administering the new Academic Bank of Credit, which, among many other things, should greatly enhance the access and viability of online education. What is your outlook on the long-term impact of the ABC?</h4><p>During COVID-19, forecasting the needs of the future, we have already shifted to enable massive open online course (MOOC) of SWAYAM for credit transfers while ensuring the three cardinal principles of the NEP—access, equity, and quality. The courses delivered through SWAYAM are interactive, prepared by more than 1,000 specially chosen faculty and teachers in the country and are accessible to any learner free of cost. Upon successful completion, the grades secured in this proctored examination can be transferred to the students' academic record from the host institute. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued UGC Regulation 2016 advising universities to identify courses where credits can be transferred to the academic records of students for courses done on SWAYAM. The step is in line with the recommendation of NEP to establish an academic bank of credit (ABC) to digitally accumulate the academic credits earned from various recognised HEIs so that degrees from an HEI can be awarded taking into account the credits earned.</p><h4>Starting from Class 6, coding as a subject has been added to the national curriculum. What impact do you foresee this having for India's human capital in tech and general competitiveness in the 21st century global economy?</h4><p>As mentioned in NEP, math and mathematical thinking will be extremely important for India's future and its leadership role in the numerous upcoming fields and professions that will involve AI, machine learning, data science, and so on. Thus, math and computational thinking will be given increased emphasis throughout the school years, starting with the foundational stage, through a variety of innovative methods, including the regular use of puzzles and games that make mathematical thinking more enjoyable and engaging. Thereby, activities involving coding will be introduced in the middle stage, upskilling students as per the needs and demands of the 21st century.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove the founding of SDAIA, and what makes the authority's structure and governance unique?</h4><p>The National Information Center (NIC) was the basis of this authority, and it was once housed in the Ministry of Interior. His Royal Highness wanted to evolve NIC into a national data bank that could provide insights to decision-makers. In May 2018, we started working to develop this national data bank concept; however, there is no use in having a national data bank without the ability to unlock the value of data. This capability was based on AI and data science. We also wanted to have a government cloud (G-Cloud). There are three layers: the government cloud provides the foundational infrastructure to host all the government data; on top of that we have the national data bank which is the structured data lake connected all relevant datasets from all government entities; and then finally, we have the insights and intelligence layer, or what we call Estishraf platform, which brings the power of advanced analytics and AI to extract deep insights. We also needed to regulate the data, enable the ministries and the governmental entities to start sharing open data and keep it safe. Thus, we established the National Data Management Office (NDMO), as the regulator. Then, we needed an innovative arm in order to come up with new AI-based solutions and innovations; therefore we established the National Center for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI). That means SDAIA is composed of three main components: the legislative arm NDMO; the operational arm NIC; and the innovative arm NCAI. NCAI also has another function, which is building human capital and upskilling fresh graduates in the area of AI. This is a significant challenge because AI is almost based on human capital. When we looked at benchmarking worldwide, we found ourselves almost unique in establishing one entity that can accommodate data and AI with both a legislative account and innovation.</p><h4>How did the pandemic change the position of SDAIA, and how did you participate in the coronavirus response?</h4><p>When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived, we had just been established, and we were asked to do many things and to do them urgently. We had to turn the Global AI Summit to be fully online and begin work immediately. We were tasked with three main things, the first of which was to help decision-makers. The Ministry of Health needed more data about people, what countries they came from, the percentage of people that got infected in these countries, where they worked, and so on. We had all this data since 2018, and it was much easier for us to provide these entities with this information than it would have been in the past. The second thing was to contain the pandemic. So, we developed a tool to help manage the curfew and allow people to gain permission to go out to do their necessary tasks under certain rules and regulations. This was also the case for government and private-sector employees who have to go to work. We developed a mobile app called Tawakkalna (In God we trust), and it was a six-month project that we had to do in 10 days. When we developed the application, we trained more than 50,000 governmental and private-sector employees to use it. This enabled all Saudi citizens and residents to use this mobile app to issue e-permits that could be shown to security officers on the streets. At the same time, we developed another application called Tabaud for exposure notifications using a framework from Google and Apple. This solution is based on Bluetooth; when people are infected, they can notify others automatically. We also had to work in parallel with another dedicated team to develop a secure video conferencing system (Boroog) for the government, the Council of Ministers, and the G20 Summit to hold its first virtual meeting in April. The pandemic gave us an extremely rapid start as an authority, and we did an incredible amount of work in a short time.</p><h4>How does your mandate help different government entities and ministries to cooperate?</h4><p>The G-Cloud does not only accommodate data but also allows coordination between different sectors. When the Ministry of Finance wants to see data from the Ministry of Education, we facilitate that. We decided as a principle that data should be saved in a single source. Educational data should be saved by the Ministry of Education, and any other ministries requiring this information can easily find it. The same applies to the Ministry of Labor regarding employees' information, the Ministry of Health regarding health records, and so on. The benefits of being integrated through a national data bank have already been realized within the government, and it will lead to more important advancements. In the coming months, we will host and utilize increasing amounts of data from various parts of the government . We have already accomplished a great deal but have much more to do in the coming years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Indeed, after his graduation from ESC Bordeaux (now KEDGE Business School) in France, he joined Promamec in 2003, holding various commercial positions to become general manager in 2006. Since then, Naoufal has driven the development of Promamec by increasing its turnover from 60 million dirhams in 2006 to 440 million dirhams in 2018 notwithstanding the growing and harsh competition this sector has witnessed ever since.  The sustained growth he initiated covered not only company revenue, but also its reputation as Promamec won a national quality prize in 2012, the international prize of ESSEC in 2016 for managerial innovation and the best employer brand prize in 2018.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<url><![CDATA[naoufal-lahlou-general-manager-promamec]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was Promamec founded and what is the status of the company today?</h4><p>The company was established in 1981 by my father after he identified a big market gap in the healthcare sector. The company started with only three people and has grown to almost 300 people after 40 years, generating MAD450 million in revenue last year.</p><h4>Who are your main stakeholders, and do you have any international expansion plans?</h4><p>Two of our main focuses are exports and the international development of the business. We currently generate 5-10% of our revenue through exports. Before, we simply worked with a few companies that requested a certain product from us, but one year ago we decided to hire an export manager to take care of our expansion. We are exploring business opportunities in many sub-Saharan countries. Another part of our vision is the development of the Promamec brand. Johnson &amp; Johnson is one of our oldest partners; for years, we have been recognized and identified as distributors of brands such as 3M, Konica Minolta, and Baxter, among others. At present, we are striving to develop the Promamec brand as a real value-added partner and not only as a distributor of these brands.</p><h4>How important is innovation to the company's success?</h4><p>Our mission is to improve the access and quality of healthcare provided to all our patients and citizens. Innovation is definitely a big part of it, and we use innovation to add value to our devices; this differentiates us in the market. Our partners use this to maintain their leading position in all of their fields as well. All our partners are innovative companies with whom we share and discuss new technologies and techniques on an annual basis. Our marketing department has a medical division with many specialized doctors that enable us to promote these innovations and build a bridge between what the manufacturers are doing in their countries around the world and what we are doing in Morocco. Our medical division gets in touch with our partners to get all the data and then adapt it to the local market.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the challenges in the Moroccan healthcare sector, and what barriers or opportunities do you see?</h4><p>One of the main challenges in Morocco are unexpected changes that can affect our business plans and activities. Such changes force us to postpone some strategic decisions and projects. We have no other choice unfortunately than to adapt and wait until the dust settles. Fortunately, we do not start over from scratch, as there are always people in charge willing to push relevant and strategic projects. This also depends on the overall economy. Since Morocco's economy depends heavily on agriculture, the economy fluctuates on a yearly basis. Due to the type of projects we work on, this can be a challenge for us sometimes. We are starting to discuss with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and also with the Healthcare Ministry to find a solution for this and incentivize the local manufacturers. This can be a real game changer and turning point in terms of the development of the local medical devices industry. In the private sector, one of the main challenges is payment terms. It is harming our working capital and for a long time it has slowed down our growth. We always keep around USD10 million worth of stock for our customers' needs. This figure is part of our working capital, which is key to any company's development. Notably, in 2018, we started hosting a private equity company called Africa Invest, which injected money in our capital and helped us accelerate the growth of the company. We now have the capital to catch a number of opportunities that we could not seize before due to less working capital.</p><h4>What are your goals and objectives for 2020?</h4><p>Our major focus in 2020 will be exports to Africa. We have spent one year exploring opportunities across the continent. There are plenty of opportunities but the majority of them are hard to capture. The key to being successful in African countries is being patient and working hard to find the right networks to build a sustainable business. The potential profit in African markets is in direct correlation with the risks and challenges attached. Our human capital is our real differentiation factor; our export team is able to overcome these challenges and realize the opportunities on offer.</p><h4>Which countries in Africa are you targeting?</h4><p>Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Gabon and surrounding countries like Mali, Mauritania, and Chad, where we have already participated in some tenders. We have had some opportunities in Ghana as well. We are closely following the opportunities we identified over the past 12 months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TEC Container has become one of the benchmarks in the design, manufacture, and commercialization of naval engineering and port equipment in more than 80 countries. Can you elaborate on the company's history and its milestones?</h4><p>We have been operating for nearly 45 years. The company was founded by my father, and I am the second generation. There have been two phases, the first one is until the late 1990s, which goes hand in hand with the buoyant times that Spain experienced. We were heavily focused on exports. We have been an exporting company since our creation. In the second phase, after the 1990s, Eastern European and Asian countries started to emerge, and as a result, Spain lost its attractiveness as a cheap place for manufacturing. It became expensive to manufacture in Spain, so we started to seek opportunities abroad, first in some Eastern European countries and then in China, where we started to manufacture what we previously produced in Spain. Until the 1990s, we were a labor-intensive company, with 50-60 workers in our plant, though that ended when the Chinese labor force appeared. We also started to invest in port technology for container management in Spain. We decided to manufacture high-technology products here, while producing low-technology products in China. Margins are more appealing and attractive in added-value products. We invest in research and development, and we manufacture some sophisticated products, while also manufacturing in China some basic lines.</p><h4>The company has a wide portfolio of products and three brands under the umbrella of the main brand: containerspreaders.com; lashingcages.com, and ohframes.com. What products are the most in demand, and how do they differ from your competitors?</h4><p>We have a first business, lashing, which is to secure the containers loaded in the vessels. The containers are secured one to another using a system is called lashing, and we manufacture that in China. That was our core business until mid '90s. It is a well-known standard, a commodity. that no one wants to change. Nowadays TEC is very active in the Handling and Lifting equipment Industry, container spreaders and Overheight Frames that are attachments used in the cranes when the cargo is bigger than a container. Additionally, we produce Safety equipment for the stevedores, such as Lashing Platforms etc. I can proudly say that we are the market leaders in the world in Overheigth Frames and Lashing Cages for stevedores.</p><h4>You export to more than 80 markets, the majority of which is in Europe. What is the company's vision in terms of expanding its market share?</h4><p>Last March, we were going to open a new working night shift because we were overwhelmed. We had a large portfolio of requests before the pandemic started. We are currently experiencing peak demand. The port industry is affected, but I do not feel fear, because things will get better, and trade will be the first thing to improve. People will immediately want to import goods from China or other countries. I am optimistic. We have not seen the cancellation of large investments; instead, products that we planned to hand over in June were postponed to the end of the year. Due to this increase in demand, TEC Container is seeking investors for a capital increase to finance an expansion and go into a larger plant in Madrid of around 15,000-16,000sqm.</p><h4>COVID-19 has affected all sectors of the economy, including port traffic, which fell 4.7% in 1Q2020. What are your views for the rest of the year?</h4><p>2019 was a record for us, and we were headed in the same trajectory for 2020. This has been a parenthesis, but I am extremely optimistic for when the period finishes. Spain in particular will see an impact in trade, though we are currently focused 85% on exports. The ports of Algeciras, Valencia, and Barcelona have investments that were urgent at the time, but they have been put off. Spain will perform worse, but I am optimistic.</p><h4>What measures has the company taken in the light of COVID-19?</h4><p>I am extremely proud and pleased to say that during the pandemic, instead of cutting back on our staff, thankfully, we have been increasing our staff and creating new positions, even during the full lockdown. Blue-collar workers continued coming in, while we implemented a remote working plan for white-collar workers. We have not seen our revenue fall.</p><h4>What are your views on the measures implemented by the government for port operators?</h4><p>I have no opinion on the matter. The government's plan involved EUR350 million, which is small. We have to understand that Spain has a port infrastructure that is one of the best in the world. Algeciras and Valencia rank among the top 50 ports in the world. Same as Germany and more than any other European Country, Holland, Uk and Belgium have 1 port and the rest of our neighbors do not have any. We have an enormous potential in this country, and EUR350 million in aid, taking into account the size of the business, is not relevant.</p><h4>What is your key priority for 2021?</h4><p>My main goal is to stabilize our operations during the current situation to ensure our growth trajectory. We also want to focus our efforts on getting the 15,000-sqm plant in Madrid sorted. This will give us 20-25 more successful years for the company. We call it the TEC 2022 plan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Owl Ventures is the world's largest edtech-focused venture capital firm, holding investments all over the world. What role do you see India's edtech sector playing in Owl Venture's long-term investment strategy?</h4><p>At approximately USD6 trillion, the education market is the second-largest market in the world, and it has been experiencing a significant surge in digital penetration. Some of the world's leading edtech companies are being started in the Indian ecosystem. The meteoric growth of both WhiteHat Jr and Byju are illustrative of that rapidly growing and maturing edtech market in India and throughout the world. Additionally, rapid changes in the global economy have led enterprises and adult learners to seek digital tools for upskilling and reskilling. This has created a multitude of opportunities for innovative companies in the career mobility and professional learning sectors. Owl Ventures is excited to continue to invest in the region. Our strategy is to make early-growth and later-stage investments in the world's leading edtech companies across the education spectrum, namely everything from pre-K through 12 to higher education and the future of work, which includes career mobility and professional learning. We seek to partner with visionary entrepreneurs that are tackling large problems in education as well as training and helping build transformative category-leading companies.</p><h4>What are the key factors for Owl Ventures when considering different markets to enter at this stage?</h4><p>We take a comprehensive perspective when making these investment decisions. India is definitely an innovation hub when it comes to creating top-tier edtech companies. With one of the largest student populations in the world, increasing access to the internet and connected devices, and the tremendous importance being placed on education, India has all the key factors necessary to create a vibrant edtech ecosystem. And that can serve learners not only in India, but globally as well. Additionally, on the regulatory side with the National Education Policy 2020 coming into effect, certain policies—such as universities in India being able to offer fully online degrees—are also extremely conducive to creating edtech companies. Finally, the rapid changes taking place in the global economy as well as in India will require enterprises and adults to seek digital tools for upskilling and reskilling, and this will create a multitude of opportunities for innovative firms within edtech in India. Owl Ventures is excited about these investment opportunities across all areas within the India edtech ecosystem. There is an exciting path forward in this sector in India.</p><h4>What are you looking out for in terms of how India's government is implementing its new National Education Policy?</h4><p>There are a few things. One is that this is an introduction into online education for India; for example, only a limited set of colleges and universities have been given the green light to offer online degrees. We will need to see how that initial batch fares and what expansion to make this available to the entire education ecosystem will look like. The second point is that quality really matters. Where we have seen this go awry in other parts of the world is when people start to prioritize other factors over the quality of the education being delivered and the outcomes. We take learner outcomes extremely seriously at Owl Ventures in the investments we make. The companies in this space that will be the most valuable are the ones actually delivering some type of value to the learners on their platform. That same philosophy is important to success when setting up a national education policy and ecosystem in a country.</p><h4>What will be the biggest and long-lasting impact of COVID-19 on the edtech industry?</h4><p>The education sector is certainly experiencing a significant surge in digital penetration. Although this was occurring pre-COVID-19, the pandemic has accelerated this trend, and we expect it to continue into the future. The current situation has shone a spotlight on the education sector. K-12 schools moving to blended learning environments, colleges and universities shifting to online learning, and a significant percentage of the adult population working from home or searching for upskilling or reskilling opportunities are all factors that have placed edtech in this spotlight right now. There has been significant demand for edtech across all those sectors. Our outlook for the sector today is even more bullish than when we started Owl Ventures. The caliber of entrepreneurs and talent entering the sector, the speed with which these companies are reaching significant scale or expanding internationally, and the strong capital flows coming into the sector are all happening faster than we could have predicted when we first started out. The sector has a pretty incredible trend line for the coming decades.</p><h4>What is your outlook in general for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021, and what are your specific priorities at Owl Ventures for 2021?</h4><p>We will continue to make early-growth and later-stage investments. Our focus is to invest in the world's leading edtech companies across the spectrum. We are typically the lead investor in the vast majority of the deals we do, and we join the boards of our companies. Owl Ventures takes an extremely hands-on approach to working with companies. We work with them across multiple functions, including distribution, partnerships, talent, fundraising, and outcomes measurement. Owl Ventures has created a fairly robust community of entrepreneurs within our portfolio who we invite to CEO summits and industry specific events, allowing them to share best practices and insights, as well as explore partnership opportunities. As an edtech specialist, our fund has also been able to successfully partner with leading diversified venture capital and private equity funds, including several funds in India. That has really helped accelerate the growth of Owl Ventures' portfolio companies. The coming decades will be exhilarating for the edtech sector, as some of the largest companies in the world will be created in this sector. We are incredibly excited to be at the nexus of all that activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where were your strengths and weaknesses when the pandemic first hit, and how resilient were you in managing the situation?</h4><p>The first hurdle was to quickly adjust to working fully remotely. Doing that successfully was one of the key aspects of ADNIC's resilience. Another strength was our strong financial and resources position. Human capital is a strength and we have a robust brand that customers look to more than ever in difficult periods.  Despite challenging market conditions, ADNIC delivered a resilient performance which is  driven by our strong reliability and financial strength. For ADNIC, the events of 2020 were an opportunity and that shows in the way we grew over the first half of 2020, expanding 9.1% at the top line and posting much higher growth at the bottom line. ADNIC has proved the ability to adapt to new situations, and the expertise to put the customer first and provide them platforms that function 24/7 in order to meet their requirements.</p><h4>How did you collaborate with the government and how would you rate its response?</h4><p>One of the first steps we took was to form a business continuity committee. The committee is tasked to monitor the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak on our business and ensure adherence to following government guidelines. The guidance of the government for us is a road map and we will stay on top of it. The response in the fight against Covid-19 in the UAE has been phenomenal. Abu Dhabi Government, UAE Federal Government and other entities across the emirate have implemented several initiatives and relief measures over the pandemic period to help minimize the impact.</p><h4>Did the state's COVID-19-related financial incentives impact ADNIC's operations?</h4><p>We were not directly involved in the financial incentives implemented by the Government, as they are more meant to support individuals and SMEs, offering them special re-payment restructuring of working capital facilities, lower interest rates and grace periods. However, these initiatives indirectly benefit all businesses including companies like ADNIC, because when our customers receive financial incentive it provides stability to the market and everyone benefits.</p><h4>Did the pandemic affect ADNIC on the health insurance policy side?</h4><p>The impact of the pandemic is reflected in the number, frequency, and intensity of the inflow of claims to ADNIC and other insurance companies. The effect was positive because the normal trend of people visiting doctors has changed. No one visited a doctor without having a strong reason. Additionally, the outbreak has not caused any significant delays in policies issuance and claims settlement.</p><h4>Do you believe the pandemic could have an impact on the overly crowded nature of the insurance market?</h4><p>The unhealthy competition is still ongoing except for large complex risks where pricing and underwriting is in the hands of a global reinsurer, whereby the local insurers are not in a position to set the prices and terms for such large risks. By design, the competition will be in the international market where they compete. When they compete in the international market on large risks the competition remains at acceptable levels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the effect of the pandemic on your business and what steps did you have to take to manage risk and facilitate recovery?</h4><p>Barclays quickly went into a dynamic working scenario, with 70,000 of our colleagues working remotely worldwide; thanks to our tech and infrastructure, we were able to rapidly adapt and carry on business seamlessly. We also saw that clients were suddenly much easier to reach as they weren't traveling, stuck in meetings, or out of the office, resulting in a positive increase in client engagement. In addition, given the volatility in the markets, clients were keen to see how their portfolios were performing. Our bankers and investment specialists were engaging with clients more than ever. Clients from all generations adapted to communicating via technology quickly and continue to enjoy engaging via video calls. </p><h4>What investment opportunities does the UAE offer Indian investors?€¨</h4><p>The average UHNW Indian family is spread across India and typically any combination of the UK, the UAE, and Singapore. While Barclays Private Bank operates a fully offshore platform for global Indian clients in the Middle East, we also have a domestic private bank in India servicing clients onshore. Since yields have dropped in India, we have seen Indian clients looking for leverage, which has often been executed by Middle East-underlying banks. We have also seen clients seeking real estate opportunities in the UK. </p><h4>Have you seen any major changes in investment trends and risk appetite over the last six months?</h4><p>€¨Clients have remained stable and engaged over the last six months. One of the reasons why clients in UAE choose to bank with Barclays is driven by their strong interest in the UK and/or Europe, often having homes there, looking for property, and with family members studying in those regions. We have not seen any fall in demand for UK or French real estate during this period; in fact, in some cases, demand has increased where clients feel they may be able to buy at a discount. From an investment perspective, our guidance to clients is very clear: be invested, be active, and be diversified. We always recommend being in the market. We do not believe in timing—we believe in averaging—so there is no need to wait, as none of our investment strategies are predicated on waiting for the right time. Since the outbreak of the global pandemic, we have not seen a pullback in assets and are net positive on flows for this year. We have seen an increase in demand for gold and silver, with clients wanting to build these positions. In general, clients have remained pleased and satisfied within their risk set; clients have wanted to remain invested and potentially invest more. </p><h4>To what extent are you incorporating the trend of sustainable investment in your offerings and services?€¨</h4><p>This has been a significant focus for us for a long time, led by our Head of Impact Investing based in London. From a client offering perspective, we provide access to sustainable investments through public and private markets, ranging from an ETF solution or access to a private investment. In 2019, I also had the pleasure of hosting the annual roadshow for the region for around 100 clients, where along with our investment views for 2020 we had a special focus on water and energy opportunities. In addition to ESG, conversations with many of our clients also tend to be around legacy and advisory, particularly with COVID-19 sharpening the focus on succession planning and the next generation. Sustainability frequently plays an active role in that. We also have strong philanthropy and wealth advisory practices to help clients with succession and legacy planning. The amount of inter-generational wealth transfer expected for the coming decades is significant, so our holistic offering enables us to work with our clients on the various aspects associated with this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has changed within Waha Capital since the pandemic, and what measures were taken immediately to manage risk?</h4><p>We have changed the entire company, starting with the main people on the senior team. We introduced new positions for head of corporate and head of compliance. Our strategy has changed, and our people have changed, and we have a new, young, and dynamic team now. The average age of the C-Suite or heads in the company is between 37 and 42, which reflects the health and vision of the company. We have done this without impacting the company's performance. In fact, if we compare the results from 4Q2019 and where we stand today financially, we are in a much better position and are much more resilient. The pandemic had a severe impact across all industries in different sectors and regions, and although Waha Capital was not immune, it was better prepared due to its decision to exit AerCap which released significant investment capital. We made a conscious decision to reduce our debt, which at present is extremely low compared to our equity. As for the management, we brought in a new CFO with experience in different countries like Brazil, Japan, Hong Kong, and the UK. With the new CFO's help, we were able to develop a new strategy for the company. We decided to diversify either the sectors or the regions we were present in. But we will continue to take the same approach, which is to be an active investor. That said, we need to have two types of investments: one that can generate a good multiple in three to five years and one that can generate a high cash yield or recurring income. We used to rely more on investments that would double or triple its value over a period of time. A good example is AerCap.</p><h4>How would you characterize the government's response, and what support or incentives did you receive?</h4><p>The government has been extremely serious about this from day one. It has manoeuvred and adapted to all the changes that took place during the pandemic, and it has reflected positively. This is evident from the fact that the UAE has the highest test rate and the lowest death rate. Regardless of the challenges, something that has made me feel extremely proud over the past few months is the USD20.7 billion ADNOC infrastructure deal, which is the largest global energy transaction in history. The fact that it happened during the pandemic summarizes the sheer quality of the UAE's leadership. All the numbers and actions reflect the government's adept approach. Compared to other more mature countries, the UAE managed the pandemic in an extremely efficient way.</p><h4>Have you adjusted any technology strategies or investment opportunities when it comes to technology and fintech?</h4><p>These are not new for Waha Capital. We have invested in Channel Vas, a fintech company, which is generating excellent yields for us. In certain countries, we even saw higher demand and revenue because of COVID-19. Since the management changes we made, we have outlined a new business continuity plan (BCP) as of March 2020. We have been able to complete this quickly because of the technology we possess. We fully believe that fintech and digitalization are the future, and we are setting up a robust basis for the company accordingly.</p><h4>What is your perspective of the healthcare sector? Have you seen any interesting opportunities in that area?</h4><p>We have not done any new transactions there, though we are evaluating a number of options. We already have a significant investment in Anglo Arabian Healthcare, and the healthcare sector will continue to be a focus for us in the future. Over the summer we spoke to a number of pharmaceutical companies, and they are addressing the high cost of medicine globally while sourcing and developing branded products at competitive prices. In the UAE, we are looking at our own development and forming a strategic partnership with them, probably in the US and Europe. There are a number of possibilities we are looking at. Pharma and biotech ventures will increase in the region in the next few years. If we find the right opportunity, we will jump in for sure.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the UAE and Abu Dhabi as an investment destination?</h4><p>The UAE's excellent leadership differentiates it from other regional players. Accordingly, FDI is likely to increase from a business and opportunistic perspective. The rates in the US, Europe and Japan will be nearly zero soon, which means many funds will be looking at investments elsewhere that can generate a good amount of yield. Anything more than 3-4% will be lucrative for them. Percentages like 9% or 10% will be few and far between. Current low rates in the US and Europe will mean that a country like the UAE, with its history, stability, and infrastructure, will continue to be an attractive investment destination in the future. The ADNOC deal is a good example of the appetite that exists for investors to engage here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What resilience have you seen within your organization since the pandemic started?</h4><p>We are fortunate because our aim has been to assist other companies to build up their resilience through innovative strategies, and this time we were able to put this into practice ourselves. For us, the shift came quickly, even before the effects of the initial impact. There was a degree of uncertainty initially; we were unsure about the extent of the impact the pandemic would have on our business operations. However, we discovered that our previous investments in our infrastructure, technology, and the development of our people were now paying off. We were able to resume work immediately as we had the requisite infrastructure to handle the demand. We emerged from this experience a stronger and more connected firm. We continue to be committed to the health and well-being of the communities in which we operate. One of the things we did very well was to activate a business continuity plan to safeguard our people, protect our employees' financial welfare, provide operational and service continuity, and deliver on client obligations. Our initial Crisis Management Committee established formal workstreams for every critical function, which addressed key issues and mitigation measures for potential impact areas associated with COVID-19.</p><h4>What have been the main sources of resilience at the national level?</h4><p>We have seen rapid and inspired change in Abu Dhabi over the past year. The foundation of this ethos of resilience has been government innovation and prudent policymaking, which resulted in a sound working environment, world-class infrastructure, and continuous support and investment in the education system. The government is forward-thinking in terms of creating a digital strategy for the country and continuing to invest in infrastructure. In the UAE, particularly in Abu Dhabi, there has been a tremendous amount of investment in infrastructure, technology, digitalization, government process improvement, and policy development toward human resources. The high levels of investment in infrastructure, people, and technology have sustained the economy and will be key to its growth after the pandemic.</p><h4>Has KPMG incorporated any new tactics or strategies to motivate, upskill, or reskill its employees during this pandemic?</h4><p>Absolutely. Our communications have consistently focused on the health and safety of our employees and their families. As we were not quite sure of how our people and their productivity would be impacted during the initial few weeks, we asked them to invest time in their own learning and development during the first few weeks. We have a great distance learning program that helped our people transition to being able to work productively on their client engagements. Across all our engagements, it is important that we are able to give our clients comfort around data security and confidentiality of information. I am proud that we were able to maintain trust and integrity in a remote working environment. Our advisory business has done well, and we continue to attract top talent to provide innovative solutions and transformation programs to our clients. We have worked with many government entities, particularly in Abu Dhabi. One of the interesting programs we worked on was the Go Safe Certification campaign to certify all ho-tels and service apartments in Abu Dhabi, as well as museums, libraries, malls, theme parks, and Sheikh Zayed Mosque. We were also able to constantly connect with the KPMG Global network to work with our global colleagues jointly on projects and develop innovative solutions quickly. Technology enables tapping into talent anywhere in the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see UK debt relief and humanitarian aid efforts developing in Africa as a result of the COVID-19 situation?<br></h4><p>The UK is a large donor into Africa, and what we have seen over the last few years is a much closer coordination across the UK government's various arms where we seek to get maximum impact from working collectively. In the context of COVID-19, such alignment is more essential that ever, and we are seeing that not just within the UK government's aid efforts but also across all DFIs and even into the private-sector investment community as well. In the UK, as part of the immediate response to the pandemic, we have taken a wholesale look across all of our programming work in Africa and ensure that as much of that as possible is directed to provide the help and support that the governments across Africa are in need of to help them respond to the pandemic and also to put in place the building blocks for a strong recovery. People are talking about rebuilding better and building back greener, more sustainably, and more inclusively. That is essentially the focus for us, which is making sure that every pound and penny counts to help Africa's governments and people recover from the pandemic.</p><h4>How do you see the UK-Nigeria relationship developing?€¨</h4><p>Nigeria is not the only one that is keen to boost trade, because the UK is as well. The story of Nigeria and its sheer size and scale makes it an essential partner in Africa. It is so dynamic and energetic, and the innovations we see on every street corner in Lagos are inspiring and makes you want to work together. We have had a great business relationship with Nigeria for a number of years, and not just in terms of oil and gas, although that has been a dominant feature. There has been GPB4.5 billion worth of trade between our countries year on year. Over this last year, we saw nearly a half billion worth of new business from the UK into Nigeria. We have worked hard to bring those opportunities to the UK business community. At the end of 2019, we did a Nigeria investment showcase in London, for example, with the Lord Mayor of London and packed the room with UK investors who are interested and excited to hear from Nigerians about the opportunities. We have a great relationship at the government-to-government level and across business levels. The Nigerian government has ambitions to diversify its energy mix in the next 10 years, so we see real opportunities in the renewables space as well. We have exciting deals happening around that in terms of solar energy and other areas. Agriculture is another area of growth, and we see education as an extraordinary sector as well given the size of its population and the ambition and drive of Nigerians. We have had fantastic conversations around education and skills training.</p><h4>What is your strategy to boost confidence for investors and UK companies that want to enter the market in Africa?</h4><p>€¨According to traditional investors such as Unilever and Diageo, which have operations on the ground, times are tough, as they are around the world, but everyone is committed to Africa and committed to doing the right thing in terms of helping in that response phase and being part of the recovery phase. The way that we see UK investments across Africa really plays into what the strengths will be for that recovery phase. We are seeing people coming to terms with the new reality. We are seeing and hearing from companies that are interested in the opportunities that will emerge in Africa, whether that is in terms of mergers and acquisitions, business restructuring, or companies that were previously vibrant and dynamic but are perhaps just cash strapped and looking for investment. We will see a return of some of that investment that has flooded particularly out of sub-Saharan Africa in the last few months.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its establishment in 1977, CEOE has been representing and defending the interests of Spanish businesspeople. What is the main mission of the CEOE and how do you carry it out?</h4><p>The CEOE represents the Spanish business world. It brings together more than 4,000 business associations and represents some 40 million entrepreneurs. I'd say that the CEOE is the social agent that is recognized for the negotiation of collective bargain agreements. The CEOE also presents opinions before the governments in the decision-making processes that affect private companies.</p><h4>CEOE has announced that it will choose around 15 projects to use the EU funds. What must these projects have to be selected by CEOE and approved by Brussels?</h4><p>The number of projects will range between 10 and 18. These projects must have an effect across the economy. It has to impact most of the regions, and have to be projects that meet the criteria of the European Commission. The government has to present a draft by October but the legislation that will govern the recovery fund won't be approved until January 2021. The advantage of having the draft prepared is that the European Commission will already have reviewed it before the funds' approval. EU countries have requested an advance payment equivalent to 10% of the funds that would be allocated and the expectation is to allocate EUR20 billion in recovery. The CEOE believes these funds will help reactivate the Spanish economy. The focus of these funds will be investments that will spur efficiency across the public administration. For example, this could help digitalize the public administration and reduce public spending. These investments can be also focused on human capital and PPPs. In that area, the CEOE has worked with PwC to develop 15 projects that can benefit the Spanish economy as a whole. These projects have to support SMEs, boost digitalization and ecological transition, and modernize the entire Spanish economy. These include initiatives such as the digitalization of SMEs, which can boost exports, for example. Another project is about the development of an infrastructure for electric vehicles across Spain.</p><h4>Why will this plan be different to the so-called 'Plan-E' approved in response to the 2008 recession by the Zapatero administration?  </h4><p>The government has to present a plan to the EU, and we have time to prepare the projects by the end of 2020. We have to stay away from policies that boost demand but do not generate economic growth, but public deficit.</p><h4>Remote working is a phenomenon that until now barely had an article in the Workers' Statute. Before the pandemic, only 5% of employees practiced it, whereas now more than 16% are using it. Recently, the Council of Ministers approved the law that regulates it. What are your views on this piece of legislation?</h4><p>We have negotiated this law since July, and we approve the legislation. Remote working was not regulated and it has been legislated now. However, it is true that we do not consider this to be the most urgent point to regulate. The extension of the ERTES, stability from the regulatory point of view, and the approval of state budgets, etc. are points that we consider urgent. In terms of remote working, we believe that complete isolation is not good for companies because it does not foster teamwork; therefore, it has an impact on the performance of business. Remote working will be part of the new normal, but I do not think there will be a complete shift toward remote working.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the ERTE temporary layoff mechanism? </h4><p>The government said that ERTEs cost around EUR5 billion a month, which we believe is not true. The real cost is about EUR1 billion, but for the government the ERTE temporary layoff mechanism is cheaper than the ERE, which is the traditional layoff regulation in Spain. In an ERTE, the important part of social security is paid by the employer, while in an ERE it would be paid by the state in its entirety. We are developing a mechanism to avoid corporate bankruptcies that will happen anyway. The ERTE system has been helpful in avoiding bankruptcies, but it should not be renegotiated every two or three months, as it has been the case.</p><h4>Is the CEOE having different discussions on ERTEs and assistance to the tourism sector?</h4><p>These are different topics but are part of the same strategy. Every European country has had a strategy based on three pillars. The first was to provide liquidity, which in Spain has been achieved through the ICO credit loans. The banks have been successful in providing EUR100 billion in liquidity. The second pillar was the ERTE mechanism and the third pillar is everything related to tax moratoriums or payment delays. Spain normally spends all the money it generates in buoyant times, so the consequence is that the country does not have enough resources to support the private sector during crises. As a result, other European countries have been able to provide more assistance to their respective private sectors. This is a lesson that we must learn; we should use the good times to save funds that will later help us cope with recessions.</p><h4>How will Spain's GDP be impacted in 2020?</h4><p>We developed two scenarios in a report with Deloitte. We expect the GDP to fall by 11% in the best-case scenario and 15% in the worst-case scenario. It depends if another state of emergency is declared, so we expect that any new outbreaks do not lead to new lockdown periods. The public deficit, as a result, will be in the two-digit area. The economy will struggle this year, that's for certain.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2020?</h4><p>Our priority is to continue being useful for the social discussion in order to ensure that the decisions that are made are in the benefit of society as a whole. We are willing to use all our resources to ensure that the recovery funds are well spent.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1990 by your father, how would you describe the evolution of EGA Master, and which particular milestones have marked the direction of the company?</h4><p>The evolution of our company has gone hand in hand with needs of the most important industrial users in the world. We focused on them because our sector, tool manufacturing, already started to see competition from other places such as Turkey, Mexico, and Asia in the 1990s. In order to avoid that change in which the product was becoming a commodity, we sought the area where the users of the tool not only valued the price of the product but also other characteristics. We wanted to focus on those clients that value the efficiency and safety of tools. The main industries that value these tools are aeronautics, defense, automotive, energy, oil and gas, mining and heavy industry, among others. We thus decided to focus on those areas in an attempt to offer a solution that was different. Our focus has been to transition from products that were turning into commodities into offering a comprehensive solution providing all the needs that the industries require under the umbrella of a single brand. We are able to offer tailor-made services for our clients that seek products beyond basic tools.</p><h4>Sales for EGA Master fell between 10-11% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to the previous year. How has COVID-19 impacted the company?</h4><p>Our sales fell by 10% through September. This is a tough impact, but we have managed to reduce costs. One's strategy does not have to change because of a pandemic. The strategic orientation has to remain the same, and that has been the case for EGA Master. The sales decline is a blow, but we have to take into account that the sector has experienced an up-to-20% decline in revenues on average. The most important things for us have been the people and the clients. We have an international presence, and that allowed us to anticipate what was to come. In February, we gathered hydro alcoholic gels and masks even before the state of emergency was issued. Our office workers were sent home to work remotely, but we did not do that with other jobs that required a presence in our facilities. This was a delicate and volatile situation, so our workers were concerned, and there was a high degree of uncertainty. We sought to eliminate that stress and anxiety by showing that people are our most important asset. We told our team we would not lay off employees, and we guaranteed that everyone would receive their salaries on time. We also increased our liquidity to ensure we can meet our commitments with our employees and clients. As of October, we have a positive portfolio of requested products, and we are in good shape for 2021. We are extremely optimistic and have the confidence and satisfaction of being able to meet our commitments to clients and our people.</p><h4>How has the pandemic impacted your logistics?</h4><p>The most important area for us, in Europe, is land transportation. In the international area, it is sea transportation, but an important demand from our clients is supplied through air transportation. The logistics have continued to work, though costs have increased significantly. The cargo normally travels on passenger flights, and passenger traffic has plummeted. We have not faced problems handing over our deliveries on time since we work with end customers, to whom the price does not matter that much. They are more concerned with timeliness, so they are willing to accept a more expensive cost as long as it ensures the product will be delivered on time.</p><h4>What sectors are the most important for you, and what have been the most resilient?</h4><p>One of them is the aerospace sector, because less planes are being built, and some deliveries are not even being received. Also, maintenance is being affected, because there are few planes flying. The automotive sector has also been impacted due to several factors, including the transition toward electric vehicles. The most resilient sector, in addition to mining, is oil and gas, despite the low price of oil barrels. Saudi Arabia and other countries have attempted to add value to the commodity they produce and have important ongoing oil and gas petrochemical projects. We currently export 90% of our products to more than 150 countries.</p><h4>EGA Master has offices in Dubai, France, Italy, Portugal, Peru, Mexico, and Australia. What are the company's international plans?</h4><p>At the end of the 1990s, we made the decision to focus on emerging markets because they had a greater chance of growing. In that regard, we understood that the greatest projects would be developed in those countries, as was the case. In addition, there is another factor that is extremely important, which is that the competition in emerging markets is less compared to Europe. Having a smaller competition allows us to obtain more attractive margins. We are focused on the Middle East, Asia, and Africa. We want to focus on countries that have appealing growth rates, as well as where there is a larger middle class that will require larger investments. Emerging countries also have extremely large projects in mining or oil and gas where we can participate.</p><h4>EGA Master has also received the double seal 'Calculo + Reduzco' from the ministry for its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint, the first company in the sector to do so. What is your commitment in this line? </h4><p>There are huge opportunities for renewable energies and in the hydrogen sector. The companies that can adapt to them will have a tremendous competitive advantage. This will not be an expense, but an opportunity. There are huge wind projects in offshore in South Korea, Vietnam, Europe, and the US. Also, solar energy will have a huge development, and we are looking into the needs of these industries in order to develop the tools that meet their demands. We are already working with the main companies in this regard, providing them with specific tools for work at height or anti-magnetic tools that can be used with certain engines.</p><h4>What is your key priority for 2021?</h4><p>For 2021, we want to continue being the first option for our clients by offering a comprehensive service. We want to keep being their first option to ensure their safety and efficiency. We have identified all those international big projects, and, not like our competitors, we are working to establish a direct connection with end customers. Our competitors work only with the distributors. In our case, we like to have fluid communication and direct relations with the end customer as well. This allows us to know first-hand their needs and create specific solutions for each of them. Our objective, more than a quantitative priority, is a qualitative priority.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Securing financing for the Mozambique LNG project during the COVID-19 crisis is a phenomenal achievement. What does this milestone mean for Total and Mozambique?</h4><p>It is really heartening to see that in these turbulent times the market continues to have such confidence in the project and in Total as an operator. A 5,500 strong Mozambican workforce has already delivered a lot of projects, including the airstrip, the highway between Palma and Afungi, and a number of other projects essential for the construction of the LNG facility itself.  Despite the challenges of COVID-19 we remain on track to deliver first LNG cargoes in 2024.</p><h4>What impact will this mass project have on the Cabo Delgado region?</h4><p>It is clear that the project will bring real and meaningful gains to Mozambique. These gains will last well beyond the lifetime of our Train I and II projects for the Golfinho-Atum line. Apart from injecting significant revenues into the public coffers, the project will help upskill workers and develop a professional workforce. Moreover, the project will play a vital role in the growth of companies working on the project. It will also serve as a catalyst for other industrial developments in the country. Considering the size of the resources at stake, it will effectively create a pipeline of opportunities for the Mozambican workforce as well as for local businesses. Notably, we have laid the foundations of the training center in Afungi, and have also started providing training using existing facilities in Pemba as well as online capabilities. During the  operations phase, we expect to employ 1,500 Mozambicans. Total and its partners are working on a dedicated training center to support the operation phase, which will require a skilled workforce. In terms of improving access to local businesses, we have two areas of focus: ensuring transparency and publishing information about the call for tender and employment opportunities. We also have various capacity building programs at all levels. We believe it is important for local companies to access funding at an attractive cost, which is why are engaging with banks and multilateral agencies. We are on track and there is clearly a catalyst role for the Mozambican LNG project to play in Mozambique. To date, we have invested USD699 million, proving that we are here to deliver in partnership with local businesses. We have a strong engagement with INP on a monthly basis to show the progress we are doing with regard to local content matters.</p><h4>What are your final thoughts on the current situation in Mozambique?</h4><p>Total is the world's second-largest global LNG player and we have been present throughout the African continent for many years. Our entry into Mozambique and the Rovuma Basin is a very strategic play for us because Mozambique's geographic location will allow us to serve all the emerging LNG markets in the world. Investing in LNG is one of Total's major focuses because it generates low carbon emissions. The world is shifting away from coal and embracing LNG, which will experience strong growth over the next 20 years. A quick look at Total's portfolio reflects this switch. In 2004, our hydrocarbon portfolio was 34% of gas and 66% oil, and today it is 53% gas and 47% oil. This trend will continue as consumers around the world become more mindful of the type of fuel they use and the way they harm the environment. At Total we have the challenge of climate change integrated within our own corporate strategy and we are aware of our responsibility to the planet. There is no doubt that the LNG project in Mozambique is a significant piece of this ambition. We  are convinced that this project will bring real and meaningful gains to Mozambique and to the province of Cabo Delgado. We are talking about the kind of gains that will outlive the Golfinho-Atum project, both in the shape of revenues, knowledge transfer, and growth of local businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your growth strategy for the next few years, and what challenges are you expecting to face? <br></strong>In 2020, we are planning to expand from two outlets to four or five. That was supposed to happen in 2019, but we couldn't achieve it as we required investment in infrastructure for the business itself. In 2021, we are planning to expand beyond Oman. The plan is to penetrate India, for example, given the huge population and demand for dates. Historically, there is also a long tradition of exporting dates to India and importing spices to Oman. The booming middle class in India is another factor why we are targeting the sub-continent. Expansion in India, Malaysia, or Indonesia is feasible because of large local populations and lack of supply. Meanwhile, our product range stretches to date molasses, vinegar, soap, halwa, and chocolate products. </p><p><strong>How do you research new tastes and trends that potential consumers are looking for?<br></strong>We always get feedback from customers at our two points of sale in Muscat Opera Gallery and Muscat City Center. We also gather the opinions of our employees, who are trained to always ask customers about their perspectives and expectations.</p><p><strong>How do you expect Oman's luxury goods sector to develop over the coming years, and how will these events impact the food segment?</strong><br>At Opera Gallery, we have a mixture of Omanis, expatriates, and tourists. Globally, luxury brands are always booming because quality is always a guarantee. The location also helps a lot in the luxury segment. We plan to expand because we believe there is a huge demand for good quality. I would argue that our prices are also reasonable, as we focus mostly on quality. In 2016, when the economy dipped, the date industry suffered badly as corporates stopped buying. Usually they buy in Ramadan or Eid, but in 2016 this practice came to a halt. However, top-quality and luxury products continue to be sold regardless of the phase of the economic cycle. In 2017, business started booming again, and it only got better in 2018 and 2019. We hope 2020 will also end on a positive note.</p><p><strong>What locations appeal to the luxury food segment when considering future openings?<br></strong>In the future, we are planning to open in Salalah, as a new mall will open there. We will also be present in Muscat duty free and in Nizwa, since there is a good location close to the Nizwa Fort. These are all premium locations and compatible with the luxury segment. We also deal with five-star hotels such as Al Bustan Hotel, Crowne, Intercontinental, and Kempinski. The majority of five-star hotels buy from us because 90% of our dates are Khalas, the finest in Oman. Moreover, Oman Air now offers them to their business-class and first-class passengers.</p><p><strong>How important will e-commerce become for the luxury industry?<br></strong>We are now in the process of developing our website so you will be able to order through it either from Oman or outside of Oman. We plan to send products abroad and we have learnt that Europe may become a great market for us in this regard; therefore, e-commerce is of paramount importance for the success of our growth strategy.</p><p><strong>How does the luxury industry deal with the balance between innovation and tradition?<br></strong>We always try to mix both innovation and tradition. In our workshop, we try to be more traditional in the way we produce our products. Regarding innovation, for example, we apply it to new products that we elaborate in a traditional way. Regarding innovation, for example, we use halwa instead of sugar. The innovation comes also in the form of different flavors. For example, we combine rose water with a date paste to be more creative. The key is to offer new innovative flavors and products while respecting the traditions and cultural heritage of Oman. Maintaining top quality is a key toward success. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[best-kept-secret]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your growth strategy for 2020?<br></strong>In 2020, we are implementing our new strategy to reinvent the way we create, communicate, and distribute products. To be successful in luxury fragrances, which is one of the most competitive industries, you need to excel across two pillars: creating extraordinary products and experiences as well as expanding reach and maximizing sales. In the short and medium term, we will leverage our portfolio of successful, iconic fragrances and complement those by launching an interesting new set of products inspired by Oman, but with global relevance and marketability. Importantly, we will maximize the potential throughout the world by creating experiences beyond the pure product, and this relies on two different aspects. First, we need to enhance the experience offered at our physical facilities, whether at our unique visitor center, where we welcome around 15,000 fragrance lovers annually, or at our retail stores. Second, we need to focus more on digital and social media, which is rather new to the brand, because it represents a huge growth potential for us. At present, in the beauty business, about two thirds of purchase decisions are influenced by Instagram, which means that it is vital for us to have the right content on all digital platforms. At the core of our future forward interaction with our consumers is the “Creative Collective." It is a team of established names and emerging figures who will be the voice of the brand across multiple touchpoints including product, digital, and in-store.</p><p><strong>What are the main trends impacting the industry in Oman? <br></strong>In Oman, we are a key player. We closed 2019 with double-digit growth. Starting from our global visitor center in Muscat, we were able to convey a more compelling brand story to a broader consumer base. It was a matter of going beyond the product transaction to really immerse consumers in the brand and establish a stronger connection with them. Indeed, this was a key driver behind the company's success in 2019 and will remain so going forward. We need to transcend the experience of the center to our boutiques in Muscat, Sohar, Nizwa, and beyond, including a more compelling digital experience.</p><p><strong>How is your e-commerce strategy evolving?<br></strong>At Amouage, our consumer-centric focus will come to life through a seamless integration of online and offline channels. We know that many consumers prefer an online browsing experience that goes beyond a pure product catalog, infused with some experiential aspects. For the physical experience, the last mile is critical; whether our consumers experience a product at our boutique or get it delivered to their doorstep, it is ultimately all about creating extraordinary experiences. Our e-commerce strategy come alive with amouage.com, which will feature intuitive navigation, inspiring content, easy shopping functions, and state-of-the-art integration of social media platforms. Subsequently, we will elevate the brand experience at brick-and-click stores as well as specialty marketplaces. Our goal is to provide the best experience and reliable product delivery across all key markets within the next 18 months.</p><p><strong>What is your branding strategy?<br></strong>Over the past decades, Amouage has garnered a global reputation for bringing true artistry to its creations and has become an icon in the fragrance world. The brand character is daring, and our fragrances are for people who want to amplify their personalities. Arresting and alluring, our products appeal to sophisticated, confident, and well-travelled consumers who want something truly unique and extraordinary. Our relationship with consumers is personal. We are focused on fueling this one-to-one relationship spanning from high-touch human interaction at the store to fully leveraging the potential of digital and social channels. We know consumers love Amouage products because they allow them to express their personality. Fragrances in the ultra-luxury segment are personal and intimate. So, for the majority of our consumers, Amouage is their personal fragrance, their personal secret. We plan to continue being the best-known secret within the industry. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for Oman Sail in 2019?<br></strong>2019 was a phenomenal year, both on and off the water. On the sailing front, our athletes were crowned Asian champions, while the youth team won a bronze and a silver medal at the Arab and Asian championships. Our main focus remains looking after the sailors, to ensure they have the necessary coaching and support to compete at the international level. In addition, our youth sailing department is now fully Omanized, which is a major milestone. Off the water, our main drive has been organizing sports tourism and sports events. We believe that sports tourism can have a major positive impact on the economy and society.</p><p><strong>How would you assess the impact of sport tourism on the overall socio-economic texture of the country?<br></strong>Going forward, sports tourism can have a major positive impact under an economic, social and societal point of view, taking a more prominent place in society in the next couple of years. Since participants, spectators, and investors are already out there, the support of the media sector could really add up to the already visible societal impact. Indeed, these elements craft a national profile that will, on the one hand, attract FDI, and, on the other, increase savings by promoting an active lifestyle, which will counter the rise in non-communicable diseases, a real issue in the Sultanate over the last three years.</p><p><strong>How do you think sports activities can become sustainable in the long run?<br></strong>Sports tourism is a robust sector that is resilient through economic downturns. If Oman can select the right sports and engage a sufficient number of people to work together within a framework of sustainability, we can create a positive impact on a mass scale. Many countries are using the sector as an economic stimulus. In New Zealand, sports and adventure tourism contributes as much as the oil and gas sector in Oman, giving an indication of the scale of value and potential the sector can provide. Oman's sport selection criteria determine a number of sustainable factors such as working to achieve a flow of inbound tourists and putting frameworks to utilize and showcase the country's tourism offerings without having to spend significantly on infrastructure. In addition, the strategy is to organize events effectively and efficiently while ensuring that they generate profit within four years. A key sustainability element that is taken into great consideration is ensuring that the spectacular natural landscapes of the country aren't impacted.</p><p><strong>How are you seeking to achieve economic sustainability and engage with the broader community?<br></strong>Economic sustainability comes when the income from an event is higher than the cost. For example, Al Mouj Muscat Marathon 2020, which featured 10,000 runners from 102 countries, reached a break-even point. Upward growth opportunities can be generated through local and international participation and through funding from sponsors and partners. At a corporate level, we have a successful initiative with SOHAR Port to encourage kids from the communities where they operate to take on the challenge. After years of organizing the event, the culture of running is being adopted as an integral part of healthy living, which, in the long term, will lessen the burden on the national health system.</p><p><strong>How would you assess the engagement of youth, and how will that determine the future of sports in Oman?<br></strong>Youth are more independently taking the decision to engage in sports, and we are seeing a coordinated effort by various ministries and stakeholders. In 20 years, the sport ecosystem in Oman will be driven by the education sector. Indeed, the initiatives being run through the schools are proving to be really popular and the schools themselves are very receptive. There is plenty of compelling research showing that kids who intake more oxygen perform better. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the key characteristics of the Omani market that have been incorporated into the hotel?<br></strong>Oman is a beautiful country with a strong emerging tourism market. The Sultanate's outdoor adventure offerings, rich heritage, and hospitable culture felt like a natural fit for W's unique take on life, luxury, and travel. Moreover, the Sultanate's geographical location suits us; it is only a seven-hour flight from continental Europe and Asia. As a hotel that seeks to fuel a lust for life, W Muscat further fitted the local market by bringing a bold and original element to luxury hotels in the Sultanate, attracting a diverse and vibrant clientele base. We follow a lifestyle philosophy—centered around fashion, design, music, and food—that we find reverberates with many aspects of the fun-loving local culture. Omani culture has been a reference point for us at every stage of the journey. The architectural components and W Muscat's entire design narrative are based on Oman's history and draw inspiration from the country's natural beauty, historical significance, and strong social culture. That's evident from the 9-ton frankincense tree in our entryway, star-lit ceilings, and mashrabiya patterns throughout. Our B&amp;F menus are developed by teams who look to local produce and cuisine for inspiration. And our location on the coastline of Shatti Al Qurum's turquoise waters continues to inspire our day-to-day activities, such as sunrise yoga and freshly grilled lobster lunches. We ultimately aim to provide a luxury hotel experience that complements Oman's incredible surroundings.</p><p><strong>What key elements should the government and private sector work on to give the tourism industry an extra push?<br></strong>Oman's natural landscape and beautiful locations are unparalleled around the world, and provide a completely unique angle for the country to leverage. The picturesque coastline and abundant marine are also hard to beat and one of Oman's greatest gifts to guests. These are areas where the tourism industry can find immense opportunities. The government's investment in adventure and sports tourism is a perfect example of this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has digital transformation enhanced your company's productivity?<br></strong>Management information systems and digital planning are becoming crucial for us. We have an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that is a state-of-the-art quality management, namely SAP. It helps unify our entire information bank as well as the flow of information from planning to procurement, ingredients, packaging, products, and all the raw materials. It also links our sales and marketing, which helps us come up with manufacturing to see the optimum quantity and quality that goes into manufacturing and production.</p><p><strong>Looking to the next three to five years, how do you see these market requirements evolving?<br></strong>The dynamic of the market has two main elements: the needs and requirements of the end users. The lifestyle in Oman has changed, also changing the entire concept of the needs and requirements of end users with it. As a manufacturer, we have to adapt with our entire value chain system to the end users' needs and requirements. This requires an understanding of modern trade, where they come from, where they come in, and the power of negotiations.</p><p><strong>What does it mean for the pricing strategy?<br></strong>The power of the negotiation was once in the hands of manufacturers; however, today it is in the hands of large, chain supermarkets. Before getting into the pricing structure, first, one has to register the product and then make it available on the shelves that the company has rented. If a product is slow moving, then it obstructs other products from the shelves. This means it needs a more exposed location, though then the fees will increase. We have to remember that we are not alone in the market, and other similar products are also available.</p><p><strong>How do changes in customer needs and increasing manufacturing costs reflect on your strategy?<br></strong>That is the challenge. At the end of the day, we want our product on the shelves at a cost-effective, competitive, and affordable price. The game is to increase the entire value chain efficiency, whereby the cost of production has to fall, and the capacity of factory utilization should be at economy of scale. The more one produces, the lower the cost of production, the greater the power of negotiation they will have with their supplier, and the more cost effective it will be for their products to be on shelves.</p><p><strong>How would you evaluate the government's efforts to modernize the logistics sector? <br></strong>The logistics sector plays a crucial role, particularly for the products we export to foreign markets. The strategic location of the Sultanate of Oman facilitated our exports and enabled us to expand our units, since we are within 1,800km of these markets. This logistical advantage helped us to increase our export volumes, as we are able to also import materials, produce them there, and reexport them to the West and the MENA region.</p><p><strong>How can the national logistic strategy be improved in terms of customs and regulatory issues? <br></strong>There is a synergy between the public and private sectors, with the government helping the industrial sector by attracting FDI and increasing employment opportunities. This synergy is crucial, since it serves the country's economic growth, as well as encourages companies to enter new markets and develop new products. We also have more than 75 companies that support our products around Kenya and have had success in the East African region, where we have exported many of our products. This is why expanding in Africa is beneficial, so our next step is Central Africa. In turn, the coordination between the private and public sector is growing, and it is beneficial for both parties.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020, and how do they incorporate innovation?<br></strong>We seek to identify the activity per unit to define each individual's goals and overall activity to increase productivity and effectiveness. We are also using more sophisticated tools to eliminate defects in production lines. Hence, our priorities for 2020 are three important elements: efficiency, effectiveness, and productivity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you walk us through your growth strategy for the medium term?<br></strong>Currently, we are producing around 2.4 MTPA steel through use of our own DRI, which is around 200,000 MT per month of steel produced, which is sold in the local market and primarily in the GCC. Our product composition is square billets, round billets, and rebar. 32% of the steel product is sold locally in Oman, while the remaining 68% is exported to various countries in GCC, Europe, and Far East. In rebar, we are market leader in Oman and also a leader in the export of rebar to the UAE. Round and rebar are our premium products and encompass 82% of our product portfolio, all of which is either sold locally or in the GCC. In this context, our medium-term growth strategy is becoming self-reliant in the bulk raw material required for producing steel and increasing market penetration and market share in the GCC, US, Southeast Asia, China, and Europe.</p><p><strong>What technological upgrades can enhance the iron and steel manufacturing supply chain process in Oman?<br></strong>The key is to focus on backward integration, asset sweating, and optimal utilization of available resources. To increase throughput dollar per minute, we have undertaken two investments to increase our SMS capacity from 2 MTPA to 2.4 MTPA by debottlenecking constraint up the value chain by adding a 2nd caster to our steel plant.  On the upstream side, we have upgraded our DRI capacity from 1.5 MTPA to 1.8 MTPA. This backward enhancement brings down our cost and reduces our dependence on the purchase of metallics from the market. Going further, we have plans to transform JSIS Oman into a fully backward-integrated plant with upcoming investment in a lime and dolo calcination plant and prospective additional capacities in the form of a DRI and pellet plant. Moreover, we are improving maintenance practices through the use of automated tools, business excellence techniques, TPM, lean practices, better housekeeping of assets, TOC, data analytics, the systemic integration of SAP with automation systems, and more. We have enhanced our capacity utilization at various plants from 5-10% on a YoY basis. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does MTS play in Oman's market and what is your medium-term growth strategy?<br></strong>Majees Technical Services started purely as a trading organization and then moved onto services and eventually into manufacturing, mostly geared toward the oil and gas industry, targeting the Middle East, North Africa, and Southeast Asia. We continued the traditional lines of business and added newer lines under our new focus on manufacturing. We are looking to bring in skillsets that are not present in Oman. At present, we produce flare packages in Oman, but we want to take this to the next level and produce more process packages. On the digital transformation aspect, we already provide cybersecurity solutions for a number of banks. Internally, we are exploring robotic process automation. In this sense, our priorities for 2020 can be summarized as increasing the local content in our teams, exporting more, and implementing more digital strategies.</p><p><strong>Are these avenues for growth a reactionary approach to how the market has evolved?<br></strong>In the last few years, the market has moved toward the localization of services and manufacturing. There is a policy that Omani-made products must be given a 10% price preference, especially in engineering services and equipment. On the employment side, local companies are under tremendous stress because of Omanization. On the digital transformation side, although we are one of the leading telecoms and security providers in Oman, PDO is leading the charge because it established digital transformation as a unit within the company, setting new rules of engagement and pulling in companies like us who are service providers. This might lead to the development of some models that are relevant for all players.</p><p><strong>How will Oman strike a balance between the government trying to engage SMEs and big established players?<br></strong>In the last few years, a handful of companies that were once SMEs have grown, and there is currently a lack of SMEs. Young companies will grow to fill that vacuum, while the larger companies will no longer compete on smaller projects due to high costs. The marketplace will adjust itself. The bigger companies might suffer, or they might even grow their prospects and revenues. Nonetheless, there is space for new players to come in.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the relationship between local players and foreign players to evolve?<br></strong>The new foreign capital investment law will possibly allow foreign investors to hold up to 100% ownership. We welcome competition, though at the same time we have to be careful about foreign manufacturers if we want to develop a manufacturing industry in Oman. Foreign investors will be more confident in deploying capital, and the practice of having silent shareholding will also stop, which means serious Omani businesspeople will probably start investing more. Previously, Omani businesspeople were investing because the law required them to be a 30% shareholder. More active engagement between all shareholders is good for the entire economy.</p><p><strong>What is the key for filling the skills gap in the market in a sustainable way?<br></strong>It has been a challenge because we can no longer hire foreign engineers, and there are not many engineers in the local market. The private sector has to be profitable at the end of the day, which means we need to find competent people with the right skills and work ethics. We are training fresh Omani graduates and helping them assume junior management and mid-management roles in the future. We need to continue to improve the workplace and grow our presence on social media so that we can better attract young Omanis.</p><p><strong>Where will technology have the greatest impact within your industry, and what is your definition of innovation?<br></strong>The deepest impact will be on how we market ourselves. The market is still dependent largely on local clients, but that is changing. As a business, you also want to innovate in terms of new products. For us, innovation is using the latest technology to improve your processes and increase profitability. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give an overview of IIC's role in Oman and its areas of focus?<br></strong>IIC was established in 2017 under the Tanfeedh program and mandated to focus on industrial innovation. The primary objective is for IIC to become an enabler for industry to contribute towards economic diversification. We run four specialized programs: the first with the goal of developing human capital in industrial innovation; the second to establish innovative industrial start-ups; the third to support innovation within existing companies; and the fourth to apply the power of innovation to transform one industrial sector every year. All these programs function within a powerful innovation ecosystem which is constantly evolving, so that Oman will witness new generation of innovative entrepreneurs, knowledge-driven SMEs, endorsement of innovation by existing industries, and more competitive and innovative sectors. Innovation is imperative for any nation to progress; therefore, understanding, concepts, and terminologies associated with innovation are important so that innovation can be developed and commercialized to have social, economic, and political impacts.</p><p><strong>How do you support the commercialization of innovation, especially those from applied research?<br></strong>One of our primary services is to support commercialization, which is an extremely important complementary process to bring innovation to the market. We see a great deal of innovations claimed nationally and globally, but they have never reached commercialization and thus will never reach the market. For this reason, we qualify industrial innovation specialists through intensive training so that they understand how to commercialize their innovative projects and capitalize on tools like market intelligence, big data, e-marketing, and market share on a global level. For example, to support sector innovation in F&amp;B, we had to study market trends and perceptions around the world, then we gathered information from Asia, the Gulf, Europe, and Africa, and eventually finalized the potential hundreds of products that can be advantageous to Oman. We developed our own methodology and procedures to support commercialization starting from assessing the readiness of the product to be launched, the business model to follow, and the targeted market.</p><p><strong>Can you highlight IIC partnerships and collaborations?<br></strong>Partnership is a crucial factor when talking about technology transfer and innovation. For innovation to have an impact, there is a need to network with experts and innovation agencies as one ecosystem. We have already listed all potential opportunities that came from the different sectors, especially those that are product and technology oriented to be commercialized. In addition, we are in close collaboration with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, the Ministry of Manpower, Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Al Raffd Fund, and Riyada to support entrepreneurs in commercializing these opportunities.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between entrepreneurship and innovation, and how should that be reflected in Oman's economy?<br></strong>There is a difference between entrepreneurship and innovation. When entrepreneurship is triggered and driven by innovation, it is by far more powerful and competitive. The flash of traditional entrepreneurship that took place in Oman over the last few years resulted in vastly similar SMEs, such as restaurants, transportation, crafts, and beauty salons, some of which ended up in negative competition and failed, which made other entrepreneurs reluctant to pursue in business; however, when it comes to innovation, entrepreneurs are inspired by the competitive advantages and thus, their spirits are high to jump on board, and for that we already seeing extremely promising innovative projects and SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the main pillars of Khazaen Economic City, and what is the strategy is moving forward in the long and short term?<br></strong>Khazaen Economic City is the most recent integrated economic city being developed over 52 million sqm in the heart of Oman. Khazaen is the closest economic city to Muscat and is surrounded by a high-density population area, with a focus on light and medium industries. It is the first fully PPP project awarded to the private sector through a process of proposal submissions. The area is being developed with a commercial approach. In 2019, we laid down the city's foundation, and we also awarded the first contract for the first phase of infrastructure, which will open around 3 million sqm of leasable area and will include Oman's first dry port measuring around 250,000sqm. Our focus is to initiate and structure business opportunities and investment products to be offered to interested investors and business owners. Another key project which we have initiated is the food cluster. Khazaen will accommodate a well-designed food cluster project. A state-of-the-art facility designed to cover an area of almost 1 million sqm, the food cluster will enhance the value chain of Oman's food industry. The first phase will include a central fruits and vegetables market that will be the source of fresh produce and a platform for wholesale trade, and the second phase will include related industries such as food processing, packaging, canning, and preservations. Khazaen is also targeting international companies that operate across the food industry value chain besides local and global investors to establish their businesses at the city and use Oman as a hub for processing and distributing to the region and globally while benefiting from the well-established logistics gateways across the country, Khazaen's strategic location, and the attractive commercial and long-lease terms. The industrial and logistics components occupy around 60% of the total area. One of our key drivers is that the concentration of facilities and assets here allows businesses to lower their operational costs and be more efficient. We can have staff accommodation, warehousing, manufacturing, offices, and so on all located here.</p><p><strong>What profile of investors do you want to attract, and how does the city fit into the overall industrial competitiveness of the country?</strong><br>We have many business cities, parks, and infrastructures that complement one another. Any business that wants to have access to a large population center, different transportation options, or be close to Muscat is who we are perfect for. We are also focused on our offerings and only host light and medium projects. We have no intention of attracting heavy industries. Khazaen's location also gives it a great deal of competitive advantages especially for projects related to logistics and warehousing. Our proximity to all the key logistics gateways in the country like Muscat Airport (35 minutes), Suwaiq Port (30 minutes), and Sohar Port (2 hours) gives investors various options for its transportation and export. Our proximity to Muscat also allows the government to easily offer certain anchor projects they would like to have close by but not in the major population centers. Our focus is on attracting more international businesses and drawing more FDI into the country. Our interest is to bring business opportunities to Oman and serve as an expansion hub.</p><p><strong>What prospects are there to make Khazaen into a smart city?<br></strong>Our focus now is to develop an infrastructure that can accommodate any smart solution in the future. Our implementation of these solutions will be done in stages as the city and businesses' needs grow. We already talked to different international technology companies so as to be ready for these concepts. Earlier in 2020, we signed with Oman Broadband Company, which will invest in the fiber-optic infrastructure. Part of our agreement is also to explore the different modes of smart solutions that could be implemented in the city. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[bringing-it-all-together]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do the major highlights of the past few years reflect the strategic path Madayn is undertaking within the broader Oman industrial development plan?</strong><br>The brand identity change to Madayn (“cities" in Arabic) in 2018, was the result of a major strategic change made in 2008 and its fulfilment, wherein we had decided to follow a live-work-play model for subsequent developments, building adequate social infrastructure around all our business agglomerations. In other words, we declared that we would build little business cities with inter-dependent economic activities—not just manufacturing. This unleashed many investment opportunities in the built environment, such as housing, shopping, education, recreation, facilities management, and so on. We also made PPPs part and parcel of this strategy. With the setting up of our own investment arm—Shumookh Investment and Services in 2010 and most recently Oman Investment and Development Holding Company (Mubadrah)—we have created a new generation of related companies engaged in anything from facility management and smart metering to renewable energy. Al Rusayl Industrial City is now a private company that is free to pursue its own strategies for further growth and development. We are set to privatize certain other industrial cities as well. The masterplan for the development of these industrial cities is done holistically to ensure top-class integrated urban infrastructure that supports a community.</p><p><strong>How do you expect demand from investors to evolve in the medium term, and what further incentives, packages, and infrastructural developments will you attract them with?</strong><br>Every year, we receive around 100 new tenant firms, and we expect this trend to continue over the coming years. For this to occur, we need to understand what investors require and capitalize on our business model to meet those demands. In this sense, as a result of the Royal Decree No. 32/2015, Madayn became more autonomous to match the speed required to facilitate setting up new industrial projects, and more so in attracting foreign investments. This decree empowers Madayn to offer sector-specific and cluster-specific incentives and benefits as needed. Madayn has established a one-stop shop facility called Masar Service Centre in Al Rusayl and Sohar to provide all government services, including issue of licenses, approvals, visas, and activity registration. Madayn can also attract local and international developers to develop, establish, and operate some of the new industrial cities, expand existing cities, and offer other value-added services to meet the needs and requirements of new investors. The newly announced Foreign Investment Law will augment the flow of FDIs into the country, and Madayn has to be ready to provide smart facilitation to such investors.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020 and the main drivers behind them?<br></strong>Madayn is focused on enhancing the quantity and quality of Omanization in the manufacturing sector and has already taken steps to augment the employability of job seekers through the Training for Employment program. For the long term, we have set up Madayn Industrial Academy to offer this on a continuous basis through internationally accredited vocational certification. The effort will be successful only if we also sustain existing businesses and rapidly create new ones. Therefore, Madayn has to transform itself into an organization where setting up and running business is absolutely hassle-free. Our systems must be reengineered, and our own staff need to be retrained to be pro-business and proactive. At the same time, we need to engage with other government bodies like the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs, Immigration, and so on, to ensure a unity of direction in facilitating investments and investors.</p><p><strong>What is the role of Industry 4.0 in Madayn's vision for the future?<br></strong>The industrial sector and academia are aware of the need to adopt Industry 4.0. The new industrial strategy formulated by Ministry of Commerce and Industry under the guidance of UNIDO articulates similar strategies. Shumookh already has a subsidiary company poised to concentrate on IoT. But we would like to have the manufacturing sector adopt IoTs and other means of automation to enhance productivity. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for the MICE sector in 2019, and what should the market expect in 2020?<br></strong>2019 saw the creation of OCEC as one scalable structure hosting employees and operations from AEG Ogden and Oman International Exhibition Center. We worked in strong collaboration with OMRAN and the Ministry of Tourism, bringing many international events to the Sultanate, welcoming international associations, government delegations, private-sector events, and over 50 embassies. 2019 was also a milestone year for OCEC with the opening of the Madinat Al Irfan Theatre, which marked the completion of the entire OCEC precinct. In 2020, we will continue to drive our efforts in strengthening OCEC's global position as a leading events and business tourism destination. We will also improve our industry relationships with international associations to develop business, attract new events, and expand Oman's business events offerings. Our new multipurpose Madinat Al Irfan Theatre venue has proved to be a key asset in our strategy. The venue boasts state-of-the-art technology as well as fully customizable options. It has the capacity to host live shows, international congresses, graduations, and large-scale corporate events. Throughout 2020, we expect to receive 11 international conferences and secure more events for the following years.</p><p><strong>What is required on a national level to exploit the potential of the MICE industry?<br></strong>The MICE industry is one of the fastest growing markets in the global tourism industry. This is a particularly important opportunity for OCEC and for tourism in Oman to leverage. The MICE industry has phenomenal potential for economic contribution and for generating millions in indirect spending. With a world-class events venue, and the priceless addition of Oman's landscape and welcoming culture, the Sultanate is in a unique position to offer the world a valuable and coveted MICE destination. It is important to partner with other industry stakeholders, such as airlines, hotels, and ministries, to develop an integrated, united approach for the tourism sector. It's also important to collaborate and build cross-sector capacities.</p><p><strong>How does Oman balance showcasing its traditional culture and being innovative when it comes to technology and MICE events?</strong><br>Oman's rich heritage and welcoming culture are key components of our business development. We are a peaceful nation with religious and political stability, and an absolutely breathtaking landscape—all of which add great value to Oman as a tourism destination, whether for business or leisure. These components are part and parcel of OCEC's offerings and are woven into our operational culture and our services at all times. Oman's culture and tradition complement OCEC's operations. We are a nation of family gatherings and warm hospitality and our venue approaches innovation and technology with that in mind. With state-of-the-art AV technology and a future-proof venue ready to advance, our services constantly seek to provide more personal and authentic experiences for guests while showcasing our beautiful country. We also collaborate with local SMEs on technological and innovative projects, such as digitalization, data generation through racking systems, heat maps, ticketing platforms, and interactive applications.</p><p><strong>What major trends are shaping the MICE industry?<br></strong>The global events industry is becoming more tech-centric and innovative; therefore, it is essential to provide a technologically advanced venue with innovative solutions. At OCEC, we are always digitalizing processes to provide faster, more efficient services and to more thoroughly monitor quality control. Our website provides a 360-degree virtual tour of the entire venue and 3D maps of the rooms, allowing international clients to fully experience the venue ahead of time. There is also an increasing demand for customization in events, specifically in customization of the actual event experience. For example, event organizers may look to use VR or AR tools to provide attendees with a more immersive experience. As a future-proof venue, OCEC has the ability to provide a customizable space and seamlessly adopt new technologies. We continue to add services that offer more opportunities for customization and authentic event experiences. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you expect the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil price environment to impact the Omani supply chain in the medium term?<br></strong>The COVID-19 outbreak has changed both the businesses environment and social lifestyles all over the world. Globalization has received a reality check, with forced lockdown halting supply chains and logistics facilities. A great deal of outsourcing will need to be relooked at, especially when it comes to physical items, such as medical devices. The government has to view medical security the same way it has long-viewed food security. Fortunately, the government has realized how vulnerable it allowed Oman to become as a result of its dependency on imported items, especially in the medical industry, which has been put under enormous pressure. Thanks to technology, people can continue to work, and organizations can continue to function. There has been a rise in the adoption of cloud-based solutions, and local solutions, such as Igtimaati, will capture more market because of security and confidentiality issues. Companies providing technological solutions will witness revenue growth in the long run, since the post-COVID-19 reality will still bear the changes brought on by the pandemic.</p><p><strong>What role can technology and digitalization play in supporting the business environment?<br></strong>As highlighted by the establishment of the Technological Innovation Committee, technology has become the main asset for governments and businesses to counter the pandemic. This committee will supervise all IT initiatives directed to counter the epidemic and identify priorities and requirements to ensure diversity of initiatives and avoid repetition. It will also organize and direct specialized national capabilities to provide innovative IT solutions to curb the spread of COVID-19. In order to support Omani businesses, OTF allocated USD2.6 million to fund start-ups and deal with the day-to-day problems faced by Omanis. The idea is to invest in long-lasting solutions to fight chronic diseases and pandemics. There are a number of successful examples. Mandoob and Wareed are delivering medicines to prevent the elderly from leaving their homes. WAKAN tech, in cooperation with the Muscat Municipality, is using its drones to spray disinfectants. Drewel is cooperating with the Omani Farmers Association to enable farmers to sell their agricultural products. E-Mushrif and Scouting Wasp have developed a remote thermal examination system to scan faces and test body temperatures. In education, Ashal is helping students acquire scientific and practical knowledge and develop their skills remotely. Finally, Bahar Plus moved the wholesale fish market online in less than 10 days, going from zero revenues to USD25,000-50,000 in daily transactions.</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through OTF's investment strategy in the medium term?<br></strong>Based on a Magnitt report published in Q12020, Oman climbed to fourth place in terms of the number of deals. OTF has invested in 108 start-ups in the US, South Africa, and GCC countries. It aims to achieve sustainable economic growth by investing directly in local companies; facilitating the entry of foreign companies in the Omani market; and transferring and localizing modern technologies that will help Oman move toward a digital society. Our priorities in 2020 are targeting four Omani start-ups and scaling outside Oman through acquisitions. OTF seeks to support Vision 2040 and focus on investments in five core sectors: tourism, logistics, manufacturing, fishing, and mining.</p><p><strong>What challenges do young companies and start-ups in Oman face?<br></strong>SMEs are disproportionately affected by market failures and barriers and inefficiencies in the business environment and policy sphere. Their contribution also depends on access to strategic resources, such as skills, knowledge networks, and finance, and on public investments in areas such as education and training, innovation, and infrastructure. In Oman, the most prominent challenge is obtaining a payment gateway because it requires a lot of effort and time. Banks also have difficulties extending loans to SMEs. Finally, the commercial law needs to be updated to recognize different classes of shares that are central to a tech start-up's ability to attract and recruit talent. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the driver behind the establishment of Cloud Acropolis in Oman, and what role does it seek to play in the Sultanate's digital transformation, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak?<br></strong>There are 60 submarine cables coming into Oman, and setting up a data center would be the perfect way to meet the country's white spaces and gain a competitive advantage. There was no international company playing the role of a pure cloud provider, and the ecosystem was in need of innovation to drive down prices to a competitive level. Moreover, we noticed receptiveness on the part of the Omani consumer market to the adoption of ICT services, with rapid growth of the online transaction market. Finally, we saw the availability of human resources, with an extremely high percentage of new graduates with an IT background, a testament to the country's inclination toward the industry. As a result of COVID-19, all businesses started looking at e-commerce, digital communication tools, and open source. We will see steady advancements in IoT, AI, and ERP systems, and we seek to become the underlying enabler behind the digital transformation of the Sultanate. </p><p><strong>Why should companies outsource their IT services?<br></strong>The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted once again the importance of business continuity. As a cloud system provider, Cloud Acropolis has been able to work from anywhere, and we have been able to do so as a result of the investments in disaster recovery systems, online and offline backup, and ERP programs. Normal enterprises, however, cannot build the same type of infrastructure and should outsource their services to professional companies. Moreover, while cybersecurity concerns around outsourcing persist, hardware downtimes are much more frequent than on virtually shared platforms. Companies cannot be sure their data is 100% secured, but enterprises need to look at it from an internal maturity and processes point of view. Eventually, every company should have information security management governance on top of their IT services. These policy procedures will clearly show the benefits of outsourcing.</p><p><strong>What is your perspective on the advent of 5G in Oman? <br></strong>5G is much faster than 4G and allows for concurrent connections without being overloaded. The application that sits behind it needs to be intelligent and policy-driven to be able to provide adequate service. Under a 5G-enabled environment, data will need to be processed in data centers within microseconds, and there is a question about how many data centers in Oman can currently provide. Cloud Acropolis has this capability built in already by its 100GBPS internal connectivity as well as all needed technologies to ensure the full communication, storage and processing under 900 microseconds. Reliability of networks is also crucial, so Omantel, Ooredoo, and Vodafone have to ensure there is high availability to provide services based on 5G. There should be regulatory efforts in order to support the telecom industry to develop an advanced ICT ecosystem. Today, we have many IoT services in logistics and tracking devices; moving them to autonomous processes requires the client give a large amount of trust to the entire setup.</p><p><strong>What government efforts would you like to be made to support the progression and innovation of the ICT ecosystem in Oman? <br></strong>The telecoms industry needs to undergo a vigorous mindset and cultural change to favor the enablement of 5G. We do not see a thorough regulatory environment on top of the telecom industry. Telecom is extremely expensive; before COVID-19, we could not even use Microsoft Teams or VoIP systems. The future of Oman is within IT. When Ooredoo entered the market, it had to work hand-in-hand with Omantel instead of competing. When the third operator enters the market, perhaps the regulator will ensure the three players compete freely to manage prices and services. The peering between the two operators, Omantel and Ooredoo, does not happen in Oman, so a call between the two operators happens abroad, at a higher cost. The Ministry of Technology and Telecommunications is expected to turn things around, because, so far, the team has remained the same as the team of the Information Technology Authority. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does Hemaya play in Oman's digital transformation, and what are your priorities for 2020?<br></strong>Hemaya started as a non-profit with the goal of educating the public and private sectors, as well as schools, on information security. Eventually, we registered as a private company in 2015, offering beginner classes for students and employees and courses for IT professionals, as well as CEOs. We mostly focused on explaining how hackers could take advantage of users in a way that the public can understand. In 2017, we moved from being a non-profit to a for-profit business, stepping up to fill the gap in the market by providing cybersecurity consultancy. Word of mouth helped us get noticed, and, in 2018, Ooredoo signed an agreement with us to provide business-to-business information security services to their clients. Today, even the most important customers are not aware of the requirements for cybersecurity. Players are overspending because they are unable to evaluate their actual requirements and because they are misusing the protection measures that they purchased. As for our priorities, on the back of 55% YoY growth in 2019, we expect even faster growth in 2020. We are much closer to our target customers, including ministries and private companies. We also see a lack of awareness in the industry sector, where issues are rising. There is a link between operational solutions and business solutions, and this link needs to be protected to avoid interference with operations.</p><p><strong>What is the best strategy to increase organizations' security systems in Oman and strike a balance between reducing vulnerabilities and minimizing the consequences of cybercrime?</strong><br>There needs to be an equal focus on both areas. This is where we provide our business risk assessment service, which includes everything from preventing attacks to mitigation. This is difficult because board members want to see numbers to understand. We have had to change the discourse from technical to financial. However, globally, awareness around the need of cyber solutions is increasing in company leaders. They are hearing about attacks elsewhere on similar businesses, and the concern is there. Leaders are now asking for meetings and risk assessments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What roles does Al Jabal Al Akhdar Resort play in the Anantara portfolio and in Oman's tourism industry?<br></strong>Since its inception in 2001, Anantara has been creating hospitality experiences with the mission of bringing back the sense of excitement and anticipation that was once inherent to international travel—the true source of a globetrotting lifestyle, exceptional experiences, and self-discovery. Minor Hotels' luxury brand has bloomed into a collection of unique luxury hotels in both resort and city settings, delivered by a team of passionately dedicated hosts and discerning, curious travelers. Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar represents a prime example of this philosophy as one of the crown jewels of Anantara's portfolio. Perched at 2,000m above sea level on the curving rim of a canyon at the fabled Green Mountain, Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar is the highest-altitude five-star resort in the Middle East. It offers a unique luxury experience that is different from other hotels in Oman and the region. Having been recognized as the leading and award-winning luxury hotel with the highest accolades in the region, Anantara Al Jabal Al Akhdar has highlighted Oman internationally on the luxury hospitality front.</p><p><strong>How do you expect demand for your facility to evolve in the medium term?<br></strong>So far, demand has been increasing at a steady pace for the last three years. Oman itself has been getting more and more exposure as a prime travel destination in the Middle East. We are expecting positive growth in the next couple of years. One of the main factors affecting this growth will be the expansion of Oman Air, one of our key partners. Its growth will enable us to expand into new untapped markets such as China and North America. The vast expansion of the Sultanate's hotel portfolio highlights our clear positioning as an exceptional luxury mountain lifestyle resort and underlines the uniqueness of our offerings. We thrive to continually enhance our luxury guest experience by evolving with market trends and the needs of guests.</p><p><strong>How can luxury facilities in the Sultanate remain ahead of the innovation curve in face of rising competition and evolving trends?<br></strong>The very concept of luxury travel has been shifting in recent years, all in Oman's favor. High-end travelers are in a constant quest for unique and authentic experiences. This is where Oman's rich cultural heritage, natural wealth, and heartfelt hospitality come into play. We believe that modern luxury should not be cookie cutter or pretentious. The hallmarks of our approach are organic, non-formulaic, accessible, and intuitive experiences. We are known for our premium touches that have an energetic local spice, not faceless glamour. The kind of luxury and service we offer feels natural and at ease with our surroundings. One major trend in recent years is the rise of conscious tourism. This lines up perfectly with our culture of sustainability and environmental protection. As a lifestyle mountain destination, we are at the forefront in promoting the natural beauty of Oman and its adventurous spirit.</p><p><strong>What challenges is Oman currently facing?<br></strong>The main challenge is a logistical one. In terms of infrastructure, the transport network is still limited both on the international and local levels. Institutionally, the government has taken steps toward facilitating visitors' entry into the country and will hopefully continue to do so in the medium and long term. Furthermore, as tourism is one of the main pillars of the government's vision, educational institutions need to adjust their curriculum and academic portfolio to accommodate the rising demand for hospitality and tourism specialists.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic growth priorities?<br></strong>We are working closely with the Ministry of Tourism and local key players in the hospitality and tourism sectors to expand into new markets as well as to strengthen our presence in the main traditional markets such as Europe. It goes without saying that our growth plans are fully aligned with the National Tourism Strategy 2040. This includes creating job opportunities for locals, developing new projects, and highlighting the importance of sustainability throughout the Sultanate. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What was the driver behind the Ministry Digital Transformation Project agreement signed with the Minister of Tourism, and what are its main implications for the Omani economy? <br></strong>The project seeks to improve both the scale and quality of tourism in the country. It is part of a comprehensive effort to put Oman on the global tourism map by providing professional high-quality services to diversify our economy and to create jobs by offering the world enriching end-to-end tourism experiences with an Omani personality. E-services for all tourism establishments have now been simplified, and all tourism-related activities will maintain the highest standards of transparency through an executive dashboard. The main development services include over 100 e-services for investors, tourism development, planning and information, and tourism promotion. Essentially, it reduces the degree of bureaucracy and simplifies the experience for all stakeholders.</p><p><strong>What are the key priorities to drive concrete innovation across government bodies in Oman, and how will technological innovation define new roles for both the public and private sectors?</strong><br>The government has been undertaking several initiatives over the last few years aimed at strengthening the Sultanate's digital footprint and infrastructure. A key element of this process is standardization across different authorities and bodies, which has guaranteed interoperability. As such, Oman's policies and regulations are able to address the entire ecosystem in the same way. That being said, the move toward PPPs is a signal for the private sector's role to increase. This is a positive aspect that will keep things moving and will allow companies to lead the way in the innovation sphere. The flexibility and resources of the private sector will undoubtedly spearhead technological breakthroughs and redefine the role of the government on the regulatory side.</p><p><strong>How is the current Omani macro-environment impacting your business model and growth strategy, and how do you expect demand for your services to evolve in the medium term? </strong><br>The country's economy is picking up. Based on Oman's strong economic indicators, we are optimistic for the future; however, the last few years have pushed us to look for opportunities in Asian and African countries. More recently, we signed contracts with the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. These countries entail specific risks, but they also have a true need to digitalize their services and adopt e-solutions. The impact our solutions bring can thus be of the utmost importance, as they ensure transparency of financial transactions in societies affected by high levels of corruption. In the future, we see Africa as a huge untapped market where we can further expand by adopting build-operate-transfer (BOT) or PPP models. Government contracts will probably represent the most attractive commercial perspective for us, but, in terms of opportunities, both B2B and B2C interactions have enormous potential for development.</p><p><strong>What will be the challenges in meeting the growing number of connected devices, and what is the best strategy to strengthen security systems in Oman?</strong><br>The advent of IoT and interconnectivity will definitely pose deep challenges to global societies, not only Oman. It will thus be important to build the appropriate cybersecurity infrastructure and constantly update it, as one of the main aspects of cyber-security is the ability for anyone from anywhere to launch an attack. As such, partnerships between the public and private sectors and local talent able to fend off threats are crucial for the progression of the country. At times, we see former hackers being hired by governments to help them build smart cybersecurity systems. Oman is well-positioned with regards to cybersecurity, as recently showcased by our talented youth's ability to find a loophole in Apple's IOS. Overall, the government is investing capital to develop the IT sector and embrace the digital economy, and so far, the results are tangible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the major highlights in the past year for ODP?<br></strong>With the goal of diversification and gaining a competitive advantage over international players, we introduced Professional Services as a Service (PSaaS) to our portfolio. Since having begun our operations in 2012, ODP has accumulated a host of expertise both in the lines of top-notch certifications and local know-how in managing the various ICT challenges that are associated in this fast-paced, technologically-driven world. We understand that businesses of today have enough challenges focused on their growth, and we would like to address their ICT challenges through our PSaaS through offering advocacy and consultations for  infrastructure, software, disaster recovery, back-up, collocation, monitoring and classical services, so that businesses can focus on their core services. The banking sector, as well as the public sectors, have shown great interest in outsourcing as much as possible to reduce operational costs, and our PSaaS are at the forefront in guiding them to the right decisions. 2019 was also when we introduced our Cyber Security Centre, the first of its kind in Oman. Implementing a key element of our diversification strategy, ODP's Cyber Security Centre helped in turning a costly center into a profit-making center by sharing our knowledge with clients based on our three data centers. Security sits in the DNA of ODP, and the trust element is our competitive advantage in the cybersecurity field. For now, many of these cybersecurity initiatives are more reactive; however, with AI, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be more proactive, and we aim to use these industrial developments to serve our nation and our customers better.  We are also proud of our engagement with Microsoft after we launched Azure Stack Services, making it another first for Oman. This introduction of such world-class cloud solutions locally means that clients can save money and can offer better quality services, since their data can now stay within Oman's national boundaries.</p><p><strong>What are the main implications of the first virtual data center (VDC) as a service?<br></strong>We have launched Nebula, the first VDC in Oman that offers a full range of data center facilities from computing, storage, and networking to network security services on an OPEX model. Through Nebula, ODP provides data center infrastructure and facilities for rent or lease, along with the ability for customers to increase their usage requirements on demand. We offer two additional options of Nebula services: Lagoon Nebula offers a very competitive pricing model to meet the most stringent budgets, while Eagle Nebula targets entities wanting their own dedicated VDC, which we can set up in less than a day and ship to customers anywhere in the world. Future plans include expanding and introducing Eagle Nebula to other Middle East countries, Africa, and eventually other international markets. The physical data center will vanish in the next 10 years, and virtual cloud data centers will take over, as we are jumping into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with 5G as the catalyst.</p><p><strong>What will be the main implications and risks of the full adoption of IoT?<br></strong>As with any technologies, such as the introduction of GSM or the internet, there are pros and cons; however, the advantages always come up top. 5G and the Fourth Industrial Revolution will control and speed up our lives, transforming health, transport, and business operations. The revolution will be real; it just needs the proper infrastructure and time. Security will be a major concern, taking into account what is happening geopolitically today. Hacking disrupts systems, and, without an empowered cyber security in place, data can easily be compromised. The role of the government will thus be more shaped around the legislative aspect, to ensure this sector becomes more process-oriented and satisfies legal measures in terms of preserving and securing data. Data will dominate the whole world, be it from a business, economic, social, or political perspective. Data will have a deep impact, not only on assets, but also on health, which is why there needs to be proper legislative measures and an international effort mandated by international organizations around the Fourth Industrial Revolution. </p>]]></richbody0content>

For us, 5G is an opportunity to connect areas that were previously challenging to reach and requiring a long time-to-market. With 5G, we are targeting those cases by offering new solutions and services that serve customers' needs. In the short term, 5G is an alternative to traditional broadband technologies. As technology and the demand for technology is progressing at a solid pace, fixed wireless access is the main focus of current deployment. On the medium and long term, the increasing demand for highly customized products, as well as flexible production lines, will trigger the Fourth Industrial Revolution where 5G will play a major role in offering the main infrastructure that will pave the way toward the revolution's implementation.</p><p><strong>What are the market realities in terms of demand for services, and what strategic decisions will ensure Omantel is positioned for medium and long-term growth? </strong><br>At Omantel, we look at demand differently. The consumer demand segment is one of the largest revenue contributors, accounting for around 58% of our revenue, so we continue exploring data and lifestyle solutions like mobile and entertainment bundles. However, with the entrance of a third operator, it is important to diversify. In the last four years, we focused on developing the ICT business unit, providing various solutions to both government and the private sector. We have also expanded our wholesale global business, with much of our focus is on our Global Wholesale Transformation project that has further enabled us to transform from a regional hub to a global provider. We have investments in more than 20 subsea cables that serve areas covering more than 5 billion of the world's population. The main OTT content providers are hosted here in Oman and serve the GCC and other MENA markets. Additionally, in 2020, we are opening one of the most unique data centers in the region, which should attract many content providers as well as cloud operators into the country.</p><p><strong>How will the whole ICT landscape evolve in the long term, and what regulatory focus should be placed to ensure its evolution will be innovation-based?</strong> <br>Any long-term prediction in the ICT industry is hard to imagine, given today's extreme acceleration of change. Nonetheless, we predict that there will be a steep and steady curve toward opportunities arising from digital initiatives, cloud computing and security services, unified communication solutions, big data and analytics, IoT, and the rise in 5G technology. The traditional telecom business model will no longer be infrastructure-based, with the service layer bound to determine the survival of the entire industry. The rollout of 5G will no longer rely on huge base station towers, but will require every aspect of available infrastructure, from streetlights to other devices available around a city. Hence, infrastructure will become lighter, and the focus will shift to solutions. Digital disruption by innovators and startups will continue at a steady pace whilst giving rise to digital transformation initiatives to many enterprises across every major industry vertical. This will lead to tremendous growth in connected objects, giving way to an increase in ICT spending. The emergence of new digital technologies is expected to bring significant growth opportunities to the ICT business unit. All these aspects, however, will only be possible as long as there is a strong, deep regulatory understanding of the ICT and telecom environment. Oman should offer a clear sandbox to play in whilst allowing development and innovation. For example, currently there are stringent rules and regulations when it comes to data and the use of data for traditional telecom players. If we are to enrich lives and provide lifestyle services, it will be of the utmost importance that regulations are aligned with the evolution of the industry. There should be a fair level of regulation when it comes to both traditional operators and OTTs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the unique aspects of E-Census 2020 and why does it help Oman's economy in aligning with the Vision 2040 goals?<br></strong><span></span>In the same way oil used to fuel the Industrial Revolution, data today powers the current digital revolution, providing critical information for decision makers in all countries. In this regard, statistical data plays a crucial role in planning and guiding Oman's five-year plan, which is why the E-Census is an essential initiative for Oman's economy. The E-Census seeks to build a data bank integrated electronically to over 20 different government and private organizations for decision makers to get access to accurate reporting about population, housing, and establishments, and statistical indicators. It will be the first of its kind in using national data registers, eliminating the need for traditional field surveys previously done to conduct the census. As such, any kind of demographic and economic change based on specific indicators will be immediately reflected in the system. The scope of this effort is massive, with millions of records being sent from multiple organizations. This allows us to access an unprecedented amount of data that we then need to align with the different strategies the country is embarking on, such as Vision 2040.</p><p><strong>What stage of the implementation are you at and what strategies do you adopt to ensure companies and individuals comply with this project?</strong><br>Most E-Census tasks will be accomplished by the end of 2Q2020; by the end of 2020, the project will be 100% complete. To achieve this goal, both organizations and individuals play a vital role as we need them to update their data. We encourage both Omanis and expatriates to update their current addresses with the Royal Oman Police by adding their electricity account number as proof of residence. To ensure all stakeholders are aligned, we started this project with certain principles, including engagement and transparency. Building such a platform will positively impact and help the government in making decisions. As stated by the royal decree 55/2019, it is everyone's responsibility to provide census working teams with accurate information to execute their tasks.</p><p><strong>How do you think the public and private sector relationship will evolve in the segment of data?<br></strong>The end goal is having perfect synergies between the public and private sectors, as keeping data from the government might lead decision makers to make inadequate choices. Since data management is a large, lucrative field, regulations will be crucial in determining the rules of engagement between different stakeholders. In this regard, the National Center for Statistics and Information (NCSI) is currently developing a national data strategy in coordination with the different related agencies. The strategy aims to establish a sustainable environment where data can be managed and used as an asset through a set of initiatives across different themes in alignment with existing laws, policies, challenges, and national goals.</p><p><strong>How do you currently ensure the data E-Census receives remains safe?<br></strong>Protecting the data E-Census 2020 collects is our highest priority. We are committed to upholding the privacy, confidentiality, and security of personal information, as we are following legislation, laws, and best practices to protect the data.</p><p><strong>What are some potential benefits that could be acquired from the correct usage of data in the Omani economy?<br></strong>Given the crucial role that data today plays in fueling the world's economic activities, data accuracy, analysis, and interpretation are three essential elements that favor the correct usage of data in the ultimate goal of supporting the broader Omani economy and its stakeholders. Indeed, accurate data, properly analyzed and interpreted, would first benefit the public sector in its policymaking and regulations. Secondly, it would have an extremely positive impact on investors, who would be able to base their investment strategies on precise and rich information. Thirdly, the correct usage of accurate data will help the Omani SME segment invest in the data field and build applications that serve different sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of how operations have evolved in the past 12 months and the implication of recent developments?<br></strong>We still have our ongoing joint ventures and partnerships with regional and international investors doing six large, long-term integrated tourism projects (ITCs). In 2018, we opened the Crowne Plaza OCEC; in 2019, we opened the W Hotel Muscat, targeting both the international and domestic market; and in 2020, there is the opening of the JW Marriot OCEC, as well as the start of a third hotel in Madinat Al Irfan. This means we will complete our plan of having a three-, four- and five-star hotel service the Oman Exhibition and Convention Centre (OCEC). The joint venture with Majid Al Futtaim at Madinat Al Irfan kicked off in 2019 and in 2020 we will see the start of Phase I, which will cover 250,000sqm of mixed-use developments. Another achievement in 2019 was the completion of the Omantel Head Office in our Madinat Al Irfan Business Park. We also opened two “Atana Stay" hotels in Al Ashkhara and Salalah.</p><p><strong>Madinat Al Irfan is often dubbed the smart city of Oman. What is your definition of a smart city?<br></strong>A smart city is when various software and hardware elements are built into the infrastructure of the city and are integrated to provide a sustainable business and social lifestyle for the community, and create an environment for entrepreneurship and innovation. A smart city enables people and systems to work together to allow people to design how they want to live, work, and socialize, and use resources more efficiently and sustainably. Smart cities are not isolated as they will be able to connect with other smart infrastructure across the country and the world.</p><p><strong>Looking at the broader segment, what is your assessment of Oman as a tourist destination?<br></strong>We will see more investment from the private sector in hospitality as well as growth in the number of SMEs servicing the tourism sector. OMRAN has been a major driver of new hotels in Oman and has opened up some strategic locations such as Jebel Akhdar, Musandam, and Salalah, which were identified in the 2040 Strategic Tourism Plan as focus areas for tourism growth. Private companies are now beginning to develop these areas, which means the government can use its resources in new areas. The government has given a lot of confidence to investors by investing in key infrastructure, including tourism anchors like the OCEC complex and ITCs. Oman is now looking at implementing a more convenient “one-stop shop" approach to provide investors with the kind of market information that will help them arrive at an appropriate investment decision.</p><p><strong>What are the major trends in Oman, and how are you incorporating them in your asset management strategy?<br></strong>Asset management looks at how our assets engage the tourism sector more. For this reason, our asset management strategy is both financial and experiential, since our hotels need to create an authentic Omani experience that connects tourists with the local culture, history, and people. We seek to create more in-country value in terms of supplying goods, services, and experiences, and Omani SMEs will play a major part in that push.</p><p><strong>Where do we stand in terms of asset privatization in the real estate market?<br></strong>OMRAN has focused its efforts on the hospitality sector and is now the largest owner of hotels and resorts in Oman. OMRAN has been developing new hotels and renovating old properties to create value and make them attractive for the private sector. Our preferred option is to create a new investment company that will own the largest and best hotel assets and then sell 49% of the shares to both local and regional investors. In three to five years, our plan is to launch is an IPO and be listed on Muscat Securities Market. A listed hospitality company would give local and international investors the opportunity to invest in one of the fastest-growing tourism markets in the Middle East. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is your company positioned during the COVID-19 crisis?<br></strong>We have continued to serve our customers throughout the pandemic, albeit in ways that look a bit different. From the earliest days, we set out a clearly defined business continuity plan to support all of our business functions and implement all official directives relating to health and hygiene. Our first priority is, of course, the health and safety of our employees, customers, and the wider community. Meanwhile, we have focused on continuing to serve our customers in a dedicated and delightful manner, while ensuring they feel cared for when using our services.</p><p><strong>What efforts did you make to maintain your operations during the lockdown period?<br></strong>We implemented rigorous health and hygiene protocols and a work-from-home policy for all administrative employees while taking precautionary and preventive measures to safeguard the remaining staff and our contractors. This was monitored by our CEO, David Kalife, who, along with his management team, visited a number of service stations to ensure that all health and safety rules are maintained to the highest standards. With our newly launched OOMCO World app and several digital payment options eliminating the need to handle cash, we have continued to offer our customers smarter ways to shop and re-fuel while minimising physical contact, making their lives easier and enjoying their time with OOMCO.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the post-COVID-19 era?<br></strong>Our promise—you trust, we care—has never seemed more important than it is now as we face this global pandemic. Building on our customer-centric approach we are continuing to prioritise our customers' safety, while finding ways to support them during this challenging time. At our service stations, customers are provided with four payment options to minimize interaction, including the new Basma Plus prepaid fuel card and the OOMCO World app. We are also offering even greater benefits from using our services, one such example being our collaboration with NBO to offer 15% cash back on fuel for credit card users.</p><p><strong>What lessons have you learned from this crisis?<br></strong>Challenges always arise when applying and following a new work system, and although remote work mechanisms have been applied for more than a decade, it took the pandemic to really see it applied on a large scale. Yet, by being responsive and adaptive, we have been able to thrive. In the fuel marketing sector, the biggest challenge remains maintaining productivity and sales. But through the business continuity system and the various precautionary measures that we are implementing to face the current situation, we hope to maintain the level of productivity and continue to meet the requirements of our customers at all times.</p><p><strong>What further challenges do you anticipate in 2020/2021 going forward and how are you preparing for them?<br></strong>Companies need to develop plans and work systems that ensure the continuity of their business and at the same time maintain the health, safety, and security of their customers and employees. Of course, all companies must think about the lessons learned from the current situation by reassessing the mechanisms they follow and setting future and precautionary plans in order to be able to face such catastrophes and health disasters. For example, companies have to invest in innovative technologies that ensure the continuity of their business through a remote work system and virtual meetings, as well as remote payment technologies and many others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the significance of 2019 for your business?<br></strong>HTC established its energy department in 2016 as part of its growth and diversification strategy. 2019 saw this department achieve operational breakeven. A second 2019 achievement includes successfully reaching out and engaging with international and local solar developers to establish partnerships to address local market needs. This is significant, as a key missing aspect in our solar offering was the financial element allowing for plant leases over capital investment. Finally, 2019 was more about efficiency and utilization of manpower. We also introduced KPIs to monitor our employees' productivity. We looked at projects related to the fourth industrial revolution and started carrying out them as sub-contracts, which allows us to better understand the market and the technologies themselves.</p><p><strong>What challenges prevent you from engaging with the B2C market?<br></strong>B2C is a huge market with various hurdles. First, there is a fragmentation of technologies. However, Apple, Amazon, Google, and Zigbee Alliance have founded a consortium to standardize their different protocols. If this consortium develops a single standard of interoperability, this will help galvanize the market. Right now, there are some suppliers for home automation services but there are two different business models. Unifying the standards means the new model will start to erode the margins toward a service market, and we will see something in the middle, which is typically where we play in. The second issue with the B2C market is that the utility tariffs for water and electricity are extremely low, and the incentive for efficiency is low. The third issue is the electricity sockets and light switches. Usually, for home automation to work properly, you need to have a live, neutral cable going. However, in Oman, homes can only have a live, ground cable, not a neutral one. This blocks 95% of the home automation market, as homes need to be able to send their data to a command center. As such, we are trying to understand the safety and technical aspects of this divergence and see how we can address it.</p><p><strong>Do you think tariffs will go up and there will be more awareness?<br></strong>Privatization is having an effect on demand, since Oman is extremely cyclical in terms of energy consumption, as winter and summer demand differ hugely. We have many plants that lie idle during certain times, while there are extremely specific peaks at other times; so, on the demand side, energy storage could be used to fix this. Distribution companies could install batteries in your house at their cost and when the demand and tariff cost are low, they start storing energy. Meanwhile, when demand and tariffs go up, energy could be pumped from the batteries, meaning there is no need for generators. What makes it challenging is that our tariffs are attractive for manufacturers, so solutions will have to wait until they mature. If you do not have a serious challenge, there is no motivation for innovation. If there were carbon credits, they would be another driver toward efficiency and smart solutions. If it remains as it is, it will be challenging.</p><p><strong>What are your objectives and priorities for 2020, and what are the drivers behind them?<br></strong>In telecoms, we purposely chose niche segments that we can excel in and that are typically passed over by the majority of solution providers. As such, we will keep on with our operational efficiency initiative and seek new markets to apply a strategy based on IoT and energy efficiency. The solar industry will grow exponentially in the commercial and industrial segment (where we operate in), and we will remain agile to capitalize on our position to continue leading the market share and value delivered to customers. Finally, we now have maturity and autonomy in telecom and energy, and moving forward we will seek more interaction between the two departments to leverage on markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[looking-at-the-big-picture]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were your key highlights of 2019, and how do they reflect your strategy for both the short and medium-term?<br></strong>The key achievement of 2019 was we started commissioning the Al Amarat plant, which was delayed for a few years. We also finished two projects linked to Al Amarat that allowed us to increase the number of connected people—from 116,000 to 126,000 in Muscat and from 34,000 to 39,000 in RG. We managed to install IVMS on all yellow tankers, which led to an increased number of trips to STP with the wastewater tankers from close to 250,000 to almost half a million. From a technology point of view, one of the key projects for us is converting sludge into energy, and we will spend more resources on that. Our focus is to move quickly, especially for the big project execution, hoping to get more funds in the coming years. There is a long way to go, especially in reverse osmosis, where connectivity is almost 4-6%. Within these short-term targets, our medium-term strategy is to expand internationally. This big picture thinking will allow us to solve our local issues and raise our standards, pushing forward a restructuring that will then help us expand into the GCC and other Arab countries.</p><p><strong>What does the new PPP law mean for the utilities, and where do you see gaps within Oman's wastewater industry?<br></strong>A new PPP and Privatization Law were implemented at the end of 2019, which shows how seriousness the government is about private partner involvement. On our side, we are looking to engage with a private player in the Misfaa STP project to help bring funds and develop it faster, better, and cheaper than Haya Water. We want to learn from them, as this will help our goals for international expansion.</p><p><strong>How is this increased efficiency playing a role in the push to get SMEs into the ecosystem?<br></strong>SMEs are key for Haya Water, and we started looking at them in 2013, before Riyaada was established in the market. We had a plan as part of our 2014 KPIs to develop and support SMEs, and we have already won two awards from Riyaada as a large company supporting SMEs. In 2019, we awarded contracts to 10 SMEs to do wet connections in Al Amarat, and they are doing an excellent job at a lower cost than main contractors. Slowly, small projects around OMR1-1.5 million can be given to SMEs. When water pipes are short and straight, it is easy; however, with wastewater, the pipes are longer in different directions, and it can be difficult for SMEs to take on such projects. We slowly gear them up for that. In 2019 and 2020, we carried out training programs for SMEs in three batches, 47 SMEs in 2020 alone. We instructed them on how to bid for projects, bookkeeping, and finance, and how to prevent the common mistakes made when bidding for our jobs.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020?<br></strong>The market is extremely dynamic at the moment, and there are many forces. COVID-19 has driven oil prices to below USD30, and, as the budget was based on USD58, on a daily basis we lose USD28 million. Therefore, we have to borrow that money in order to meet the budget requirements, and we are all affected by the developments. The government has told us how much we will get this year; however, if it does not have money, we will have to reduce our budget. We need to work through those scenarios and risks, as 2020 has been a challenging year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has your strategy to expand and cover the whole country evolved over the last year, and what have been the major highlights?<br></strong>We have come a long way since we embarked on our journey to provide sustainable waste management practices in the country. We have closed down over 300 traditional dumpsites across the Sultanate. Our strategy for developing municipal solid waste (MSW) involved setting up the required infrastructure of engineered landfills and transfer stations in all governorates and outsourcing 10 service contracts to cover the collection and disposal of municipal waste across the country. We have established 10 engineered landfills and 14 transfer stations so far and all are operational. For healthcare waste, we are using a network of three healthcare waste treatment facilities treating waste generated from all governmental and private hospitals and clinics. We are also handling industrial hazardous waste at our established facilities in North Al Batinah and in Duqm. These facilities are part of our integrated hazardous waste treatment facilities. The second phase of this project will witness the establishment of an incineration unit, a physical and chemical treatment unit, and a solidification unit. The completion of the integrated hazardous waste treatment facilities shall bring a sustainable solution for the treatment of industrial hazardous waste and provide the required support for our industrial sector. In reference to our strategic goal of reducing the amount of waste disposed at landfills, our diversion strategy paves the way for the initiatives and projects that are in the pipeline to achieve that goal. To highlight a few, we signed a memorandum of understanding with PDO for the development of a waste-to-steam project for the application of enhanced oil recovery. We are also cooperating and facilitating the operations of two lead acid battery recycling facilities. In addition, we have allocated 20 sites across the Sultanate to receive, handle, and recycle construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste. Similarly, there are investment opportunities to utilize end of life tires (ELT). Another major highlight is the new private-sector investment to establish a paper recycling plant at Sohar Industrial Estate. In addition, be'ah will supply around 30,000 tons per annum of tire-derived fuel, providing Oman Cement Company a fuel alternative to help reduce the consumption of valuable natural gas. Biogas projects are also key components of be'ah's diversion strategy. These projects combined will provide the Omani market with jobs and increase in-country value, offering various investment opportunities. They will also contribute to Oman's renewable energy target (renewable sources covering 30% of energy demands by 2030) and offset the environmental impact caused by increased waste generation.</p><p><strong>What is the key to getting the banking sector involved in the process of developing a circular economy?<br></strong>Financial institutions are key enablers to move to a circular economy, so we need to have different key factors in place. One is the government, by enabling and facilitating the proper legal framework. Then there are the financial instruments such as fees. There is also the extended producer responsibility scheme (EPR). These are mainly applied on other waste streams such as electronics, tires, and packaging materials. A nominal fee is to be charged on such products, then that EPR fee will go to a fund that will finance the activities related to the recycling and treatment of such waste streams. This framework will provide incentives for producers to change product designs and adopt innovative ways that are environmentally friendly and a great opportunity for financial institutions to foster innovation among SMEs by providing some incentives for these projects.</p><p><strong>What technological upgrades are you expecting to have the greatest impact in meeting your targets?<br></strong>There are a great deal of tried-and-tested technologies used in the waste management sector, with most focus being directed recently on enhancements to increase efficiency. Most importantly, what we are working on now is the control tower, which connects all our operations under one system by integrating different data sources such as sensors, CRMs, IVMS, and smart devices across various touch points and operational units. This system will enable us to monitor operations, capture and analyze data, and generate reports. The artificial intelligence to be applied on this wealth of information will help us streamline our current operations, making them more efficient. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[renewable-energy-on-the-horizon]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights of 2019 and your expectations for 2020 in this regard?<br></strong>We have looked at recent developments in renewable energy, whether solar, wind, or other options, and at the ease of disposal of diesel, subsidies, and environmental factors, to determine if they are feasible. Oman's National Vision also has the goal of 30% renewables by 2030, so Tanweer is a contributor to the country's wider vision. In 2019, one of our achievements was to take over a 50-MW wind project. That was commissioned, handed over to us, and is in the operational stage contributing to the grid in southern Oman. We are also in an advanced stage with respect to other renewable energy procurement activities. We have identified 11 sites where we have done expressions of interest and the pre-qualification stage. Hopefully in 2020, we will finalize the procurement cycle for these 11 renewable energy sites and then award these projects. Besides these activities, Tanweer is also involved in efficiency improvements and competencies development as we look to the renewable energy horizon.</p><p><strong>What will be Tanweer's main procurement activities in 2020 in each of its licensed areas?<br></strong>For Phase I of our hybrid renewable projects for the 11 sites, we have already passed the pre-qualification stage. We are now onto the technical bidding stage. This is why we have only qualified 15 out of the 60-plus consortiums that expressed an interest. We are at the stage where the consortiums have to submit their technical proposals for maximizing renewable energy resources and improving efficiency. The 15 consortiums are a mix of local and international portfolios of companies. It is encouraging to see this mix of different types of commercial arrangements. We are not sure if all of them will continue through the tendering stage or if some will drop out because there are elements of these 11 sites that are extremely challenging. We are working on Phase II of our renewable hybrid program, and it will come once we have identified a few more sites. However, we want to go through the learning cycle of this first phase before we move on to other projects.</p><p><strong>The 50-MW Dhofar Wind farm is an important milestone for the GCC region. What does it mean for Oman's energy mix, and what role will wind energy have in completing Oman-wide electricity coverage?</strong><br>Wind potential is strong in southern Oman, and solar potential is strong in the north. Dhofar is the first of many wind projects in the pipeline. Having 50MW is insignificant in terms of the overall potential in that area. Any investment in wind technology would have to cope with the demand in that area. In the future, we expect there to be inter-connection between the north and south. If that happens, we will be able to add much more capacity than 50MW. It will definitely be a significant contributor to Oman's energy mix; however, the main driver will be the planning of these projects to cope with the growth in demand, as well as the inter-link between north and south Oman. The interlink project is progressing and will go all the way to Duqm in Phase I, which will be operational by 2023.</p><p><strong>Will we witness any milestones in 2020 regarding these disruptive technologies?<br></strong>Yes, automatic meter reading is one of them. That will be a game-changer. Instead of manual readings and issuing of bills, we are moving more toward automated meter readings and green bills. The water sector has stopped printing bills. We have to do that too, but in a way that is controlled and managed. We do not want to leap into disruptive technology that leads to immediate unemployment. For example, we have a number of meter readers, so changes such as introducing smart meters have to include re-skilling those people into other fields, such as analytics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Madrid Chamber of Commerce, or Cámara Oficial de Comercio, Industria y Servicios de Madrid founded in 1887, represents, promotes, and defends the general interests of economic agents in the region. Can you tell us about the chamber's mission and vision, and its evolution in recent years?</h4><p>The chamber has more than 130 years of history and internationalization has been an essential part of our work. Since the beginning, our main goal has been to help all the companies that are based in the Autonomous Community of Madrid become more competitive and adaptive.  To that end, the chamber provides essential services such as training, internationalization, and digitalization. On top of this, we have a national arbitration court. In addition, the chamber provides support for the certification process of different licenses and a lab that can support a number of our member's operations. We are a privately-funded organizations, and one of our main targets is to promote public-private collaboration and help both sectors to move toward the same direction. We strive to ensure the government's assistance is received by private companies and produces the intended results. During this entire process, the chamber oversees the implementation of public-sponsored initiatives by private firms.</p><h4>What is the chamber's assessment regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the socio-economic environment and what specific actions has it taken to support its members? </h4><p>The situation is improving. The economy is getting better; however, we still do not foresee the survival of many companies in the short term. Therefore, it is crucial to extend the loan period for some of the government-sponsored loans. Loans that have to be repaid within five years should be extended by two years. This is one fundamental step that can be taken to help companies. Another important factor is the capacity of companies to adapt to different economic cycles. The ERTE for temporary layoffs is an important mechanism that has helped to ensure the survival of many private companies. As for the chamber, we have provided consultancy services amid the pandemic in an attempt to explain to SMEs the main characteristics of the ERTEs. We have reinvented ourselves as well. We have organized virtual meetings to promote services that Madrid-based companies can offer to international clients whilst maintaining some of our international missions. Besides, we have managed to continue offering an outstanding service despite the shift to remote work. The arbitration court has continued to operate despite the health emergency. Our lab has been affected the most because many companies implemented remote work policies and did not send their employees. We continue to host events to help our members. Some of the events were scheduled to be in-person, but we turned them into virtual events.</p><h4>Financing, labor flexibility, and adequate taxation are three main measures that the chamber has proposed to accelerate the reactivation of the economy. How is the chamber working to advise companies about ICO credit loans?</h4><p>We are working directly with ICO, which is a government office, in order to clear any doubts companies may have that cannot access ICO credit loans. In addition to resolving some of their concerns, we support them by getting all the necessary documentation in order. The pandemic has dealt a huge liquidity blow, and in such a scenario the ICOs are essential to ensure businesses can cope with the crisis. We are providing advisory services and resolving any concern in an attempt to guarantee that each business will receive an ICO loan.</p><h4>What requirements must companies meet to join the chamber?</h4><p>Every company can become a member. We also have an exclusive section through our Club Cámara that offers an extra service. Some of the Club Cámara members are El Corte Inglés, Sabadell, Iberia, and several medium-sized companies.</p><h4>The chamber offers a personalized talent search service through the internship management portal #Talentoteca de Fundación Universidad-Empresa. How does the chamber help companies find the best available talent?</h4><p>We believe in training as a method to make companies more competitive. This includes training for individuals who are yet to join a company as well as training for executives that require a better knowledge in some areas. The post-COVID world is going to be more efficient via digital tools. In order to make the most out of those tools, it is necessary that businesses hire the best talent in the market. Since younger individuals already possess a variety of digital skills, we introduced the Talentoteca program to help students enter the job market through internships. Nearly 85% of the people who start internships under the Fundación Universidad-Empresa program go on to work for their companies. Every company can be a part our training programs, including those who are not part of our chamber.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2020 and for 2021?</h4><p>Our aim is to continue focusing on internationalization, training, and arbitration. In the arbitration area, we think that we can help many companies in reaching agreements with their suppliers in order to find an optimal solution for both parties. Digitalization is another one of our focus areas. We intend to continue supporting entrepreneurs, and provide consultancy services for businesspeople. We want businesspeople to feel that the chamber is always there to support them. We know businesses and the problems they face, so we are well positioned to help them resolve current problems and prepare for future challenges.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You sit on the board of different companies, ranging from the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector to agro-industry. What impacts of COVID-19 have you observed across sectors? </h4><p>At the beginning of the lockdown, we saw an increase in demand for essential FMCG, which has kept steady until today. On the downside, we observed some problems in the supply chain due to a decrease in the volume of imports and ships arriving at Mozambican ports. We faced delays of up to 60 days. As a result, we have experienced lack of stock of raw materials or packing material. Another negative effect of COVID-19 has been the reduction in the supply of foreign currency and the depreciation of the metical, which has pushed the price of imports up. The entire economy is suffering and the market is volatile, so we have simply done our best to maintain a positive cash flow, while abiding by all the preventive measures set up by the Ministry of Health. Looking at the bright side, the COVID-19 crisis has proven that the domestic industry is capable of meeting demand, as there has been no shortage of items nationally. I hope this will serve as a lesson for the future and help us reduce our reliance on imports and increase local production.</p><h4>How would you characterize the company's growth trajectory over the years? </h4><p>MEREC started over 20 years ago with one maize mill producing 100 tons per day. In over two decades, we have seen impressive growth, now producing more than 2,000 tons per day with four premises: two in Maputo, one in Beira, and one in Nacala. We employ close to 520 people. We currently produce 268 tons per day of maize and about 1,500 tons per day of wheat. We also have three pasta plants producing more than 200 tons per day. We export pasta to Malawi, South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. We are also capable of producing of 24 tons of biscuits and 280 tons of animal feed per day. MEREC's growth was temporarily halted in 2016, following the hidden debt crisis, when the currency rapidly devaluated from 30 to 80 meticais to the dollar and interest rates increased from 12% to 30% in the space of just a few months. This forced us to bring private equity in the company. From 2019 onward, we started recovering, despite being hardly hit by cyclone Idai in Beira, where our facility was down for almost 60 days. Now, we are looking forward to the end of COVID-19 so we can finally find opportunities to grow.</p><h4>What are the best opportunities for growth in the local market? </h4><p>Mozambique's population is rapidly growing. According to some estimates, it will double in 20 to 30 years. We mainly cater for the urban population, since rural households normally grow their own crops. We estimate the urban population to grow in this timespan from the current 36% to 50%, with a subsequent increase in formal employment and purchasing power. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect demand for our product to double. We are accompanying this growth not only by increasing production capacity, but also by entering more and more into value-added products, where we expect to see growing demand in the future. We are already seeing a growing interest in the market for products such as pasta, biscuits, and bread, which was virtually non-existent when we first started; we are in the process of converting part of the wheat or maize flour we produce into value-added products, including specialty flour for products such as muffins or croissants. Similarly, on the protein side, we have a observed a gradual diversification of consumption behavior from fish to poultry. We will see the same happen with meat in the near future. For our business, this means a foreseeable increase in the demand for animal feed. Overall, we are adding value to our produce and by doing so we are solidifying our brand. We are brand conscious and we want to create a bridge between the different segments.</p><h4>How should Mozambique leverage its agricultural potential and boost exports? </h4><p>Mozambique has an enormous potential not only to serve its rapidly growing population, but the region as a whole. The country's large surface of land available for agriculture a well as its ports have endowed it with a competitive edge to South Africa, which is currently the main agricultural supplier for the region. To the contrary, Mozambican production is mainly oriented to the local market. A major obstacle, in my opinion, is SADC agreements for exports, whereby SADC countries have somewhat agreed on an open borders policy. While Mozambique adheres to this, the same cannot be said for other countries. This results in foreign goods obtaining easy access to the Mozambican market, while Mozambican exports struggle to remain competitive abroad, as they are subject to surcharge tax or certification requirements. I believe that if neighboring countries were to open their borders and adhere to the SADC agreement, Mozambique would be highly competitive. Once this is in place, there is no reason why Mozambican products would not be able to accommodate for the growing demand in the region. Even on the global scale, Mozambique could play an important role as provider of specific lucrative goods such as coconut oil, but the lack of certification often means that local produce never leaves the country. As a market leader in the agro-industry sector, MEREC is pushing for certification and lobbying the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to invest in local labs that can produce international certification. This is key as it will allow us to reach new markets and increase our exports, thereby fulfilling our full potential.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your contribution to development in Mozambique?</h4><p>Tongaat Hulett Mozambique plays an extremely important economic and social role in Mozambique. Our two sugar factories in Mafambisse and Xinavane have a combined installed capacity of 340,000 tons of sugar, equal to 60% of the potential production in Mozambique. In terms of jobs, we have close to 10,000 employees, which provide for around 50,000 people in their families. In fact, we are the largest private employer in the country. Through strategic sourcing for communities, we always ensure we procure from local Mozambicans when it comes to services. We also contribute socially in terms of educating local communities, providing drinking water, and supporting recreational activities and sports. We have also been able to assist in building three bridges for roadways. During the COVID-19 emergency, we teamed up with the Ministry of Health to establish isolation centers in the two hospitals near our operations and provide beds and equipment. We also bought around 50,000 face masks and 80,000 liters of ethanol to make sanitizers, all of which we have distributed between employees and the surrounding districts where we operate.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the renewal of investments in your sugar plants in 2020?</h4><p>At the start of 2020, the head of our management team decided to give impetus to resuscitate business in Mozambique. The main focus with the investment was the restructuring of the business, or rightsizing, as we refer to it. Our aim is to match the business to the best industry practices in the sugar sector and ensure that the cost of production is competitive with Brazilian products, which is the world's leader. We looked at how to improve the yield on the production side, thus boosting operational efficiency. We pledged to process 365,000 tons of cane for the production of 38,000 tons of sugar in Mafambisse Mills, Sofala Province, and 1,5 Million tons of cane for production total of 175,000 tons of sugar, being 60,000 of refined and 115,000 tons of raw sugar in Xinavane Sugar Mill, Maputo Province. These measures will bring significant financial improvement in terms of our performance and return us to be competitive on the market.</p><h4>What are your main markets for the Mozambique operations?</h4><p>We have three markets. One is the domestic consumer market, where we see great potential for growth. Sugar per capita consumption in Mozambique is still low, at 8kg per year, compared to 36kg in South Africa or 24kg in Zimbabwe, but the prospects of macroeconomic growth will inevitably push an increase in the consumption of products. From this perspective, Mozambique is a key market that will become increasingly important for the strategy of our group as a whole. This is the market for day-to-day consumption, and we want to protect it by ensuring that the sugar we produce for mass consumers is vitamin fortified, so to enhance the nutritional value for the public and community. The second is the industrial consumers, predominantly composed of beverage companies. They used to import refined beverage sugar at a bottler level quality, but we have installed and commissioned a brand-new refinery to serve this industry; we can refine up to 90,000 tons of sugar annually, and in 2020 we will do up to 60,000 tons. Finally, we have the export market. We do have quotas under the US tariff quotas, so we export into designated markets, as well as East Africa.</p><h4>What improvements does Mozambique's agroindustry need to boost production and exports?</h4><p>Mozambique has a great deal of export potential, but in order to fully leverage it, there are two things the country should do. First, we want to see a reduction in the bureaucracy around the process of exporting. Second, we advocate for more subsidies and incentives to promote the industry; these are key, if we look at the success of India or Brazil. As a member of the Association of Sugar Producers of Mozambique, we have presented these issues to CTA, and we want to involve the government in productive discussions.</p><h4>Looking at 2020 and the future, what are the main objectives?</h4><p>With regard to 2020, our main goal is to survive the economic and health impact of COVID-19, just like all other economic sector. In the long term, we are looking at diversification; sugar is not only about making one product. We are in talks with investors about the possibility of installing an ethanol plant in Mozambique. There is still no such plant here, but there is one in Malawi and one in Zimbabwe. We can use byproducts such as carbon dioxide at an ethanol plant, and can tap into the automobile industry by providing blend fuel, which is widely used in Malawi and Zimbabwe. We need to look at an all-inclusive, integrated production line long term, where we use all the available resources that we produce and minimize as much utilization of foreign currency. That will boost employment, create forex, and grow the industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which ways does Moza Banco contribute to financial inclusion?</h4><p>Moza Banco has been one of the banks at the forefront of financial inclusion in Mozambique, by launching innovative products and services for the non-banked and creating new models of banking to further push inclusion. As the only bank with an almost entire Mozambican capital, our responsibility toward inclusion, innovation, and development is even greater. To date, we own the third-largest network of banks in the country, with 67 units in all provincial capitals and various districts, and we are looking to further increase this number, once the current COVID-19 scenario allows. We are also aware that financial inclusion cannot be reached simply through the expansion of our physical branches and must combine alternative channels, including digital services and products that allow us to address the needs and concerns of the lower segments. This is currently a focus of our strategy, as we expand our offerings to stand-up to the innovation, functionality, and efficiency that denote best practices across the market. We are complementing these efforts with actions to boost financial literacy and education, in order to ensure an effective and conscious utilization of financial services.</p><h4>Moza Banco has gone through a few difficult years following the crisis that started in 2016. How did the bank manage to emerge from this crisis?</h4><p>The history of Moza Banco has unfortunately not been a linear one, culminating in an inevitable and much-needed intervention from the central bank in 2016. Since then, the bank has achieved a remarkable performance, with proven positive results in gaining clients' and the market's confidence as well as economic and financial indicators. This process was amply certified by the entry of new shareholders A Kuhanha and ARISE, which now hold the majority of the institution's capital and the acquisition of niche bank Banco Terra. The fusion through incorporation resulted in a vaster and more complex operation of Capital Restructuring for Moza Banco, which led the bank to become a universal bank—even though with a segmented market approach—and one of the main players in the national financial system, counting on a robust and functioning operational organization up to the highest international standards. It must be noted that the bank's recovery process was hindered in the past year by exogenous circumstances, i.e. the devastating impact of cyclones Idai and Kenneth and the current COVID-19 crisis. However, we are well placed to continue the positive route started in 2016, once the circumstances improve.</p><h4>How should the Mozambican banking sector structure its response to assist the economy during COVID-19? Specifically, what was Moza Banco's response to COVID?</h4><p>The central bank was quick to implement countermeasures to minimize the impact on the financial sector, such as the temporary relaxation on payment terms for companies and a 250-point reduction of interest rates. While vital measures have been taken to relieve the burden of preexisting borrowing, these have not proven sufficient to stimulate an increase in credit to support vulnerable families and enterprises. The current low appetite for credit in a context of weak demand and offer—due to the lockdown restrictions that were put in place to fight the pandemic—must be understood also in terms of a pre-existing environment detrimental to the growth of SMEs and employment and highly uncertain in terms of economic recovery across sectors. The central bank's measures must be rapidly complemented by decisive governmental measures to keep business flowing and safeguard jobs. As of July 2020, more than 25,000 people from 1,200 companies have already lost their jobs. In June, the government approved a MZN1-billion (USD15 million) line of credit for MSMEs affected by the pandemic. The challenge is not to make the terms and conditions for this line more readily accessible to the public. In terms of Moza Banco's response, our main strategic focus has always been the client. Since the beginning of the outbreak, we have shaped our response to support our clients during the difficult times. We have implemented a program to restructure credit responsibility, including debt moratoria to reduce the burden of pressure for both individuals and companies. We have incentivized the utilization of digital channels for transaction and account management, so to facilitate compliance with the State of Emergency restrictions on movement. We have also extended the deadline of all our clients' debit and prepaid cards. In our physical branches, we have proactively implemented all hygiene and safety measures recommended by the government, the National Health Institute (IND) and OMS, in order to ensure the wellbeing of all our stakeholder, workers, clients, and partners.</p><h4>Looking to the future, what are the main objectives for Moza Banco?</h4><p>The current context of macroeconomic uncertainty requires a constant and dynamic revaluation of priorities and objectives. Our main goal in the short term is to assist our clients during this critical phase, ensuring the continuity of our services with the highest safety standards. In the long term, we strive to continue betting on innovation and the digital world, incorporating new transformation technological platforms. We want to keep growing our commercial activities, capitalizing on the network of branches and increasing our range of products and services. We seek to do this by betting on our internal human capital and a constant optimization of our operational structure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Mozambique for Puma Energy's global operations? </h4><p>Puma Energy is a downstream company present in 18 African countries, 12 of which are thriving. We have been in Mozambique for 10 years. In Mozambique, we operate six lines of businesses: retail, B2B, aviation, bitumen, storage, and lubricants. Mozambique is one of our most promising markets. It ranks fourth in terms of potential for growth and first in terms of profit margins, which indicates that the market is in the maturity phase. My vision for Mozambique is that in five years it will become one of the biggest contributors for Puma Energy Africa.</p><h4>What are the most important segments for Puma Energy?</h4><p>At present, our greatest focus is on retail, where we want to grow our network and improve our customer service. B2B is also important because Mozambique still lacks the infrastructure to support its industry, so customers need solutions for their energy needs. Aviation is a growing market all over Africa; we are the market leaders in Mozambique, supplying to the seven major airports. Storage is important because of Mozambique's geographical position, which makes it a strategic corridor for inland areas as well as neighboring landlocked countries. Lubricants is also an important sector. We currently have terminals in Maputo and Beira, and we intend to grow our terminal capacity and build new terminals. The bitumen segment is currently lagging behind, given the huge drop in construction. In terms of clients, we are increasingly focusing on the needs of the oil and gas sector, which has high energy demands. We also want to target clients in the mining, agriculture, and fisheries industries.</p><h4>Would you say you have a strong brand in Africa? </h4><p>Unlike all the major oil and gas giants, we do not benefit from the same 100-year-old level of brand awareness, and this plays to our advantage. We are perceived as the young kid in the block; we benefit from a relatively young and fresh image and a colorful logo, which evokes agility, the ability to adapt quickly and provide the products and services that are in demand, and the creativeness of youth. All of this makes Puma Energy a particularly appealing brand for Africans.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>Despite the challenges on the global scale, I believe 2020 could turnaround Mozambique's economy. After years of preparation in the LNG industry, we are ready to put it all to ground and welcome investments. Mozambican companies are ready. Foreign investors who are interested in Mozambique should bear in mind that they will find a country that for decades has been eager to come out of poverty. They must understand the specificities of doing business in such an environment, which means understanding the history and culture of the country and being patient. It might be challenging at first, but Mozambique will quickly catch-up with the international expectations. If there is clear, honest dialogue between international and local players as well as between the private and public sectors, Mozambique will finally be able to develop without falling into the “resource curse“ trap.</p><h4>What improvement from a regulatory perspective are you advocating for? </h4><p>Mozambique has some of the highest tariffs for transit in the continent, which makes us completely non-competitive. Even though Mozambican ports represent in many cases the most logical gateways for incoming products in terms of time and distance, companies often choose other options to avoid paying high tariffs. This is killing the industry. Decreasing tariffs might represent a loss of revenue for the government in the short term, but the government should consider the resulting increase in traded volumes, which in the long term would bring in more revenue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an overview of ISCTEM?</h4><p>ISCTEM started in 1996 as part of a social investment project, and it has grown substantially since then. It started with three or four programs, and we now have 24. ISCTEM is now gearing up to transform into a university, focusing on fields such as health sciences, business management, architecture, law, and engineering.</p><h4>As ISCTEM is transitioning to become a university, how do you intend to improve the institution? </h4><p>Our mission is to educate people for the future. Improving the level of our education is a constant ongoing struggle for the institution and is key to placing ourselves in a strong position in the market, given that ISCTEM does not benefit from endowments, unlike other institutions. As an educational institution, there are three key areas where we can add value: management, curriculum, and lecturers. We intend to change and improve the way we teach, the spaces we work in, and the way we interact. We are also focusing on changing the language within the institution and delivering a better internal service. Another important step for our institution is our ongoing process of decentralization, whereby we aim to empower all employees to make decisions working toward our common goal of delivering quality education to our students.</p><h4>There is a high unemployment rate in Mozambique and many young graduates seek for employment abroad. Can the brain drain effect be limited? </h4><p>Brain drain is an inevitable consequence of the current conditions of the market, which is not sustainable and fails to meet the expectations of young graduates. Stopping the brain drain is not up to higher educational institutions, which are only present in a limited number. It is something that will organically happen with the growth of economic opportunities in the country. At the same time, we need our young graduates to go overseas and gain experience; it is crucial that they see what is happening in the world and understand how things can be improved in Mozambique. This way, they can add value to the economy and give back to the country.</p><h4>How hard is it for young graduates to find a job? </h4><p>The transition from higher education to the job market is more challenging now than it was in the past. This is due to the lack of growth in the labor market, a reflection of the economic crisis, and hyperinflation over the last four years. The government is operating on a fixed budget basis, which has reduced employment opportunities in the public sector. The market has witnessed a fall in foreign direct investment, especially for the middle tier, which has hindered job creation. Despite this rather grim picture, we are seeing a slow resumption of growth and movement in the socioeconomic fabric. You can see this, for example, by looking at the number of entertainment, restoration, and cultural possibilities that are changing the face of Maputo, the capital. These are indicators of new jobs being created as well as the growing purchasing power of the public. At ISCTEM, we are committed to facilitating the transition between school and work by offering a number of internships to our students. We are creating partnerships with private companies, finding ways to bring them close to the institution, and involving them in being part of our student's studying experience as well as of their future prospects. We are matching what we are doing as an educational institution with what the market needs in terms of competences and demands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With almost a decade in the Mozambican market, how would you describe Lenmed's experience in Mozambique?</h4><p>With over 35 years in healthcare, Lenmed is the one of the largest private healthcare group in South Africa. The group started in Lenasia and currently have 11 hospitals, two of which are out of South Africa (in Botswana and Mozambique). We entered Mozambique in 2009-2010 and opened in 2012, with a USD45-million investment, fully owned by Lenmed South Africa. The rationale behind opening in Mozambique was to serve the oil and gas industry and the growing population of expats. When I took over as General Manager, a currency devaluation and financial crisis drove a shift in our business toward serving local and long-term expats, which represent a larger spectrum market. The hospital is an impressive structure, built on 29,000sqm equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and machinery fully up to international standards. For this reason, we are now looking into obtaining hospital accreditation. In terms of performances, the hospital has been stable in terms of occupancy and numbers over the years. However, we have seen a strong drop in numbers since the start of the pandemic, equivalent to about 40% in revenue, because people are fearful of going to hospitals in this delicate time. However, we have faced the financial impact of COVID-19 thanks to the support that comes with belonging to a bigger group, and we look forward to growing in the future. We opened up a clinic in Bilene and have in the pipeline plans to open up primary healthcare centers throughout the country, in places like Nampula, once COVID-19 is over. We have seen a demand for oncology recently, so we plan to open up some chemotherapy units.</p><h4>What are the strong points of the hospital in terms of the services and specialties it offers?</h4><p>It is a specialist hospital, with a focus on all types of surgery, from general surgery to spinal surgery. We have a digital microscope, we do most orthopedics, neurology, general surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and pediatric surgery. We have adult and pediatric ICUs and a fully-functional neonatal unit. We also have a dialysis unit and a 24-hour call center. We have an advanced life support paramedic with equipment based on the premises 24 hours. We have radiology and a laboratory, and we are one of the three only locations in Mozambique to do PCR testing for COVID-19. The COVID-19 ward was created as a preventive measure at the beginning of the outbreak in an exterior part of the hospital, although we still have no patients there. It is a 22-bed isolation ward that is ready for the potential peak of the outbreak, with a dedicated operating theater, ICU, and delivery room. If COVID-19 hits Mozambique as hard as it did elsewhere, we are ready.</p><h4>Will we see an increase in the number of private healthcare facilities in coming years?</h4><p>I do expect a rise demand in private facilities in the south, with more facilities popping up to facilitate occupational health and GP work. To open such a facility, however, you need a great deal of investment and know-how. It will be hard to open facilities in the north, due to the lack of medical personnel. This will be an issue of concern, given the future developments expected in Palma and Pemba.</p><h4>What are your projections for the rest of 2020?</h4><p>We need to look at how we can flatten the curve of COVID-19. The government has been doing an excellent job in addressing the pandemic and imposing a certain set of measures, despite the obvious limitations in available means. The priority now is to manage the public's reaction to the pandemic and assure Mozambican citizens that they are taken care of.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was your performance like during the pandemic?</h4><p>Just like the pandemic impacted the entire economy, it also impacted us, and we changed our forecasted growth. We started 2020 with many projects that were deferred in February and were eventually cancelled. Many of them were expansion plans, so we had to evaluate if it will be possible to carry them out. As for our operations, we decided on March 17 to implement a remote working plan and follow the health measures to prevent the spread of the virus. We reduced our staff and sent some of our workers to other areas of the country to cover the workforce reduction.</p><h4>What are the main companies you are targeting?</h4><p>Our services are for industrial companies that have an extended geographical print and a broad need for human resources services. We can work for small companies, but large enterprises are the main firms that demand our services. We prepare tailor-made proposals for our clients. It is a personalized service. We are 100% involved and are a strategic partner for each one of our clients.</p><h4>What has been your experience as a Mexican company expanding into LATAM?</h4><p>Latin America is complex because each country has its particularities (own specific issues). The Peruvian market is extremely competitive, and our strategy is to differentiate ourselves through an app to develop surveys for market research. Our advantage is that we have a robust app that allows us to cover the difficult geography of Peru. We offer the same service for Guatemala.</p><h4>What are some of the projects you are working on?</h4><p>In Mexico, we work with Grupo Salinas, which is one of the most important companies in the country. Banco Azteca, Television Azteca, and other businesses that the group has, has allowed us to collaborate for over a decade with them .</p><h4>What are your current expansion plans?</h4><p>This year, the expansion plans were discarded. This is a year of survival, trying to save revenue, and consolidating certain business areas. We are pleased to have reacted in a resilient manner to the COVID-19 situation. We will certainly be stronger after the pandemic.</p><h4>Are you going to launch new products? </h4><p>We are planning on innovating our services. We are going to launch our own software for staff management that can offer a real time service to manage the workforce. This can result in a better service and a solution that is quicker and useful. We want to launch the product in December 2020. This will be an addition that will be part of our existing packages, instead of a single service. We will offer this within all of our proposals.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that your customers face?</h4><p>The business climate is bizarre right now. The government has made several decisions that are not aligned from the productive sector. The government sees businesses as their foes. The decisions of the government have affected the confidence of domestic and foreign investors, and the president's comments have not helped to build a positive business climate.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a successful entrepreneur, how would you characterize the country's environment for fostering entrepreneurship, whether in the gastronomy sector or otherwise?</h4><p>Panama is a country that, due to its history, idiosyncrasy and global outlook, has created over time the environment, propitious framework, and strategies to promote the entrepreneurship of multiple industries such as gastronomy, technology and telecommunications, logistics and transportation services, finance, tourism, and many others. That was exactly what I found in Panama upon my return. I was able to witness first-hand the formation of thousands of MSMEs and their growth, becoming the engine of the country's economy. The ease of settling into the country and the multiple benefits are one of the main attractions that make Panama an ideal place for the development and innovation of entrepreneurship.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that must be overcome to encourage more entrepreneurship in the country?</h4><p>Entrepreneurship poses multiple challenges that are addressed in the country every day such as promoting the formalization of enterprises, access to flexible credit, simplifying the procedures needed to establish a new company, reducing the tax burden for entrepreneurial projects, constant training and, above all, the identification and appreciation of entrepreneurs as managers of high-impact changes in the economy. These are key aspects that are being implemented, leading Panama to be much more competitive and a global benchmark.</p><h4>What long-term impact do you see the COVID-19 pandemic having on Panama's hospitality sector?</h4><p>The hospitality sector is a key sector in the country. The development of the hotel industry added to tourism and the promotion of gastronomy as a country brand and distinctive seal are key, and COVID-19 has put many of the projects on hold; however, Panama has visionary, hardworking people who know how to roll up their sleeves to get ahead. In the long term, COVID-19 will have a positive impact on the hospitality sector in terms of the development of important aspects such as improvement in customer service, the development of disruptive and highly creative ventures, the reformulation of projects aimed at putting the customer at the center of any idea (“customer centric"), and leveraging innovation and digitization to be more efficient and profitable.</p><h4>What is the most effective way for Panama's government to support the country's private sector—in particular, the hospitality sector—during the pandemic and recovery period?</h4><p>The hospitality sector was one of the worst hit sectors in Panama during the pandemic and support for it is key in terms of reactivating the economy. This industry generates thousands of jobs and sources of incomes. The government is promoting some measures for the sector and will continue to create mechanisms for its prompt recovery. In any case, the current situation means the most relevant actors of hospitality in Panama such as gastronomy, tourism, and hotels will work together and strengthen itself when creating a national strategy to export concepts that position our country as the “destination and the experience that you cannot miss" and not as one more “alternative" to many others. For this, the government must maintain a clear strategy and understand hospitality as one of the main axes for the economic recovery that we long for.</p><h4>What are your plans for Suvlas for the remainder of 2020 and 2021?</h4><p>For now, the main plans between now and the end of the year with Suvlas are to achieve the opening of all the branches and franchises that were affected by COVID-19 as well as the incorporation of collaborators. Likewise, we must adapt to the new reality and become more efficient, at the same time seeking to optimize the “food cost" of the entire operation. Additionally, we are preparing for the international expansion stage for the remainder of 2020 and during 2021, seeking to take Suvlas to international markets and thereby share to the world what we are capable of creating in Panama. However, these are not our only plans. From Meze, a site that represents the gastronomic culture of Greece in Panama and an enterprise that I have led for more than a year and a half, we have plans for the remainder of 2020 and during 2021 to continue sharing our passion and transmitting a unique experience. Likewise, as part of something positive and a product of the COVID-19 pandemic, I began venturing into the development of a differentiating concept of specialty coffee, which is completely new at the regional level and which I hope to promote a before and after in the industry.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the economy in the short to medium term?</h4><p>In the short term, the Panamanian economy faces a complex but not discouraging situation. Due to its strategic geographical position and its role in the world trade concert, Panama can once again generate interesting levels of growth in the medium term. It is not an easy task, but it is possible if we all contribute on our end. Entrepreneurship will be key in all this, and we are all prepared and believe that success can be achieved. We must continue to be what we are: “Panama, the bridge of the world, heart of the universe."</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the history of FacePhi? </h4><p>FacePhi was founded in 2012. The program is based on several algorithms to bring facial recognition to a massive market. When we began, we knew that facial recognition was for surveillance and accessing systems securely. We thought that with the right algorithms we could access the massive market. We also thought using a webcam for applications would help the financial sector and many others. In the beginning, we were unsure where and how to focus. However, after having many meetings with the different sectors, we decided to certify the technology after trialing the product in the financial sector. We worked with many banks to adapt the technology. We have the algorithm and the product. We were trying to adapt one to fit the other. We felt in order to have transparency, the company needed to go public. We did this for our image, showing that our company is being audited. We wanted the transparency. We are actually the only one that is public still today. Without any revenue or any client, we made this step on July 1, 2014. By the end of that year, we had closed several deals with banks in Costa Rica. We focus on Latin America because we thought the Spanish brand was well recognized in that region, and the technology is also well recognized in that market. While there was a financial crisis in Europe, Latin America was growing. Not only is it a market with money to invest, Latin America is also a region with a large amount of identity fraud. Once we had several cases for success, things snowballed from there. We have been closing deals with eight to 10 banks a year since. Today, we have more than 30. We ended 2018 with 6 million users and about 500 million applications for facial recognition. Now the company offers several biometrics in addition to facial recognition. There is a big demand for these in digital boarding, fulfilling the “know your customer“ (KYC) requirement. We are quite happy with 2018's results. We had an increase of 66% in revenue. The company is doing well.</p><h4>To what do you owe such an increase in revenue?</h4><p>Our expansion will continue here on out. We have a few accounts in Europe, however 85% of our revenue comes from Latin America. We have focused there and we find it easy to replicate success now that we are established. We have opened a subsidiary in Asia, in Seoul, Korea. We participated in the Singapore Money 2020 in March 2018. We see the market demand for biometric technologies. We have been going to different countries almost every month to analyze financial institutions and government regulation. The idea is also to open one in the US, which is a market that we need to touch. Europe will come step by step. I would not say that the competition is higher in Europe. There has not been a case of success for any company similar to FacePhi here. The regulation is extreme here in terms of privacy concerns, which is why we are always behind the US and Latin America. I would say the UK has slightly more open regulation, and we have a few proofs of concept with some banks there. It is true that in Latin America we want to increase awareness of disruptive technology. People were initially weary of using biometrics and its implications. We combined our efforts with the financial sector. I also do a lot of conferences to explain the technology and user experience. There is still a lot of work to do. However, we are already looking at biometrics differently than we did five years ago. Three years ago, web banking was a top priority for banks. Now it is mobile applications. All technologies related to this mobile world are at the top of the digital transformation for the big entities. I see this trend continuing.</p><h4>In what other sectors do you see growth potential?</h4><p>The financial sector is the top client that we may have for facial recognition, for example, with ATMs. I would say that e-commerce and e-health are sectors impacting this technology. The government is now implementing these kinds of technologies. They are all related to the actions citizens are capable of doing by using mobile applications from any entity. That is where biometrics will be implemented as a method to identify customers. Before biometrics, we could not say who we were. We have some alliances with companies that are investigating new algorithms. It will be a long path, but it is going well. There is a balance between convenience and security with biometrics, so that the battle for privacy and data concerns is being won by biometrics. On average, a person has 25 passwords to remember. The most commonly used password worldwide is 123456. That means generally no security is given to a password. Biometrics is bringing certainty to security. However, there is still a large gap to fill in terms of awareness. People need to understand how good biometrics are. We also need to ensure the algorithms comply with rule and are open to regulations. We certainly see regulation as a positive.</p><h4>How do you approach your Latin American clients? Why do they partner with you?</h4><p>I would say that all start ups need to change the way they act from day one. We started by seeing people in IT departments of banks. We went to exhibitions and shows, too. I do a lot of conferences, which is a good way for us to demonstrate our product. IT people were interested in the technology. But they also have a lot of projects on the table, which means having to establish a long-term relationship. Then, we met with security people, who were interested in the technology. However, they also need to do their own job, with long-term priorities and bank strategies. We also met business people, who are in charge of growing the channel. The mobile app specialist has a target of going from 500,000 users to three million. And this is the person within the bank that we needed to approach to manage the project. Then, from a few cases of success, we were able to grow quite rapidly. We set goals for a smaller number of banks to help them with the integration and customer experience, even with social network messages to improve understanding. We help the banks in every aspect. We prefer to have 20 or 30 banks truly satisfied with the technology. When CaixaBank or HSBC show interest, then there are enough references to demonstrate the ease of implementation, the positive customer experience, and adoption rate.</p><h4>How do you maintain your algorithms in the rapidly evolving technology sector?</h4><p>We do this in two ways. One is the R&amp;D related to the algorithm for facial recognition. This requires a lot of continuous investment. Now there is huge demand for facial recognition that was not there three years ago. This requires the latest technology. On the other hand, there are the cases of success where banks want to see our portfolio of products. People are looking for more in biometrics; therefore, we have different alliances with fingerprinting, periocular technology, voice, and signature. A portfolio must continue to grow to maintain a leadership position. We do tailor-made solutions for clients depending on their scenario. For the case of CaixaBank, we rolled out technology with Fujitsu for ATMs. FacePhi, however, is really focused on the mobile channel.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main highlights over the last two years, and what is your strategy for 2020 and the pillars supporting this strategy?<br></strong>As a power company, our business model is straightforward, because we have a power purchase agreement (PPA) with OPWP. Al Kamil started in 2002, signed the PPA up to the end of 2017, and negotiated an extension up to the end of 2021 with OPWP. Starting from 2022, OPWP will launch a new way of tendering for another PPA. First, it did stage one in which it set a benchmark equal to the new player. If these companies accept that, they do not need to bring in a new player.</p><p><strong>How do you see the future of electricity market in Oman?<br></strong>In general, OPWP is stopping most new thermal plants and is instead looking to expand its involvement in renewables. The main target is to reduce gas consumption and boost efficiency. In September 2019, gas consumption was reduced by 9.4% YoY, though there was an increase in generation. This means Oman is pushing for the use of gas more for industry and reduce it in power plants. Oman is heading toward a spot or wholesale market, where generators and investors are exposed to more risks.</p><p><strong>How advanced is Oman regarding smart grid solutions?<br></strong>With the advent of renewables, smart grids are necessary because you need to quickly adjust to changes and keep the provision of power constant. Previously, there were only plants operated by fuel gas, which was easy to manually switch on and off; however, now with the mix of energy sources, it is complicated and has to be managed by AI. This means adopting fast calculations and responses, big data, and so forth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What stage is Oman currently at in terms of the power industry's privatization, and what will be the main implications of these efforts?<br></strong>As mandated by the government, Nama Holding has launched a partial privatization program, divided into five milestones, for Nama Group's electricity transmission, distribution, and supply companies by way of equity divestment to international strategic partners. We announced the sale of up to 49% of its shares in Oman Electricity Transmission Company (OETC) and the sale of up to 70% of its shares in its distribution and supply companies respectively: Muscat Electricity Distribution Company (MEDC), Majan Electricity Company, Mazoon Electricity Company, and Dhofar Power Company. For OETC and MEDC, this was done in October 2018. In December 2018, 23 companies expressed their interest in participating in OETC and MEDC privatizations, either individually or in consortia. As such, we appointed a consortium of advisors, led by Lazard Freres and London Economics, assisted by five other expert consulting firms, for this privatization program.</p><p><strong>What does the increase in smart meter penetration mean for Oman's broader power sector, and what will be the major impact on the commercial, industrial, and government accounts? </strong><br>Nama Group launched an automatic meter reading system (via the telecommunication network) for high-value and cost-reflective tariff (CRT) customers to record their readings on an hourly basis. This technology improved reading quality and tracking consumption per hour, helping costumers understand their consumption patterns, and enabled the implementation of the CRT. The project has been implemented successfully to completion and enables the reading of 50% of electricity consumption in the country via automatic means and on an hourly basis. The number of customers in this category represent only 1% customer penetration.</p><p><strong>How do you project the progress in energy storage solutions and the efficiency of solar panels to impact the power sector in Oman, and what opportunities are there for the private sector to engage with?</strong><br>The level of solar power density in Oman is considered among the highest in the world and can potentially meet the ever-growing demand for electricity in the country. Despite the abundance of solar energy, the storage mechanism is still not affordable. Nevertheless, if the storage technology evolved quickly on both the technical and economic fronts, and prices begin to fall, this will result in a radical shift in the overall power generation sector reducing dependency on conventional power plants. For this reason, a number of SMEs have shown great interest in the solar energy, as there are currently 15 qualified companies whose main business activity is rooftop solar panel installation. Tanweer's 11-site hybrid project includes storage system as a main component in the design, which was floated at the end of 2019, and we expect to reduce the electricity generation cost.</p><p><strong>How do you expect IoT and the advent of Industry 4.0 to innovate the utilities market in Oman and the region, and what will be the major regulatory challenges with the technological disruption?</strong><br>Studies show that new emerging technologies will significantly affect the current electricity market environment, structure, and requirements. These trends are most notably electrification, decentralization, and digitalization. As for electrification, emerging technology themes such as power-to-mobility have a substantial power requirement and might require capacity upgrades. With regard to decentralization, the increasing feasibility of decentralized energy solution will be prompted by the falling costs of energy storage systems and renewable energy system, coupled with flexible demand management models that reduce peak loads. Finally, digital networks including digital grids, smart meters, smart cities, sensors, and control systems will have a broader impact on the technological revolution.</p><p><strong>What are Nama Group's strategic priorities for 2020 with regards to water and wastewater restructuring? </strong><br>We continue to work closely with the Public Authority for Water to restructure the water sector, spearheading the execution of the 20-month long detailed design and implementation phase, which was initiated in April 2018 and is moving forward as planned. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the key to strike a balance between a top-down and bottom-up approach to reach the highest standards of environmental sustainability in rural locations in Oman?</strong><br>The Sultanate pays great attention to the environment and its protection from the adverse effects of pollution in order to preserve its components and sources. The Sultanate provides a unique example in the preservation and protection of the environment, as it has a prominent place at the regional and international levels for its distinguished achievements in conservation of environment and wildlife placing it among the ranks of developed countries. The deterioration of environmental, social, and economic conditions in rural areas leads to high rates of migration to urban areas, especially in middle-income and least developed countries. The quality of life in the countryside has declined in most Arab countries for various reasons, the most important of which is the focus in development programs on solving the problems and needs of urban areas while neglecting the allocation of sufficient resources for the development of rural areas. The Sultanate seeks to achieve balance in development in all regions, including rural and urban areas, and optimal exploitation and sustainability of natural resources in rural areas by the competent authorities. The key to achieving balance in these aspects is through integrating social aspects and community opinion in rural areas in the development of these areas, taking their recommendations in decision-making, and realizing the relationship between society and its environment.</p><p><strong>What are the main opportunities for the private sector to engage in addressing the challenges of desertification, land degradation, reduction in vegetation, drought, and loss of biodiversity?</strong><br>Addressing these above issues is not limited to government agencies alone; the private sector also has a major and significant role in this aspect through the management and mitigation of degraded land use activities, restoration of degraded lands, and making use of ecosystem services, in particular Oman's wild plants and trees, using an approach based on the sustainable use of natural resources and the conservation of the ecosystem by: providing clear guidelines for environmental management and land rehabilitation, especially around oilfields and mining areas; introducing community-based management of grazing at open spaces and exploiting non-timber forest products (such as frankincense and honey); investing and making use of mesquite (prosopis juliflora) by using their wood as firewood and for charcoal production; establishing nurseries to propagate wild plants and trees and encouraging people to plant them; and the national initiative to plant 10 million wild trees of Oman. Finally, private sector sewage companies shall provide water for projects concerned with combating desertification and land degradation in regions and sites located near sewage plants.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the country's path to divert waste by recycling and waste to energy projects?<br></strong>Reducing waste production from different economic activities and increased population growth is one of the challenges facing many countries around the world, but the government always seeks to enhance the participation of the private sector in providing various services and advancing the development process in all sectors, including the waste sector. Since Oman Environmental Service Holding Company S.A.O.C (be'ah) has been granted the mandate for waste sector management and operation in the Sultanate, the company, in coordination with the ministry and other relevant entities, establishes many facilities for receiving, treatment and final disposal of non-hazardous solid waste and health care waste in all regions of the Sultanate. Also, there are many investment projects provided for the private sector to invest in, such as construction and demolition waste recycling projects, used tires recycling projects, waste-into-energy projects, production of biogas from waste, and other projects. The steps the ministry is taking to strengthen inspection and control of industrial and service establishments to urge them to reduce waste production and encourage them to recycling and reuse processes will enable the country to go on right direction regarding waste management in the next stage. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

In 2020, we are focusing one of our global key strengths in warehouse and yard management, which means we will focus heavily as per SOLS2040 on mines and minerals to grow that industrial portfolio. We are looking to import and export raw materials such as marble, granite, and onyx for the construction sector. In Oman, most of our trade has been in retail and consumer. Almost 80% of 2019's revenue came from these areas. We are already moving marble from Africa to Oman or Oman to Asian countries. We are currently establishing warehouse businesses in Oman for consumer electronic goods and food. In the food sector, we work with many fishmeal and fish oil mass production factories that require chilling facilities. We will also develop further in automotive sector. We also have a big yard in Sohar at our disposal where we can store new and second-hand cars, providing a hub solution compared to Jebel Ali or Saudi.</p><p><strong>How will technology impact the logistics sector moving forward?<br></strong>Predominantly, Oman has been a trading hub. We are now able to provide key milestone visibility to customers on time each time. In the automotive industry, technology could help put cars in containers so that when an order is placed, the right number of cars are brought. The current method requires a great deal of handling. With the help of staggered deliveries, cash flow and finances will be eased. A lot of funds are locked into the current ordering system. Specifications are constantly changing as well, which can be problematic when buying in bulk. The other phase moving forward will be electronic shipping documents. Blockchain would be able to ease the current old legacy practices we are used to. The amount of time spent in moving these original documents between several stakeholders in a single transaction is costly and time consuming, reducing efficiency in supply chain and logistics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you expect the COVID-19 outbreak to impact Oman's logistics and warehousing industry in the medium term?<br></strong>The logistics and supply chain sectors have been severely affected in Oman due to the sudden drop in demand due to lockdowns and rigorous control of movement, especially at land borders and for air cargo. Air cargo is almost standstill. Sea shipments are still operational, but demand has fallen, and costs have started to rise. In the short term, the immediate and most evident effects are on the air transport, tourism, retail, and F&amp;B sectors. As one of the leading cold chain 3PLs in Oman we have many retail and food customers. Warehousing has not been immediately affected, though it remains to be seen which businesses will pull through and sustain through the crisis, and how this will affect the overall demand for warehousing. Logistics are grinding to a halt with disruptions in global supply chains and low activity in some of the world's major ports. We are hedging this risk by sustaining our business with some of the local projects and diverting our resources to those. We have also created internal COVID-19 management team headed by our COO to evaluate the risks and manage the operations with highest precautionary standards.</p><p><strong>How do you expect automation to impact the industrial supply chains in Oman, and what is your perspective on the future of warehousing?</strong><br>Automation implementation is slow in the region due to readily available manpower at a low cost. As these systems get cheaper and more robust, we expect to gradually see more automation in the 3PL business. If the current COVID-19 threat persists for longer than expected, robotics and automation could be a solution to reduce people's presence in close proximity. We would expect the automation would grow in the coming years not only because of labor cost, but businesses started to value the quality and cost-benefit of automation and system driven operations for better visibility and quality control. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How are you seeking to adjust to the growth of the Omani logistics sector?<br></strong>Oman, like the rest of the GCC countries, is working to diversify its economy. We see major investments in the non-hydrocarbon sector in general, and logistics specifically. Logistics sector in Oman is one of the key pillars of economic diversity with major government investments done towards its growth. Investments in road express networks, free zones, and ports target this vital sector's growth and regional competitiveness. As an industry leader, our focus in Oman for the next year will be on selected sectors and verticals such as e-commerce, healthcare, oil and gas, retail, banking and the industrial sector. Within this context, Aramex is investing in expanding its last-mile delivery fleet and ground operations including facilities and branch network, to cater to the surge in demand for its services and complement Oman Vision 2040.</p><p><strong>The e-commerce market is growing fast in Oman. What is the impact on Aramex operations and what role can technology play in this regard?</strong><br>The e-commerce industry is projected to witness a major growth in Oman, following a global trend and driven by a growing interest from Oman residents to shop online. Since Aramex is a leader in providing integrated solutions for e-commerce in the region and Oman, this growth affects us directly. To accommodate to the increasingly thriving e-commerce industry and to capture a major part of the e-commerce regional and global traffic, Aramex inaugurated a new operational facility in Muscat with in-house customs clearance solutions to enhance operational efficiencies and lower transit times. In addition, Aramex expanded its service center network to cover all major cities in Oman. Technology plays a major role in the overall operational efficiency and customer experience. Hence, Aramex has been investing in the latest technologies available in the industry to better service e-commerce customers, as well as transform itself into an innovative e-commerce solutions provider offering a revolutionary customer experience.</p><p><strong>What role can technology play in streamlining your back office and ensuring last-mile delivery meets the standards and expectations of your customers?</strong><br>Aramex is on an ongoing journey of digital transformation with a focus on enhancing the overall customer experience and further increasing our operational efficiencies. Organizational efficiency of our various departments is achieved through a number of digital investments and ERP enablement by the adoption of multiple digital tools. As for addressing the industry challenges in the last-mile delivery and in specific the growing customer expectation for e-commerce delivery, Aramex is investing in big data and machine learning that will improve delivery accuracy and solve the lack of proper physical addresses in the region by developing intelligent address prediction models through geo locations. Machine learning will also provide Aramex the ability to have accurate and instant delivery time predictions, using calculations based on seasonal volumes and capacity fluctuations. Aramex has upgraded its smartphone consumer app with multiple functionalities, including real-time map view with last-mile driver geo-tracking. We always aim to communicate with our customers through a cross-channel engagement tools to give them more power on controlling the delivery and pick-up time of their parcels at the nearest location. The upgraded app also offers our customers a safe pay tool with full payments breakdown, including customs charges.</p><p><strong>What do you think of the regulatory authority in Oman, and do you see any gaps for further improvement?</strong><br>TRA, Customs, and Royal Oman Police and Oman Aviation Group are all aligned in enhancing and improving the logistics sector in Oman. Processes, procedures and policies are developed and continuously evolve with emphasis on the growth and modernization of the logistics sector. Technology investments, be it customs systems and apps, have streamlined cargo and shipments movement, while in-house customs facilities have enhanced the integration with customs and increased the overall operational efficiency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the major trends shaping the Oman logistics sector, and how is the current macroeconomic environment impacting your business?<br></strong>All the macroeconomics of Oman have improved considerably since the decline in oil prices in 2016. Projects like Duqm refinery and developments in the oil and gas industry have enabled more production, spearheading the recovery of the sector that constitutes 70% of the country's GDP. While the retail sector has been slow to recover, in the logistics sector, Oman has become a trans-hub for all kinds of logistics services destined to GCC countries. The capacity and volume of both shipments and cargo has increased via air, sea, and road, facilitating the operations of free zones like Salalah and Sohar. In this context, we have been able to strengthen our operations, increasing capacity and enable transshipments. Customers can leverage our bonded facilities in the city and airport to minimize their cost in terms of double taxation and duties. The introduction of the VAT and the expansion of the e-commerce business will keep the retail sector suffering for a while, but the situation will improve in 2020 with the money that will be injected from the oil and gas sector. Indeed, oil and gas will be on a good steady growth for 2021, and the automotive sector will witness a similar boom.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations on the e-commerce segment in the short-term and why?<br></strong>We will continue serving the B2B market as it is one of our main segments. Moreover, we see a good expansion for us in the e-commerce sector next year. Although traditionally Oman has not had a large e-commerce sector, we forecast a good expansion over the next year and a real double-digit growth in the coming years. We have been working closely with the government to understand what is lacking in the current model and to convert Oman into an e-commerce hub to serve the GCC, East Africa, and North Africa. As such, we are leveraging Oman's simple customs clearing process, political stability, and geographical location to attract e-commerce businesses and SMEs. We are offering the necessary warehousing solutions and distribution centers, packaging facilities, and all the necessary requirements to achieve our goal. A major step in this direction will be the 15,000-sqm facility inside the airport, as well as the new DHL easy shop that will allow customers to shop anywhere in the US and other countries and get their shipment delivered within two days to their doorstep. Finally, we are signing major deals to upgrade our fleet and our network, in order for us to fully capitalize on the growth of the sector.</p><p><strong>Where else do you feel that technological upgrades and advantages will impact your business the most in the medium term?<br></strong>Today, technology is affecting every aspect of business and is on the fingertips of every customer. Our main goal is to simplify the customer experience with easy and accessible communication platforms. The next major stride will be on demand delivery. We are currently implementing an application that helps consumers to decide how, when, and where they would like their package to be delivered. Meanwhile, the B2B segment continues to witness an increase in integration between our systems and those of the counterpart, with all the data being stored. The integration is playing a big part for both businesses and consumers. It has the capability to have the systems communicate, impacting for example, customs clearance. At present, we are clearing 97% of our shipments before they even reach Oman. In the future, technology will further improve transport systems through robotics, innovations, and smart systems. In the near future, every shipment will be done through GPS delivery, and government regulations will be major enabler in this development. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have COVID-19 and the low oil prices impacted your business and the Omani shipping industry?<br></strong>On the one hand, COVID-19 has had a negative impact both on the container segment of our business, disrupting supply chains all around the world, and the dry bulk segment, forcing shipping companies to adjust. Nonetheless, after the first three weeks, trade links stabilized, and we were able to mitigate our losses. Since the beginning of 2020, OSC has transported more than 22,000 containers, linking Indian and Omani ports with Gulf ports. The VLCC sector has been overheated due to the low oil prices, although oil trading will drop if oil prices remain low. The market will thus slow down as soon as countries realize their stock has grows excessively, with refineries already lamenting a lack of demand for their products. Transportation prices will subsequently fall. In light of this scenario, the government remains focused on its goal of reducing dependence on petroleum products, hoping for other sectors to take over, such as mining, manufacturing, agriculture, and fisheries. This strategy will allow us to increase our market share of dry bulk in Oman.</p><p><strong>What does the integration of Oman Shipping Company under the ASYAD that mean for the company's business operations and the broader Omani logistics industry?</strong><br>Oman Drydock Company and Oman Shipping Company will remain two legally separate companies with two different P&amp;Ls. The integration was done firstly to reduce the overheads of both companies, both in terms of human capital and physical resources. Secondly, the integration was carried out to unlock 27 combined business development opportunities that the two companies can work together on, both in the short and long term. For example, Asset management becomes easier using integration. Moreover, ASYAD will be the common shareholder overseeing the financial condition of both companies. Around the world, such integration is fairly common. Partnerships are a key element of this strategy, especially with players that seek to grow in long-term relationships. We have identified opportunities for the container business to engage with local enterprises. At some point, we want to engage in mobile repair. We want to move closer to the supply chain to get closer to the source of industrial production. We want to work with traders and logistics across the value chain of a certain sector.</p><p><strong>As the global shipping industry continues with a wave of consolidation, how can Omani SMEs play a role in a “big fish" industry and maintain their international competitiveness?</strong><br>The integration of the Oman Shipping Company and Oman Drydock will unlock a wide array of opportunities for smaller players in different areas. Indeed, partnerships are a key element of our growth strategy, as we seek both to outsource non-core activities and engage in new avenues that could bring us financial and operational benefits. Any player who seeks to grow with us is welcome to be part of our strategy. In this sense, we have identified opportunities for local enterprises in the container business, mobile repair, and land logistics. We also want to move closer to the top of the supply chain at the source of the industrial production of a certain sector, in order to cooperate with companies involved along the value chain. Moreover, innovation is a key aspect that players in the shipping industry are looking at, and that does not necessarily stem from large companies. While in the medium term, the current trend of integration will continue, especially to mitigate the impact of the current crisis, in the longer-term partnerships will be created to unlock innovation and technological synergies. On a global level, partnerships will be impacted by the advent of regionalism, supported by the increasing populism affecting Western countries. Trade protectionism will determine how ports react, and shipping companies will have to adjust as more and more countries restrict free trade. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[launchpad-for-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the major highlights across the ports in your portfolio?<br></strong>In 2019, MARAFI made huge strides in its strategy of establishing small and medium ports for traders in the country. At Port Suwaiq, we handled around 500,000 tons of cargo, which comes mostly from Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, India, including building materials, metals, marble, and industrial chemicals. We target more imports of fruits and vegetables by having a direct link between the origin countries and Oman. Port Suwiaq will become a main satellite port in the north of Oman in the near future. At Port Sultan Qaboos, the number of cruises and passengers increased by 26%, and we seek to adjust to the growth in demand by building a new dedicated terminal for cruise ships. Moreover, we took over the operations of Port Shinas and Port of Khasab, controlling their proceedings, carrying out necessary initial infrastructure modifications and will also start developing dedicated terminals in 2020. The Port of Khasab has also undergone segmentation of the land that will be ready to offer to the market soon while the new cruise terminal will commence construction by mid-year 2020. At the end of 2019, we signed an agreement for the Khazaen Dry Port with two other local companies, which we hope will be ready to start soft operations by the end of 2020. As such, for 2020, our strategic priorities are to keep building our sound reputation, continue to expand commercially, and energize the communities around the ports, socially and economically. As we are achieving our rapid operational growth and stability, technology is becoming an added main tool for efficiencies improvements in the future.</p><p><strong>How should the public and private sector engage with regard to asset integration and value maximization opportunities in the logistics industry in Oman?</strong><br>Oman has great potential that could be exploited with proper organization and money management. MARAFI acts as a platform that the whole ecosystem could benefit from. This means even though we could build and operate the necessary infrastructure on our own, we engage with Omani companies to be with us, so we can develop it together for the long term. This is true for ports, dry ports, or port expansions, which will all be offered as PPPs to the private sector, allowing them to make meaningful contributions to national projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were some of the major highlights in 2019, and how are you working to increase the attractiveness of Salalah as a transport and logistics hub?<br></strong>2019 was one of the most exciting years in the history of the port. The year saw a journey of recovery from the devastating Cyclone Mekunu in 2018 and handling of an all-time record in both general cargo and the container terminal of the port. The general cargo terminal handled 16.27 million MT and the container terminal handled 4.1 million TEUs in the year. Despite significant overcapacity in the region, the port recovered all its volumes that were re-directed to other ports in the region after the cyclone in less than a year. This also demonstrates the confidence and the continued support that Port of Salalah enjoys from the government and its customers. In 2019, Port of Salalah has also committed to significant incremental capital expenditure as part of its asset replacement and capacity augmentation program. On the operating environment, the port also achieved numerous milestones in productivity and as part of its digital transformation and successfully deployed our terminal operating system (TOS), which forms the backbone of its container terminal operations. Also, all equipment purchased by the port have advanced features that not only allow for better synergy with the terminal operating system but also reduce the overall life cycle cost of the equipment and are environmentally friendly in terms of lower emissions and lower fuel consumption. Moreover, we also recently joined the TradeLens platform, which is a blockchain-enabled digital shipping platform, where nearly half of the world's ocean container cargo is available.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment on the logistic industry in Oman, and what role can Salalah play in enhancing its competitiveness?<br></strong>Logistics is a critical pillar of the economic diversification initiative of the Sultanate of Oman, and Port of Salalah is expected to play a crucial role in this diversification strategy. In this sense, the port is already working with other stakeholders of the Salalah hub such as Salalah Free Zone, Salalah Airport, Mazyunah Free Zone, and Madayn to attract and anchor a diverse range of industries that leverage the location, unparalleled connectivity of Salalah, and competitive cost. We also act as a corridor for neighboring countries for aid and relief while simultaneously providing businesses in North Oman with significantly faster transit times to their key markets. This also increases the overall competitiveness of Omani companies globally. We are working with key stakeholders to replicate the hub concept that has successfully transformed Salalah into a container transshipment hub to other industries that allow for wider market penetration and diversification using Salalah as their hub.</p><p><strong>How are you seeking to grow your general cargo and liquid cargo business?<br></strong>Limestone and gypsum have been historically drivers for volume growth in the general cargo terminal. We are now focused on improving the overall productivity for handling these volumes and providing a competitive edge to the mining companies in Salalah. Simultaneously, a number of concepts are being tested to facilitate further diversification of commodities and customers in the general cargo terminal. Liquid cargo is presently one of the smaller segments of the cargo portfolio of SPS and contributes to about 13% of the total volumes. We will soon start the development of a tank terminal in Salalah to facilitate growth of the liquid business, since we see a huge potential in this segment. There are a number of ongoing developments like the Salalah LPG project and ammonia project that will substantially increase the liquid footprint of Salalah. In addition, the Central Service Corridor for the pipe rack is expected to be operational by mid 2020. There has been great interest from a number of companies to set up tank facilities in the free zone and use the port as a gateway via the common pipe rack. We also see strong interest in offering bunkering at Salalah both by barges and by trucks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does Wujha play in the real estate market?<br></strong>Wujha is developing innovative housing solutions, mainly targeting Omanis. Our project is located in Muscat city center, which is one of the reasons why demand is growing every year. We target different types of customers, including those looking for housing investment, future investment, and money security. We offer diversification by location and types of housing. The real estate sector in Oman is based on two main aspects: prices and options. If you focus on both aspects of affordability and quality, you will be successful in the market. We also have an affiliation with banks in regard to client facilitation, using conventional and Islamic financing to suit a diverse client base. We want to take full lead of the sector, which is a tough objective. We will work on two aspects: build to sell and build to lease. In terms of strategy, the global market goes up and down, but sometimes you need to apply it to an isolated economy such as Oman, where you need to be able to provide the right solutions and products. The market will leave you behind unless you introduce new, innovative products, especially now with ICT disrupting the market.</p><p><strong>How is IT and technology impacting the real estate sector, and how are you incorporating it into your operations and products?<br></strong>We are an ERP-based company that connects the whole organization to one platform. This gives us unique and uniformed reporting methods, allowing us to make the right decision at the right time. On the other hand, technology is essential for facility management, but this depends on the resident association who will manage the building after we hand it over. Cultural readiness will drive technological advancement and innovation. In terms of infrastructure readiness, Oman is not ready. Even with the base there, people are not ready to pay for the service. This is why operators are reluctant to sell advanced services. Once the infrastructure is ready, the private sector will step in.</p><p><strong>What are the new trends that you are seeing in terms of lifestyle habits and customer requirements?<br></strong>Most people want to have a stylish, open space and white lighting with a modern design. For this, we use famous house designs from Spain and Italy. We have different suppliers for each segment of the design and we get our supplies from all over the world, including Italy, Turkey, Greece, India, China, and Indonesia. We cannot rely on local suppliers if we want to deliver international quality standards.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of Oman's real estate sector?<br></strong>The market is optimistic and demand for housing is growing hand-in-hand with population growth. Of course, the current market situation is being felt but not heavily, since demand is always there. Accommodation and housing in Muscat are always in demand, so we mainly focus where the economy is centralized. With the government cutting down on expenditure, contractors and suppliers have become skeptic; however, the downward trend is just a part of the classic real estate cycle. The market will correct itself as the real estate market in Oman is properly regulated. Obviously, it will not be easy for a company with no experience. The Omani market is not mature enough for us to consider mergers or consolidation as viable options.</p><p><strong>What are the main challenges real estate players face today in Oman?<br></strong>We do not have a central index of data where you can get the right information, so you must find it yourself by conducting surveys. Nobody knows when the rent should go up or down, which means you must wait six months until you realize there is an issue. By then, you lose time, effort, and money. We are ready to pay for an index service as it will help us develop better products. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the major trends in Oman's logistics and e-commerce market over the last year, and how are the future market prospects incorporated in your medium-term business strategy?<br></strong>In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, Oman Post has informed the Universal Postal Union (UPU) of the measures we have taken in this regard. First and foremost, we want to maintain a safe workplace and adopt best practices to protect and ensure the safety of our customers, employees and communities across Oman, while ensuring the continuity of our services. We implemented stricter processes and procedures that limits customer walk-ins to all branches to appointments only. This step has been taken to eliminate customer interactions and support social/physical distancing. We realize the important role of postal services and will continue to be operational with only essential staff remaining on-site, while all other staff will work from home. During this time, we are offering customers key services to avoid interruptions. Customers will be able to visit one of our branches to collect or receive items by booking an appointment. Drop-off or pick-up procedures at branches all adhere to social distancing procedures. Mailbox contents and parcels can be delivered to customers' physical addressees through our latest door-to-door service, Asyad Express. Additionally, our online shopping delivery service Matjar from the US remain operational via <a href="http://www.matjar.om">www.matjar.om</a>. Oman Post will continue to follow the directives and measures of the local and international bodies.</p><p><strong>How do you expect demand across your services and client base to evolve in the medium term, and what will be the main factors and trend determining this evolution?</strong><br>The industry has undergone a fundamental evolution over recent years that have been driven by technological advancements. This has resulted in a number of organizations including Oman Post reinventing themselves and moving into retail digitalization. We are growing our Express Mail Service business, creating more value for our increasing customer base. That's why we have made significant investments in technology to improve service performance as well as introducing new features to enhance our EMS service. The transformation of our EMS services is part of Oman Post's robust development strategy, Driving Transformation through Business Excellence, which is in line with the national logistics strategy to position the Sultanate as a leading trade and logistics hub. Focusing on optimizing core mail operations, enhancing our logistics network and international growth, this strategy also enables the goals set out in the EMS Cooperative's Business Plan. To meet the evolving needs of today's e-commerce customers, we have implemented a number of improvements including additional types of delivery such as home delivery and pick-up points through our recently launched door-to-door service Asyad Express, and new online features enabling customers to create orders for mail collection and delivery through the website. Another service available to customers looking to send letters or parcels to their friends and family across 220 destinations globally is the International Premium Express Mail (IPEX), which offers quality, convenience coupled with competitive prices. To remain competitive, we have centered our efforts on cost control, operations optimization, innovation, investing in logistics and expanding international networks, broadening financial services, and enhancing retail networks.</p><p><strong>Where and how do you expect technological advancement to have the greatest impact on the logistics and postal industry, and what will be the main implications for both the supply and demand side in the market? </strong><br>Leading-edge technology will form the foundation of our transformation, resulting in better counter-solutions, back-end solutions, and last-mile delivery solutions. While our current network comprises 83 branches across the Sultanate, we are looking at how we can enhance offering other products and services outside the traditional postal model. Oman Post is also diversifying its portfolio to include a broad range of services such as e-commerce. The Matjar online address forwarding platform allows customers to establish a virtual address in the US and other countries at competitive prices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What methods did the company use to finally break its production benchmark of 1 million tons of copper in 2019 for the first time?</h4><p>There will always be potential for mining growth in Mexico, Peru, and the US. We have seven open-pit mines: two in Mexico, two in Peru, and three in Arizona. Our production in 2019 was, for the first time, over 1 million tons of copper; due to the completed expansion of the second concentrator in Toquepala. This added expansion allowed us to increase our production by 100,000 tons; leading to a grand total of over 1 million tons.</p><h4>What are your expectations for production in 2020?</h4><p>We have about the same expectations. We have three investments in Mexico, one of those will be Buenavista Zinc, we found zinc inside copper, this material needs to be process in a new concentrator. That will increase production and total income in our underground mines in Mexico. The construction of the new concentrator is due to start this year and is expected to be completed in two years with an investment of approximately USD480 million.</p><h4>Are you still contemplating entering new markets such as Ecuador, Argentina, and Chile?</h4><p>We are exploring market opportunities on the mining sector in other three countries. We are currently exploring the opportunity of evolving us into a project in Ecuador for a copper mine. We have not taken a final decision; however, we need to evaluate the long term benefits this important investment can add up to our company. At the moment, we are exploring possibilities, that can prove it will be a substantial project. </p><h4>How will COVID-19 impact your production and performance in 2020?</h4><p>We cannot deny the fact; this global pandemic is affecting our sector, but Americas Mining Corporation is in the other hand, already sold 80-85% of our production to Chinese companies in October 2019. The only inconvenience we have encountered is the change of distribution dates because some companies are suggesting that we do not send it according to the timing we had already set up. Apart from that, it has not been a problem, since we already signed the contracts. We will send our production following a different timing than we expected, and we hope it will not cause any further problems.</p><h4>What does the mining industry in Mexico need to become more competitive?</h4><p>We consider Mexico already competitive. We are achieving higher production levels in Mexico compared to Peru, mainly in Buenavista del Cobre. Moreover, due to the addition of a new concentrator, we were able to increase our production by more than 100,000 tons of copper. This addition helped us achieve over 1 million tons we produced in 2019. Out of our total production, 60% comes from Mexico, and 40% comes from Peru. Nevertheless, we have three pending projects in Peru: Tí­a Marí­a, Los Chancas, and Michiquillay. They have different dates. In Mexico, we have the Buenavista mine, which is centered in zinc extraction. Furthermore, we have an upcoming small mine project, El Pilar, in Mexico, which is expected to produce 30,000 tons of copper. El Pilar project will start in 2020 and will take at least 1.5 years to produce the amount of copper we expect.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the highlights of 2019, and how do they reflect the major trends in Oman's real estate sector?<br></strong>In 2019, Muriya's total investments reached USD750 million. Our two destinations, namely Hawana Salalah and Jebel Sifah, feature a number of four- and five-star hotels, with a total capacity of 1,200. We recently expanded the Fanar Hotel &amp; Residences in Hawana Salalah, adding 177 rooms. On the real estate front, in 2019 we delivered 600 units ahead of schedule. Additionally, in Jebel Sifah we launched 230 freehold beachfront properties. Jebel Sifah is fast growing as a second-home and weekend retreat, yet more and more people are deciding to live there and commute to Muscat. The government has been investing in infrastructure, and it is only a matter of time before Jebel Sifah will become an integral part of the city. In Hawana Salalah, we launched 235 units in 2019 as part of the Forest Island project, which we started in 2018. Its construction is underway and set for on-time delivery in 2020. We have noticed that an increasing number of tourists who repeatedly visit Hawana Salalah end up buying properties there. Such examples of FDI will undoubtedly have a positive, trickle-down effect on the economy. Such investors will visit Oman more regularly and also bring more tourists to the country. We are currently working on developing more hotels in Salalah. These developments reflect our commitment to the growth of Oman's tourism segment. Oman is becoming more well known internationally, especially in the high-end tourist market, which will remain the main target of Salalah since the rates are higher compared to other destinations in the region.</p><p><strong>Looking at your current model, what aspects require extra focus and efforts to contribute to the overall development of the Omani economy? </strong><br>Our projects are of a long-term nature; therefore, we have to continuously invest and develop to entice residents and tourists. Eventually, these destinations become small tourist towns, opening up increasing opportunities for SMEs to provide goods and services, such as transportation, sightseeing trips, locally grown fruit and vegetables, and construction materials. Hawana Salalah boasts several such examples, most notably a Dhofari SME that started off with one fishing boat. In a span of five years, the SME has grown to eight boats and 50 employees. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the luxury real estate sector perform in the last few years? <br></strong>Oman's luxury sector did not experience a major dip in the last few years. People are still staying in five-star hotels and buying luxury products. The developments in the past few years pushed companies producing luxury products to innovate. The luxury segment is about experiences as much as the product. At Barr Al Jissah, we have outperformed the rest of the market and sold a number of units in the Al Mina development. We have noticed that instead of small units, clients are going for larger units, which is interesting. All of our units are tailored to the client's needs and that helps us find buyers.</p><p><strong>What are your prospects for 2020 now that the economy is set to grow by 3.7%? <br></strong>There is still confidence in the economy as evident from the number of people from abroad showing their interest in Oman's real estate market. People are confident that Oman is the right place to invest. January 2020 outperformed January 2019 so data is also backing this trend. Nonetheless, the current project we are working on will be our last project in Oman because otherwise our projects will lose their exclusive appeal. For a company such as ours, it is important to maintain the same level of serenity, services, and exclusivity. Another factor is that we are competing with all the GCC countries; therefore, we have to maintain our exclusivity.</p><p><strong>What are the keys to maintaining the image of exclusivity in the luxury segment?<br></strong>We offer complete home automation and a concierge services app. For example, using the app, clients can use our service to fill their fridges with supplies when they are not home. The app also enables our clients to check their utility bills and control home appliances. We are trying to be as environmentally friendly as possible. We put a lot of focus on sustainability. We want to start focusing more on healthy living. We want people to be able to walk around, so we are creating walking tracks and running tracks. Moving forward, we will add more facilities to the marina, such as snorkeling and places to sunbathe. The overall experience is the key to maintaining the image of exclusivity.</p><p><strong>What are the prospects of Omani luxury real estate developers tapping into other markets? <br></strong>It is too early for Oman because most of the developers in are still trying to establish their names. I don't see the majority of them expanding into other markets in the near future. There is still a lot of development that can be done in Oman. What developers in Oman need to do is take advantage of Oman's natural beauty and diversity.</p><p><strong>How have logistical improvements supported Oman's real estate industry? <br></strong>We have been buying all the materials from Italy for more than two years and it has improved our position and given us a different angle or edge compared to our competitors. Since we are buying in large volumes, we can make it work for us and the clients. Italian companies usually ship to the Sohar Port, from where we can easily transport the goods by trucks. Oman's robust infrastructure has indeed helped us immensely. What is more, continuous improvements are being made to existing infrastructure.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020? <br></strong>Our primary objective is to finish the project we are working on, and we are on track. The biggest challenge we are facing is that we do not want to compete solely on price. Some developers choose to drop prices to sell more, but we do not do that. We are not in a hurry to sell because our projects are unique. We offer limited-edition units with unique values and views. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you expect the outbreak of COVID-19 to impact the Omani business environment in the medium term?<br></strong>The pandemic and the decline in oil prices will affect the Omani and global economy for years to come. Thus, we have to cut down expenses where appropriate, and concentrate on the divisions that have the greatest possibility of maintaining a positive income flow. We remain optimistic for a faster recovery, but we are also careful with investing in areas that may lag in terms of recovery.</p><p><strong>What lasting changes will the current macroeconomic environment and COVID-19 have on the Omani real estate sector? </strong><br>The Omani real estate market has been hit by two factors. First, by the reduction in income for many and second, by the departure of numerous middle- to high-level expats. Therefore, there is no doubt that margins will be negatively affected. The key to controlling the negative effect on margins will be retaining long-term residents and managing maintenance budget without degrading property. The rental sector will benefit from the young generation of Omanis who will marry and live outside their parents' home at a younger age.</p><p><strong>How is the evolution of the community living concept reflected in the adjustments Yahya Group has undertaken at Dolphin Village?</strong><br>Dolphin Village always has been a multi-cultural community. Originally, the predominant nationality was British, as the Dolphin Village was the staff camp for the Yahya-Costain Construction Company, which had roots in the UK and Oman. Once the village became a commercial enterprise, the number of nationalities grew and today we have residents from six continents. I believe our definition of community is summed up in our motto 'it's where you belong'. I can see we have a strong community when I see our residents help each other and come together to help others.</p><p><strong>How do you expect requirements for real estate players to evolve and adjust to the evolution in demand for their assets?</strong><br>With the reduction of expats in Oman, the initial result will be downward pressure on rental rates. High-end properties, such as Dolphin Village, will be able to maintain their rates better than others as they offer more extensive facilities that no other community offers. Due to the Village's amenities, people consider Dolphin Village a residential resort. New projects will have to contemplate how they will offer their tenants more than just a home to live-in, with lifestyle comforts becoming the main asset to attract the best clients.</p><p><strong>How is digitalization impacting the management of residential assets in Oman?</strong><br>There is no doubt that new technologies and programs will help managers of real estate in countless ways. One area is the ability to quickly target problem areas and track the repair expense versus replacement costs. With better technology and communication, the experience of residents will improve. Since Dolphin Village is a multicultural community, there are sometimes language barriers when requesting services or asking questions, but these barriers will be overcome through technology. Through technology, we will be able to understand our residents' needs better and satisfy their demands more efficiently. This will also help residents get a clearer picture of what to expect from us. Technology will also assist us in accomplishing our goal of achieving high satisfaction rates and retain a good clientele. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your definition of innovative communities? <br></strong>Innovative communities are the ones that are successful in bringing creative ideas and latest technologies and design to elevate the customer journey. It is always imperative for us as a business to continuously invest in enabling innovative solutions to further enhance the wellbeing of our customers and their experience. At Al Mouj Muscat, we regularly map our customers' journeys to examine new opportunities and introduce innovative solutions. This process starts from marketing and lead generation, by utilizing latest data analytics tools to push our products to the preferred channels and to make their search experience easy. During the purchasing process, our customers can use VR and 3D solutions to preview the development and select a property. We adopt ERP solutions to cut down processing times. When talking about innovation in the real estate industry, we immediately think of smart homes which provide the best infrastructure and world-class connectivity, offering full flexibility to customers to plug-in IoT technology gadgets. We provide smart security solutions such as facial recognition, digital meters for district cooling consumption, smart LED lights, and smart irrigation solutions. Innovation is a wider concept that is applicable to the entire business model. At Al Mouj Muscat, we are adopting a place-making concept, which is a soft concept of innovation to fulfill the diverse needs of our community. These types of innovative concepts enable us to build a place where people feel at home and enjoy great moments every day.</p><p><strong>What is the best strategy to adopt in the field of mobility and transportation? <br></strong>As part of our place-making approach, we have a well-planned community that boasts shared urban spaces, which are human in scale and not car-centric. We also have dedicated lanes for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as exclusive stations for public transportation. By doing so, we enhance the safety of pedestrians and promote a healthy lifestyle. Recently, we introduced co-sharing mobility solutions to transport tourists and visitors within Al Mouj Muscat. Available on an on-demand basis, mobility solutions can now be accessed through several different service providers. Moreover, we are currently planning the development of a dedicated on-demand mobility application that will connect the various destinations within Al Mouj Muscat; the app will also include a driverless vehicle facility for the delivery of goods from supermarkets and restaurants to our residents.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the Integrated Tourism Complex (ITC) concept to evolve in Muscat? <br></strong>Al Mouj Muscat is a premier ITC. We have developed high-quality assets, attracting both local and international visitors. This includes Al Mouj Golf, Al Mouj Marina, and seven hotels. Notably, the development will create 5,500 permanent jobs upon completion. Al Mouj Muscat is becoming the new home for the youth, which in turn also supports the growth and presence of local brands. We look at offering better investment opportunities for both upcoming and established entrepreneurs and start-ups. These are just a few highlights of the impact of Al Mouj. Not every area in Muscat will need an ITC, but the use of development principles would be beneficial. For example, the government is using the PPP model to build affordable mix-use developments. This will improve the city's capacity to operate effectively.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020?<br></strong>In 2019, we grew by 53% in a tough real estate market. We successfully achieved this by firstly building stronger networks within Oman, leveraging the nature of our ITC, and attracting FDI. Our goal to fast track each project by initiating collaboration with sub-developers. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the highlights for ORIS in 2019 and your growth expectations for 2020?<br></strong>Omnivest is one of the biggest investment companies in the region, and its operations revolve around its six strategic platforms. These include banking, insurance, leasing, real estate, investment banking, and financial investments. ORIS is the real estate investment and development arm of Ominvest. We have grown steadly since our inception; starting out with a capital of OMR1 million in 2016, we are now at OMR15 million, continually building our brand and cementing our place in the industry. The key factor behind our success has been quality at the right price. It is what assisted us in the construction of the iconic Omnivest Business Center. When we started the business center in 2015, there was an surplus of office space, yet nothing to the standard we knew our target tenant would be looking for; thus we went forward with our project and are now at 90% occupation, with some of the largest names in the country as tenants as well as various VIPs. Our aim is to recreate the same results in all our other projects. We see that there is still a demand for high-quality projects and our focus is to tap into that demand. As for the future, we are currently working on major development projects that are collectively worth more than OMR100 million.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the short-term trends shaping the local construction market? <br></strong>The real estate sector has been impacted by the current economic climate; however, despite this uncertainty, the real estate market has been registering healthy growth. There were and are concerns about the impact of the ban on visas and other regulations put in place; however, the implementation of the national tourism strategy will drive growth in real estate. In the current scenario, the best approach is a conservative one. For example, one of our projects includes six buildings that we had planned to tender for at the same time, but due to new trends we have decided to phase it over a longer period. Another noticeable trend currently is that developers and landowners are bringing in multiple partners to reduce the overall risk. An important point to broach is the emergence of COVID-19; we can already see the impact globally across different sectors, including real estate. We have seen the effect of China's closure on our ongoing construction and in the coming few months we will see significant delay in project completion due to precautionary measures and slow movement of freight due to lockdowns. However, we need to keep moving forward. If there is no growth in the sector, it will adversely affect the economy. So there needs to be some development to support our country. Additionally, we will see the impact of COVID-19 on end users. Their demands and tastes will shift. So, as developers, we need to think about how we can address these changes through innovation.</p><p><strong>Is the government moving in the right direction to assist the construction sector?<br></strong>The only area where we have seen real development is Duqm. The government provided land and support to private-sector players, and we are now seeing development. Several free zones are also being developed, but other than that the progress has been slow. Simply put, the government needs to be more flexible and reflect the mentality of the private sector.</p><p><strong>What role can digitalization and new technologies play?<br></strong>Ideally, there should be a single portal for all approvals. I believe it is crucial to streamline bureaucratic processes. People in Oman have started talking about sustainable building techniques and LEED design principles. These require approval from regulators, and although getting approvals for new technologies and methods will slow things down slightly, we should not back down because sustainability is the way forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Bigger, bolder, and better]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bigger-bolder-and-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main drivers behind the creation of NUST?<br></strong>Higher education is one of the key elements for a stable and prosperous society. The three colleges that merged to form the NUST date back to the mid-1990s and have a long track record of delivering education that fits Oman. The first driver behind the merger was the rise of interdisciplinary teaching, while the second was the reduction in the high fixed costs of each university. In 2019, we witnessed double-digit growth in terms of the number of students, 80% of which are Omanis. The strategy of the school can be summed up in three words: bigger, bolder, and better. We will keep growing and venture into areas not touched by higher education in Oman, and we will improve the quality of online learning.</p><p><strong>What are the most effective teaching practices in digitally blended education environments?<br></strong>The outbreak of COVID-19 will lead to a different era once the pandemic is contained and managed. Suddenly, everyone had to move to online learning overnight, and it is hard to see a return from this. While elements of e-learning have always been there, in the future, it will not be seen any more as a substitute, but rather a different way of learning; universities that adapt fast to this process will be successful. The human element is also bound to play a different role, since education has not changed to a large extent in the past 200 years. Today, there is no reason to be in the same place at the same time to get factual information, which can be acquired online everywhere. The teacher adds value by teaching students how to absorb and utilize information. Academic faculty is thus moving away from being experts to becoming coaches.</p><p><strong>How will the growth of the entrepreneurial culture impact Oman's higher education system?<br></strong>Aside from funding and developing a risk-taking culture, universities can contribute by incorporating entrepreneurial studies in their programs, such as NUST, and by offering facilities which entrepreneurs can use to develop and launch their ideas. The growth of entrepreneurship requires a fundamental change in the way higher education is structured. Historically, higher education has been used to train people to get jobs; now, it needs to teach people how to create jobs. Recent statistics for the US and UK show that in the last 10 years most of the jobs have been created by the SME segment. Oman has all the elements to develop the same pattern as these two advanced economies. The Sultanate has a trading culture, a young population, and a government that is committed to the future. The younger generation, with the support of technology, will take up the challenge, whether by spurring innovation or by helping existing industries.</p><p><strong>What is the key to bridge the gap between the developments in R&amp;D and the commercialization of those developments?<br></strong>In terms of research, efforts should be made to address direct social and economic needs of the country. Fundamental research carried out by universities in more advanced economies is too long term, especially given the pressing challenges that need to be solved in emerging countries such as Oman. The relationship between fundamental and applied is not always as linear and direct, just like the one from innovation to exploitation. It also produces an ecosystem of skilled and knowledgeable people who can develop their own field of research ancillary to the core program. Since more than 75% of our student body is local, and the stakeholders we engaged with are Omanis, it makes sense to focus on national problems; however, Oman shares many of its issues with other countries in the region, so it would be natural, at a later stage, to apply a solution across borders, whether it is in the health or engineering field. Relevance is at the core of any research efforts, and adopting a national focus is crucial to ensure that the relevance element is met. </p>]]></richbody0content>

There are no public golf courses in the country except for those in tourist areas in Puerto Los Cabos, Cancún. Inside Mexico City, and the rest of the country, we only have private clubs. In the US, there are about 26,000 golf courses, while in Mexico, we have around 300. Similarly, in the US, there are about 40 million golfers. In Mexico, we have about 300,000 golfers. We saw this opportunity and decided to open Amanali Country Club &amp; Náutica. We also have a lake, so I usually call Amanali the new Valle del Bravo. Our market is basically Mexico City. Around 70% of our customers are from Mexico City, and we are only one hour away from it. At present, we have about 240 homes and eventually we will have 2,000 homes. We do not sell shares of our club but we offer memberships. So far, we have 400 memberships. Our maximum capacity is 700. Eventually, we will have space for 1,500 members. People started building houses here about five years ago, and we are currently building another 200 homes. We only use Mexican contemporary style in order to keep the same design throughout the golf course. A yearly membership costs USD12,000. </p><h4>When will the second phase of the country club be completed?</h4><p>€¨We just started working on phase two. During the first one, we sold 1,000 lots in seven years. In the beginning, 1sqm cost USD75 and now it is around USD350. A house in Amanali costs USD500,000, and the annual maintenance fee is about USD40,000. This is of course a long- term investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your strategy for 2020 and the medium term?<br></strong>We are currently working on the National Research Strategy 2020-2040, which builds on the National Research Strategy 2008-2020. It is fully aligned with Oman's Vision 2040. The current strategy focuses on conducting valuable and impactful research and establishing links with industry, especially in the downstream segment of the technology readiness level (TRL). At the same time, we continue to fund ongoing programs, with 266 projects funded annually through the Block Funding Program for researchers. Oman's ninth five-year plan focuses on manufacturing, fisheries, logistics, tourism, and mining; therefore, researchers tend to link their proposals to these focus areas in order to maximize the relevance component, while maintaining the required scientific excellence in their proposals. Furthermore, researchers can also submit proposals in other fields that will contribute to the advancement of knowledge locally and internationally.</p><p><strong>How do you strike a balance between fundamental research and applying and solving issues?<br></strong>The Block Funding program is geared more toward fundamental research as per its requirement for investigator-driven ideas; however, we have another program called the Strategic Directive Program, which is mainly for applied research. Around the world, 20% of the research and the associate funding is fundamental in nature, and 80% is applied. The two are, however, interlinked and drive each other, in collaboration with the relevant stakeholders.</p><p><strong>What is the key to attracting more Omanis into the field of research?<br></strong>With less than 300 researchers per million inhabitants, Oman is lacking capacity. We are trying to build that capacity by mandating research and academic institutions that gain funding from our programs to involve and train Omanis. We want researchers to collaborate and build national research capacity. As part of our active research programs, we have funded more than 97 PhD scholarships and 170 master's degree scholarships over the past nine years and trained hundreds of bachelor students to be research assistants. Additionally, we have a program titled the Faculty Mentored Undergraduate Research Award Program (FURAP) for undergraduate students to submit their competitive research proposals where they can receive up to OMR1,000 in research funding. We fund more than 200 FURAP projects every year.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about your program for undergraduate students?<br></strong>We have a program to build final-year projects into businesses. If we select 1% of these undergraduate projects carefully and guide them through an incubation process, we believe they will be able to establish successful companies. Currently, we have nine such companies in the pipeline, and some of them already have contracts with public- and private-sector players in the ICT industry. We are inserting another stream in logistics and will soon expand to fisheries, mining, and other important sectors. We also have the national research award program to recognize researchers who publish their research work in top-notch scientific journals. We also select young active researchers to attend the Lindau Nobel Laureate Award meetings.</p><p><strong>What are the prospects for regional integration with other academic organizations?<br></strong>We have the Masader program, a virtual library with cutting-edge publications. We hope to combine Masader with the Oman Research and Education Network (OMREN), a connectivity platform operating between the private sector and the Research Council. The collaboration in the Gulf is happening between Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Oman, which is great as there are several supercomputers in in the region which our researchers can utilize.</p><p><strong>What are your three main priorities for 2020?<br></strong>The current priority is to make sure that the National Research Strategy 2020-2040 is fully aligned with Oman's Vision 2040. Another priority is capturing the value from previous and ongoing research. The third main priority for 2020 is to strengthen our industrial sector, which is why we created the Ejad platform to establish links between academia and industry. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How does OAAA ensure that higher education institutions (HEI) meet international benchmarks, and to what extent do you collaborate with foreign partners to do so?</strong><br>OAAA's three main activities cover HEI accreditation, program accreditation, and the updating and maintaining of the Oman Qualifications Framework. Institutional accreditation involves assessing HEIs against national standards that have been developed through benchmarking standards and processes, regionally and internationally, with those of over 40 quality assurance agencies. Extensive consultation took place with international consultants, either through feedback on draft standards, or through the contribution of keynote speakers in the symposium OAAA held to consult on standards. These standards have also been revised through extensive consultation with the local higher education sector to ensure that they are suitably contextualized for Oman. International collaboration continues to inform our work at OAAA with at least 60% of each of our review panels generally consisting of regional and international external reviewers. A similar approach in terms of harnessing international collaboration has been employed for the development of standards for program accreditation, and we have worked with the Scottish Qualifications Authority to develop the comprehensive Oman Qualifications Framework covering all types and levels of education.</p><p><strong>How do you expect Omani HEIs to remain ahead of the curve regarding the world of work?<br></strong>It is the responsibility of the higher education sector to monitor market needs, and we ensure, through our review activities, that HEIs remain in continuous collaboration with industry. This is important so that programs are developed by HEIs that are relevant to the current and future needs of industry and that these programs are periodically reviewed to ascertain their suitability for meeting the rapidly changing needs of the labor market. Each new program requires a feasibility study that is designed to check that it embraces national priorities as reflected through Vision 2040. While the Ministry of Higher Education is responsible for licensing these new programs, OAAA plays a role in ensuring that HEIs remain current and relevant in their provision. A number of the criteria of our accreditation standards reflect the onus on HEIs to maintain a healthy relationship with the industries and stakeholders they serve, with only those HEIs meeting all standards being accredited.</p><p><strong>How do you project the provision of academic learning and vocational training by private and public sectors to evolve in the future, and what role do you expect each side to play?</strong><br>OAAA supports the growing emphasis on vocational training through the listing of vocational and professional qualifications on the Oman Qualifications Framework; this allows for a productive articulation from one pathway to another, complementing the contemporary need for lifelong learning and flexible career patterns. The private higher education sector has a role to play in broadening the opportunities for individuals to develop their skills in all areas of learning. Approximately 50% of HE students are currently studying in the private sector, and the government encourages this through a generous sponsorship program. OAAA supports the diversification of the economy by ensuring that these private institutions are fit for purpose, and that they deliver a sound return on the national investment in HE. This is accomplished through delivering a strong graduate output that, in turn, contributes effectively to the sustainable further development of the country.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities for 2020, and what factors are driving them?<br></strong>OAAA has many priorities for the future, focusing on each of the three core areas of our work. In Institutional Accreditation, our priority is to continue working on this second stage of the process to ensure that all HEIs currently scheduled for accreditation undergo standards assessment on time. In terms of program accreditation, our priority is to finalize the newly-developed standards for implementation; to this end, pilot program standards assessments (PSA) will take place in selected accredited HEIs at the end of 2020 with expected commencement of officially launched PSA in 2021. Our other notable project currently under development is the Oman Qualifications Framework. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you assess the contribution of the private higher education sector in supporting the labor market with skilled workforce?</strong><br>When the government decided to call on the private sector to assist in preparing the Omani youth for the labor market, a set of specific standards, procedures and guidelines on quality assurance were developed. Academic affiliations with overseas higher education institutions (HEIs) with internationally experienced staff and that have internationally recognized standards is one strategy that allows local institutions to learn from one another and exchange best practices with the partner institution. The government has also established the Oman Academic Accreditation Authority (OAAA) to ensure that the delivery of higher education by the local institutions is on par with international benchmarks. With regard to the employability of graduates from private HEIs compared to the employability of their peers who graduated from the public institutions, the outcomes of the graduate surveys regularly conducted by the Ministry of Higher Education show that the graduates from private HEIs account for around 64% of the employed graduates in 2019. The private higher education sector is facing a number of challenges that—if not addressed—will threaten its sustainability. Private institutions continue to heavily rely on government-funded scholarship students and have not been successful enough in attracting international students. They must increase their competencies to comply with the national, regional, and international standards to be able to sustain in such a dynamic and ever-changing market.</p><p><strong>What is the best strategy to ensure Omanis are equipped with transferable skills to adopt to the evolving nature of today's job market?</strong><br>The Ministry of Higher Education is aware that there is an urgent need to address the impact of new technologies on labor markets through upgraded education policies that aim to rapidly raise the education and skill levels of people of all ages. The higher education system must employ agile and flexible methods in view of program delivery, program design, and training that needs be responsive to varying employer needs. Other relevant intervention points include curricula, staff training, and a reinvention of vocational training to prepare for Industry 4.0, while broadening its appeal beyond the traditional low- and medium-skilled occupations at the same time. It is also important to promote collaboration and dialogue among all stakeholders. There are many stakeholders with an influence on education including local employers and government policymakers, business groups, and training providers. In addition, improvements in education and skills provision must be balanced with efforts to be made on the demand side. This means there is a need for accurate and updated information about the labor market needs in view of all types of skills in order for the education system can respond by equipping students with these required skills.</p><p><strong>Where do you expect technology to impact the higher education system the most in Oman?<br></strong>The strategic direction of Oman Vision 2040 has been carefully designed to ensure the educational system leverages human capabilities, as this is a necessary prerequisite for the development of a knowledge society and adaptable national talent with the ability to compete in the labor market. The National Strategy for Education 2040 outlines the guidelines and an action plan to achieve these objectives. It calls for improving the information technology infrastructure and for support of the use of cutting-edge technology, e-learning, and capacity building in our educational institutions. The educational developments in Oman witnessed system- and structural-wide changes, including a complete review of the curriculum, leading to a more practice-based curriculum attuned to the needs of the workplace, and pedagogical approaches and improving learning and teaching methods that encourages innovative thinking. The government has provided all the support needed by HEIs to provide an educational environment that encourages learning by practice and ensures that innovation is at the heart of their learning outcomes. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Given the intense competition in Oman's highly price sensitive market, what is your strategy to further grow your market share in the medium term?<br></strong>Today, we face a new demographic reality, as in the past few years a number of expats have left the country. This subsequently had a negative impact on consumption levels in Oman. Moreover, the economy is witnessing a cashflow issue, which led to a rise in bounced checks and the closing down of a number of retail shops. Despite these challenges, our business has seen significant changes mostly because of the introduction of the excise tax on carbonated soft drinks in June 2019 and further expansion of other sweetened beverages projected in 2020. Potentially, the VAT represents another challenge that can affect our margins, so we have to adjust accordingly. So far, we have sought to respond swiftly by offering a variety of sizes providing different price points that cater to all socio-economic categories of consumers in the Sultanate. In order to grow our brand preference in the country, we have initiated several marketing initiatives including new launches that offer superior brands in terms of taste, positioning, and packaging.</p><p><strong>How do you expect demand across your lines to evolve in the medium term, and what market factors will be responsible for this evolution in the consumer-packaged goods (CPG) business?</strong><br>Today, we maintain a large presence across the Sultanate, especially in the carbonated soft drinks segment, of which we have an 86% market share. Growth in health awareness and consciousness trends is an inevitable trend, which is why have to monitor market trends and respond in an appropriate manner. We have introduced different products that provide less sugar, fewer calories, natural ingredients, and no sugar added formulas. These products have gained momentum and helped us gain more consumers in Oman.</p><p><strong>How is technology impacting your business model the most, and where do you expect technological advancements to have the deepest impact on the nature of the Omani F&amp;B industry?</strong><br>Technology and innovation are impacting the entire manufacturing industry in different ways. For example, it has become a necessity to move to real-time data, connectivity, and traceability. Although we are not into predictive analytics, we are trying to control the entire process, from procurement to consumer. In this regard, we partnered with Salesforce. For consumers, access to continuous information that some time is not reliable can cause serious harm to the equity of global brands. Our company is partnering with the relevant authorities to provide accurate data to consumers when and as needed. The VAT introduction will force all SMEs, which are the majority of our customers, to implement IT systems. It is crucial for us to partner with banks to ensure our customers are using credit cards.</p><p><strong>What are other the major risks the Omani F&amp;B sector faces in the medium term, and what strategies are you planning to adopt to hedge them?</strong><br>The future of the F&amp;B sector depends on several factors. For the CPG industry, the biggest factors are fluctuations in the prices of raw materials and changes in consumer trends. Through our ongoing monitoring and forward purchasing, we have been able to mitigate these risks while continuously listening to our consumers and getting feedback. In 2019, our company led several initiatives in partnership with organizations and government institutions such as such Topfruit, the Ministry of Tourism, Aquafina, Spartan Sport Race, Cheetos, and Muscat Eat Food Festival, to name a few.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the growth of food delivery &amp; e-commerce in Oman to impact the local F&amp;B sector, and what are the key requirements to remain ahead of the innovation curve?</strong><br>We are witnessing a rapid growth in e-commerce and food delivery in Oman. We have partnered with major platforms in Oman through which we aim to provide F&amp;B offers to our loyal consumers at the best prices and conditions possible. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were your main highlights of 2019, and how were they important for OFIC's medium-term strategy?<br></strong>2019 was a good year, as we successfully completed our first project, Mazoon Dairy. Today, we have other SKUs coming, such as yogurt and laban. Mazoon Dairy has also introduced renewable energy for the first time. The plant uses biogas as another source of green energy produced from animal waste, and the energy from the gas is used for heating and boiling. The wise use of natural resources is embedded in the entire process. OFIC works with international and national players to make sure the entire group adopts sustainable means in all its new initiatives and projects. In 2020, OFIC launched the first firm focusing on producing animal vaccines. It is also building a project to can tuna and sardines in 2020. OFIC will also focus on poultry sector and will most likely see the first product in the market in mid-2021. A number of other small projects will continue to support Oman's food needs and complete the food cycle.</p><p><strong>How much product does Oman import compared to what is grown in the country?<br></strong>We are definitely near to closing important gaps leading to import substitution. In dairy, we expect to be 90-100% self-sufficient in the next 10 years. We will be able to produce more milk in the country by first increasing our herd size and subsequently by improving the productivity of the cows, which is a matter of herd management. We have to do this in a natural, comfortable, and sustainable manner in a controlled environment in line with the best animal welfare practices.</p><p><strong>Where else do you see technology being utilized in the agriculture and fisheries industry?<br></strong>The applicability of technologies to agriculture is infinite. For example, the One Million Date Palm Project is now experimenting with drones to pollinate date palm trees and, in the future, harvest and even transport products to the relevant site or even storage. This technology can be scaled incredibly. Similarly, through an app, we can monitor our livestock. This will allow us to improve production, reduce waste, and control costs, enabling us to provide customers with an affordable end product.</p><p><strong>How do you balance the potential to create opportunities for SMEs and the drive toward automation that does away with manual labor?</strong><br>Whenever technology is applied, new jobs are created for white-collar, tech-savvy people, while downstream opportunities become available for SMEs. As such, to succeed, planning is essential. Mazoon dairy is a huge project that we will have to wait three years for until we see financial returns. The products will compete with imports, which may receive subsidies. Our competitive edge has to focus on the product design, with best practices in terms of finance and management. The need for venture capital is crucial for the growth of SMEs, though there should be new innovative models to attract that funding, whether in terms of productivity per square meter, recycling of materials such as water and soil, or implementing technological tools for monitoring and handling.</p><p><strong>What should be the focus of R&amp;D within the SME sector?<br></strong>Looking at the full cycle, from conceptualization to commercialization, there is a gap in the area of incubation, which is why  OFIC decided to launch a project called the Food Techno Park. The idea is to take ideas from their early conceptualization stage, work with SMEs, and lead them through the process of incubation and coaching before introducing them to the right technologies and allowing them to test different types of recipes. The relevant experts can mentor and coach them to reach the prototyping facilities around the ecosystem and then take it to the commercialization level. In the next few years, Oman will witness the birth of a huge ecosystem that will allow all stakeholders and those with new ideas in and outside Oman to come and innovate. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have operations evolved over the last year, and how have they reflected the trends in Oman and the overall education sector?<br></strong>While previously the focus was more on the number of individuals prepared for the job market, today the stress is on obtaining the best quality and a greater output. This is a positive sign, since companies are more invested in developing people. This makes our business more relevant. Technology wise, we are still in the early phases—the general masses are still in the traditional mode of learning, although learning technologies bear excellent potential to be applied. The drive to learn from within is yet to come, though it will eventually. Moreover, the market is investing in technology, especially at this moment of budgetary restraints, where any investment and capital expenditure is carefully looked at. Technological advancements should also come with high-level of coordination between institutions and the workforce, and we are witnessing this only partially in the banking and oil and gas sectors.</p><p><strong>What will be the main source of revenues for NTI moving forward?<br></strong>Since most private companies in Oman do not have the culture of investing in people, the public sector will continue to represent our main revenue stream. As we are in the business of Omanization, government funds are unlocked once we find jobs for Omanis. In this sense, the sectors expected to contribute the most, namely oil and gas, engineering, construction, and manufacturing, will continue to play a big role, and we plan on developing tourism and mining. The government is placing great focus on logistics, though the sector has always been a key area of focus for us, especially since it has traditionally been geared to serve the oil and gas industry.</p><p><strong>What is the key for the private and educational institutes to adjust to the new regulations from the Ministry of Manpower and Labor?</strong><br>Omanis need to increase education and skill level and develop a competitive attitude for finding jobs and performing jobs. Employers are used to getting cheap labor from Asia and earning high profits, but this will have to be sacrificed. They need to adapt and bring in a people-developing culture. The employers need to fuel directly into developing their Omani employees, even if this implies spending and investing. Once that happens, Oman will definitely be far ahead of the rest. In the meantime, a more gradual approach to Omanization is preferable. However, there are some great examples of multinational companies that have been investing their time and money in the right direction and reaping the benefits now. These should be examples to follow.</p><p><strong>What is a common trait among these companies?<br></strong>Common traits include their size and international partnerships. These companies have a structured program to recruit, train, and develop their Omani employees. They spare no efforts to ensure that the right people are recruited, trained for a period of time by the quality training providers, and then deployed in a development program until they achieve the required comeptence levels. Then, we have companies who are very reliant on expatriate workers and do not have a structured approach to developing local talent. These employers face bigger challenges and they need to change their strategy and maangement to include a structured program for the development of Omanis. On the other hand, we have a challenge with Omanis, who have a mindset of entitlement. Omanis need to get into being competitive and start earning their right for employment and development. When both the employer and the employees make this paradigm shift, Omanization will truly be seen as successful. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lifting-the-industry]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the major challenges and biggest gaps facing the agricultural industry and agribusiness in Oman?<br></strong>Most of the challenges that farmers and agribusiness face are mostly related to efficiency. Oman has a great deal of natural resources and one of the richest fisheries, and we need to make sure our fresh and canned fish can reach the market in a good state and timeframe. We need to seek help from agri-partners in countries that have a solid structure for our sector. We cannot rely on the conventional processes we were used to. With Tanfeedh, we have seen great progress; the right warehousing and supply chain are present. Then, we should have a calibration between logistics and agricultural products so we can capture our share of this market in the region.</p><p><strong>Does development need to come mostly from public sector initiatives for the time being or should the private sector drive this?</strong><br>This could be achieved through PPPs and other arrangements. We need to look more at the private sector with government arms such as Oman Global Logistics Group (ASYAD) and Oman Investment and Finance Co. (OIFC) playing a part in supporting and motivating key investors. The government should use its strength as a key advocate to help SMEs play a part in the industry, creating many jobs for Omanis. It could bridge the gaps between OIFC and ASYAD to help young Omanis, who have been using conventional processing in the past, to either create new manufacturing plants or use new production chains. If people can see the effort and approach in each region and company in Oman, they can see there is a platform that applies across the country. Oman could generate a solid revenue from this, though it will never happen unless we invest in the entire supply chain. We should use our strengths and engage with partners in other areas to lift our practices and industry to global standards.</p><p><strong>What role do foreign players have in ensuring global standards are achieved?</strong><br>We should look at the farmers in Brazil or the Netherlands. Those countries have the best practices when it comes to consumable items and supply chain outcomes. We could associate with those companies to help us with the set up in our industry. We first need to secure the local market and then build up the volume we need to generate sales out of this market. In addition, we need to build a reputation, and for that we need to look for global strategic partners, such as retail outlets. Now, most of our exports go to certain markets, though people do not see that these products meet certain international standards when it comes to handling, processing, grading, and so on. Now, with the government support and the introduction of best practices, this should give consumers the comfort they seek. We need to ensure that Omani products overseas sit unique and exceptional, with their own identity. We need to collaborate to properly market ourselves.</p><p><strong>How will innovation come into play in this massive transformation, and will the new technology come from within Oman or from abroad?<br></strong>We need to look wherever the best automated processes are being used. Some of our products can easily be damaged unless there is efficiency behind their handling and processing. We need the best solutions to replace traditional processes. It will be costly for people to shift from one system to another; however, that is the only way we can sustain our businesses into the future. We have a younger generation today that is focused on technology and driven to get there. Today, people have tracking systems and other equipment that allow them to build greater efficiency. We should not resist these developments. We should be open-minded and embrace all new technology and innovation that can drive excellence in our processes. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How do you expect technology to impact the education sector in Oman and how is Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) embracing digitalization and IT solutions?<br></strong>Leading education institutions across the world are moving toward various forms of electronic and distance education options. As one of the region's most prominent universities, SQU is focusing on the effective delivery of online undergraduate and postgraduate programs. In fact, the university's Strategic Plan 2016-2040 details the importance of investing in technology-based learning and distance education to promote accessibility and the dynamic delivery of course content. The steps taken by SQU in this regard have made it the leading provider of online higher education programs in Oman. Having both the necessary technological resources and in-house expertise has enabled SQU to implement online and Emergency Remote Teaching and Learning (ERTL) at a time when face-to-face instruction is not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic. SQU uses technology, digitalization, and IT solutions in the research and training conducted by its nine colleges and 14 research centers. We have various labs across the university that utilize cutting-edge technologies for these purposes, including the IoT and Smart Cities Lab and Open-Free Sources Lab. The university also utilizes technology to transform SQU campus into a Smart Zero Emission campus.  The Sustainable Energy Research Centre is playing a key role in this.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the socioeconomic transformation the Sultanate is witnessing? What role is SQU playing in this regard?</strong><br>The objectives and directions outlined in Oman Vision 2040 are vital for the country to become a skills-driven, knowledge-based society that is at the forefront of the fourth industrial revolution. SQU supports its students in the development of research skills and innovative mindsets necessary to produce cutting-edge, innovative outputs. SQU also supports the transformation of innovative ideas and outputs into value-added products and services that result in start-ups and other innovative enterprises. These efforts are led by the Innovation and Technology Transfer Centre. As the only public university in Oman, our mission is helping the country achieve Vision 2040. SQU is collaborating with numerous entities across various sectors to promote economic development and SMEs. We are also planning to solidify our research infrastructure by establishing a research centers complex. The complex will combine all the research centers' resources to maximize impact, while also ensuring that research output is transformed into products that add value to the economy.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the job market to evolve in the medium term?<br></strong>As both the fourth industrial revolution and the social and economic transformation envisaged in Vision 2040 continue to unfold, the skills and industries driving Oman's economy are also changing. To ensure that Oman is ideally positioned to take advantage of these changes, it is important that academia and industry align with the country's development plans. It is for these reasons that we have joined hands with various sectors and have involved their experts in the constant revision and development of our curricula. The private sector also supports SQU. For example, Occidental Oman has contributed USD2.7 million to purchase equipment for the Sustainable Energy Research Centre. SQU is currently in the process of establishing a Science and Technology Park that will bring key stakeholders together and enhance Oman's development in strategic areas.</p><p><strong>What can you tell us about SQU's research capabilities?<br></strong>SQU is not only Oman's leading research university but is also among the best research universities in the region. This is evident from SQU's position in international university rankings, such as the QS rankings, and the number of SQU-affiliated scientific publications appearing in Scopus- and Web of Science-indexed sources. Our nine colleges and 14 research centers engage in multidisciplinary studies in areas of strategic importance. SQU's research infrastructure will continue to develop and serve Oman's sustainable development goals. We have established a model of how universities across the country can ensure their research and development endeavors fully align with the country's needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What short-term trends do you expect in the real estate and construction sector?<br></strong>There are three segments in the market. There are several major companies spearheading projects worth OMR50 million and above. Then, there are medium-sized companies operating projects worth between OMR2 million and OMR10 million, which is where we fall in. There are also hundreds of companies operating projects that are worth less than OMR1 million. Since 2015, despite the constraints in the market, we have been able to get projects and grow every year by 30-40%. In our segment, there are less residential projects coming in but more commercial projects like schools, hotels, apartments, and so on.</p><p><strong>How do you think regional transport improvements will benefit the real estate and construction sector?</strong><br>Most of the new infrastructure projects are concentrated in the Duqm area. Around Muscat, there are already enough roads, and we don't foresee many new projects in that regard. The biggest test for the government now is Duqm. All of the big projects and new refineries are there. Once those are up and running, other projects will follow. That's the area to focus on, and every construction company in Oman is focusing on Duqm. We are submitting bids as well. On the other hand, projects that connect Oman to other GCC countries will obviously give a major boost to all the players. For now, every player is struggling with margins, so a small reduction in logistics costs would help improve our bottom line a lot.</p><p><strong>How do you expect supply and demand in the real estate sector to evolve over the next years?</strong><br>There is an oversupply in the market. Some smart people, however, are finding the right locations and building accordingly. For example, our prices were much higher four years ago compared to now because of market conditions. Our margins are at less than 10% nowadays, much less than before. Anyone who is building is barely getting a return on their investment, but they do that by building at a lesser cost. There are still many people who want to build, and there are a lot of projects coming in. There are always six to seven tenders on our table. There is a lot of desire to build, so people are holding onto their designs and waiting for the right time. At present, we are building more commercial spaces. Even in the residential segment, where we used to see apartments, we are now seeing more villa clusters coming in. One project has around 45 villas in one complex. We are currently involved in a project in Muscat called Rose Village with 39 villas. Some companies are building head offices, and we are doing the same for Al Roya Press &amp; Publishing in Airport Heights. Many schools are also coming in, and we are close to signing a OMR7-million bid with an international school in Muscat.</p><p><strong>How is digitalization taking place in Oman's real estate sector?</strong><br>New technology is being adopted faster in Oman than anywhere. Companies here are quick to learn, obtain materials, apply technology, and use new methodologies. When I compare Oman with anywhere else in the world, the materials, technology, and equipment being used here are the best of the lot. For example, companies are using 3D modeling and BIM. These technologies are new in Oman, but considering how proactive the construction companies have been, things are moving quickly.</p><p><strong>What are your criteria for tendering for new projects?</strong><br>The first thing we look at is the client and their financial position. This is important because many people start a project but are unable to finish it. If a client's project funding is properly available and if the project's size is within the range in which we operate, and we know the margin won't fall below a certain threshold, we are more likely to bid. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your reading of the market slowdown of the past four years, and how do you see the future of the contracting sector in Oman?<br></strong>The economy suffered significantly as a result of the decline in oil prices, and construction companies were not immune to that. The growth rate is retracting, though it is not that bad because the boom of 2014, 2015, and 2016, when the price of oil was USD120 per barrel and attracted too many companies, which was unsustainable. As such, the market is currently correcting itself and adapting to the new situation. Looking toward the future, the construction of villas and homes in Oman will continue, even if they are done by small companies. Second, there are certain sectors in the country where construction is booming like never before, such as oil and gas, including the petrochemical sector. Huge infrastructure projects like the Duqm refinery, Sohar, and Liwa Plastics are ongoing. The third sector that will always continue to develop is power and water. In terms of power, there is clean energy, and there are projects around. There are also projects in water distribution. Unfortunately, contractors in other sectors are feeling the heat because there are no government projects. The budget for ministries was reduced by 15% in 2018, and there is no uniform distribution of work. Moving forward, all initiatives of Tanfeedh will come to plan. There are many projects now in the Salalah Free Zone and Sohar Free Zone. Madayn is also quite active, creating more industrial estates and expanding existing ones. The big contractors will benefit from this.</p><p><strong>What main initiatives can businesses in Oman expect from a regulatory standpoint?<br></strong>One great initiative that we hope will be launched soon is the classification of contractors. At present, the construction sector is in a mess. We have about 6,000 companies that have registered for construction. This figure is wrong because there are about 500-600 companies—1,000 maximum—that do the majority of the work, and the others disrupt the market. They undercut prices and fail to finish projects. The Oman Society of Contractors is planning to design a classification similar to ISO. A third party will inspect companies to determine if they have the resources and experience, the right systems, a financial expert, an HSC advisor, a quality manager, and so on in place. We want this classification to be accepted by all government agencies.</p><p><strong>Why are the new set of laws that came up in 2019 and early 2020 revolutionary for Oman's business environment?<br></strong>Oman today boasts five impressive laws and new authorities: Company Law, Foreign Investment Law, PPP Law, Privatization Law, and Bankruptcy Law. While the bureaucracy still lags, initiatives such as InvestEasy by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry have created a one-stop shop in an efficient way. Aside from covering mainly a regulatory role, the government is committed to spearheading digitalization.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations for 2020?<br></strong>On the macro level, there will not be much of a change compared to 2019 except in the Khazzan gas field. There is a great deal of interest from upstream operators around the world, such as Total, ENI, and other big players. In the corporate environment, people are going green, cutting costs, and becoming more efficient. SCC has a motto: We look after relationships, not projects. New projects will come as a result of our relationships. There was a tough but fair client with whom we worked last year, Majid Al Futtaim. It has acquired us, and now it will undertake any project we offer. We have at least 10 clients, and they work with us. We prefer to be transparent and lay all the cards on the table to build a relationship. Some people may do things differently; however, you must go that route to be successful globally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Al Hayat International Hospital was established 25 years ago. Where is the institution headed over the coming years?<br></strong>We are planning to expand our services by launching a new 100-bed hospital in Muscat within the next four years. The new hospital will focus on cardiology and orthopedics, building on our strengths and adding new departments. We are expanding because it is one of the main ways to strike the right balance to pursue volume. When you do high volume work, your prices can be competitive without compromising on quality, which we intend to leverage to push tertiary care to higher standards. At the same time, we intend to open satellite clinics across Oman. We have three clinics in Muscat, but we intend to build 10 additional facilities in Muscat and 20 additional clinics elsewhere in Oman. Our plan is to get all these facilities and clinics operational by the time the new hospital is ready. We are moving in that direction and are in touch with investors both within and outside the country.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the healthcare sector to contribute to non-oil GDP, and what role does the private sector play in this?</strong><br>The government has been focusing on tourism and the healthcare industry can complement its initiatives by improving the standard of service. If Oman's healthcare sector is up to international standards, people from certain developing countries in Africa and Asia will choose Oman for medical treatment. Today, many patients are traveling from Oman to Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. We would like our hospitals to contribute to the reversal of that trend so that people from other countries come here for treatment. That means that the service has to improve and prices have to be highly competitive. Oman is reducing reliance on public hospitals by redirecting people to private facilities. By doing so, the state is auditing private hospitals more to make sure they meet minimum standards and follow best international practices. The government outsources diagnostics and treatment only after a thorough reviewal and approval process.</p><p><strong>What are the main reasons behind the low treatment costs in Oman?</strong><br>One reason is insurance and the introduction of auditing managers in the healthcare industry, which are able to control costs better. Another factor is the decline in the doctors' share of fees in developed countries. The second point is new technology, which is IT based. By using new technology, hospitals are able to reduce costs. Despite all these factors, the cost of treatment has not fallen quite as much because it is expensive to invest in new medicines and technologies.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of Oman developing an autonomous R&amp;D sector?</strong><br>At present, Oman is able to manufacture the medicines it needs. As a result, dependence on imports is declining. The cost of drugs we use has fallen tremendously in recent years. Oman is also manufacturing generics. At the same time, Oman has the ability to manufacture medical consumables that do not involve highly advanced technology and are commonly used in hospitals. Manufacturing such products will help control prices in Oman. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are some of the key challenges in Oman's healthcare sector, and how can healthcare providers such as Burjeel Hospital align their strategic priorities to face these challenges?</strong></p><p>Traveling abroad for healthcare is a declining trend in specific areas, such as oncology. Trust in the private sector has grown. For example, while tertiary care is still dominated by public facilities, our goal is to increase our activities in tertiary segment and complex cases. We have started chemotherapy, cardiac catheterizations, and spine surgeries, receiving confidence from high-profile cases. There should be healthy competition in the market in the sense that the private sector should expand into tertiary care and not be limited to primary and secondary care. Moreover, to efficiently reverse this trend of outward medical tourism and instead attract patients from abroad, healthcare providers should capitalize on the natural beauty of the country. As such, we have a plan to set up a natural wellness center for rehabilitation along the coastline.</p><p><strong>What are the main business opportunities for the private sector under Vision 2040?</strong><br>PPPs will allow the government to reduce its spending on healthcare. Outsourcing different areas to private centers is a huge opportunity to improve efficiency and increase private-sector contribution. Muscat has a plethora of hospitals, but in the peripheries of the country, there are still many opportunities for the private sector to engage. Small hospital centers instead of clinics are the way forward to attract patient in the hamlets, and only after, if necessary, can one move patients to larger centers in the city.</p><p><strong>What is the key to balancing profitability and affordability?<br></strong>Healthcare costs will be determined by two factors: equipment and human resources. Machines are always a huge problem given that they quickly become outdated; however, with AI in the picture, dependence on human resources can be reduced. AI will require a hefty investment, but it will deliver quality, and in the medium to long run, it will drive down costs. The key to balancing profitability and affordability is delivering quality services that prevent multiple cycles of treatment for the same patient. Once the quality goes up, profitability will improve. At the same time, the rollout of a mandatory insurance scheme will ensure a greater degree of affordability. Mandatory insurance is a necessary measure because it will increase hospital visits and benefit blue-collar workers.</p><p><strong>Where do you expect technological advances, such as automation, AI, IoT, and digitalization of services to have the highest impact in the healthcare sector?</strong><br>Computers with cognitive functions will affect all aspects of healthcare provision. Computers can store large amounts of data, which AI can analyze, making professions such as radiologists obsolete, for example. Google has launched an eye scanner that can diagnose diabetic retinopathy, a condition that leads to blindness. After continuous studies on the eye scanner, doctors are able to use it to predict heart attacks with a timespan of up to one year with unprecedented accuracy. This example shows the immense capabilities of AI, which as doctors we have to embrace. Doctors will still be required, but diagnoses will be much more efficient than the past. While AI will impact treatment at a later stage, diagnosis and prevention areas will witness a strong impact.</p><p><strong>What role does Burjeel Hospital play in Oman's healthcare sector?</strong><br>Oman was missing the sort of infrastructure required to meet the demands of the higher social classes. As such, Burjeel Hospital undertook a series of investments to raise the level of quality care and prevent these people from traveling abroad for treatment. Today, anyone who comes to our hospital can afford our costs; ministers, royal family members, and top executives all come to Burjeel Hospital to receive top-notch healthcare treatment combined with the kind of luxury that is similar to a seven-star hotel. Such an environment makes it also easier for the doctors, as the patient's mindset is much more relaxed. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are your thoughts regarding the evolution of the public healthcare system in the short term? <br></strong>The quality of healthcare services in Oman is comparable to any other developed country; however, many people seek a second opinion abroad, as it is their right to do so. The marketing of the private sector in Oman is not at the level where it should be. What is still lacking is the trust of the public and the awareness of just what is available. Much will depend on the decision to introduce health insurance for citizens and residents. The decision has not been made yet for Omanis, but has already been taken for expatriates, who today require coverage. This is a high-level decision. Of course, to use an approach that considers universal healthcare insurance coverage, many requirements need to be put in place first. The government has partnered with a private institution, a university from South Korea, to devise a draft document on the requirements of establishing universal insurance coverage.</p><p><strong>How can PPPs help achieve the goals set by the Ministry of Health, and what will be their impact on tertiary healthcare? </strong><br>When it comes to hospitals, tertiary, or outpatient care, PPPs work well. Often, the PPP model allows the government to work with partners who as experts in the field have greater efficiency and utilization of resources. The model also expedites investment, which allows for a timelier meeting of demand. Government processes take a long time while the private sector can supplement that with its quicker reaction time to the demand for new services and so on.</p><p><strong>What is the current status of preventative healthcare, and how can it be improved?</strong><br>In Oman, preventative healthcare is a strong area of focus, with child immunization rates among the highest in the world. Moreover, the country's overall structure allows for a general healthy condition, with a robust water supply, state-of-the-art sewage and hygiene infrastructure, and free access to healthcare. Cancer screening programs are rather costly, but they are a crucial element of preventive healthcare. Oman has now introduced a breast cancer screening program, with other screening programs in the pipeline, such as colon cancer and cervical cancer. These are all country-specific, as early detection determines both treatment and outcome.</p><p><strong>What do you think about the advent of digitalization in medical services and the medical profession, and what are your concerns regarding patient data security?</strong><br>Our entire health information system has being digitalized. We have had paperless medical records for years, which has given us many advantages. Oman has a nationwide individual medical record inclusive of medical history and treatments, which can be accessed from anywhere. In terms of confidentiality and data security, there is always a risk, but the government opted to have this information on an internal server and not connected to the internet. The main change is our increasing dependency on technology, and with AI already there, we are poised to enhance patient services by bringing them more satisfaction. Indeed, although it is costly, whether applied to equipment or medications, it will improve the quality of our services and ultimately lead to better utilization of services.</p><p><strong>What are your priorities for 2020, and what are the strategic drivers behind them?</strong><br>In 2019, we reviewed our mission and created hospital-wide goals such that each department sets their own objectives. Ultimately, we aim to maximize patient experience within the hospital from the time they enter until they leave, as well as all interactions within the hospital, and also our efficiency in service delivery. We are focused on bolstering the brand of the Royal Hospital. We have introduced a number of latest treatments. We have a national heart center that has introduced numerous procedures over the last two years. We also have a major upcoming project involving the expansion of our pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In Oman, it started operations in 2005, carrying Sailh Rawl Project and establishing TR Engineering LLC. Since then, it has been awarded several other projects, the biggest of which is Duqm Refinery Project to execute the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC), commissioning, and start-up of process units for a new 230,000-bpd refinery. The contract sees Tecnicas Reunidas in a 65% JV with South Korean firm Daewoo (JV-TRD). While developing the engineering and procurement activities in Madrid and Seoul, construction started in Duqm in November 2018. The goal is to develop a large, highly efficient, and environmentally sustainable world-class refinery through an effective combination of labor and capital held together by stringent rules of safety. Indeed, a large percentage of the 600 workers we employ directly as part of the JV-TRD team are Omanis who want to develop their careers. Through the construction and services subcontractors, another 10,000 workers will be participating in this project, a significant portion of them Omanis as well. To build the refinery, we acquired through a globalized procurement strategy materials and equipment from all around the world, including suppliers from Spain, South Korea, India, and Japan, among others, and from GCC as well with an important participation of Omani suppliers. Recently, we imported four reactors from India, and the logistics support provided by the Port of Duqm was excellent.</p><p><strong>Why is it important for international players to take care of the social aspect when working in Oman?<br></strong>While government protection of local resources is widespread around emerging markets around the world and especially the GCC, in Oman there are specific requirements to develop of local industry that is not seen in other countries. The social aspect is an extremely important factor to bear in mind for every international player seeking to work in Oman. One of the most straightforward ways to showcase commitment is employing a large share of Omanis and ensuring they acquire the necessary skills to advance in their professions. This investment in human capital not only benefits the host country but can potentially lead to future benefits under a business development point of view. For example, Oman has a refinery industry but wants to focus on the petrochemical industry. This presents a great opportunity for us, since we want to stay here long term.</p><p><strong>What is your approach when selecting subcontractors?</strong><br>The various EPC projects are more or less similar in nature, and we need to employ subcontractors with enough experience carrying similar type of work. We prepare a selection panel and judge the bids based on financial positions, experience in similar scope of works, and capacities to move people and equipment. Oman offers many local companies with experience in the civil construction sector, so there is space for us to perform a thorough technical and commercial evaluation. However, we have noticed some difficulties in contracting a highly qualified local company in the electromechanical sector with the required capacity for so huge project like this, which is a sector the country has to develop.</p><p><strong>In what areas lie the most potential to update the existing technology?</strong><br>In the construction sector, technology is of the utmost importance when it comes to accessing data or real-time information. The handling of information is paramount these days to improve efficiency and productivity, for analyzing scenarios and for making decisions. Specifically, this new way of working is providing a good way to work for the EPC industry. As for the procurement part, connectivity with suppliers is vital. In construction, knowing what is under production every day, how resources move, and the day-to-day developments are a must for setting the strategies to follow increasing the productivity and the efficiency of the resources available. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will the COVID-19 outbreak impact the Omani business environment in the medium term?<br></strong>COVID-19 has had a huge impact on economies around the world, including Oman, as the lockdown measures will have a direct effect on the country's GDP. The crisis will witness a first phase focused on saving lives and a second one geared toward kickstarting the economy, with job creation as its main priority. The low oil price environment is affecting all businesses, though it is being contained as much as possible. For Renaissance, although parts of our services have shut down, with extensive cost-cutting measures, the safety of our employees and customers has been the most important aspect of our initiatives. At the same time, we play our part in keeping the health services going by providing essential services such as cleaning and sanitizing, laundry operations, and feeding services to all public hospitals. For Renaissance, the major challenge has been maintaining a stable supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), though thankfully we never ran out. Finally, we have also leveraged our logistics reach and scale of people to prepare and deliver food supplies to quarantine, support, and outbreak centers all over the country.</p><p><strong>How should Oman position itself with regard to the current low oil prices, and what is required from the private sector across the value chain?</strong><br>Both public and private sector, including oil and gas, will need to look at how to drive down costs, which will likely lead to more outsourcing of non-core services. Working in a collaborative way ensures no one takes the brunt, and all players across the value chain will minimize the consequences from the current situation. The government needs to spend less, so the private sector must step up and find a way to keep the major projects going. Driving efficiencies will be the mandatory guideline for private companies like Renaissance as well, and few models offer a viable solution to meet this goal. We have been providing permanent accommodation to blue-collar workforces in remote oil and gas fields, showing it is possible to build low-cost, high-quality structures compliant with international labor standards through the economies of scale. Many labor facilities happened to be outbreak areas, as social distancing was not applicable. It is thus crucial to ensure people live with dignity at an appropriate cost.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations from Vision 2040, and what is required to support the economic growth of the Sultanate?</strong><br>The key issue is finding a way to scale the learning lessons from the crisis to allow Oman to compete on a global scale. Tanfeedh addressed all the right questions, recognizing that diversification of the economy is crucial; however, the process needs to be accelerated, perhaps with the inclusion of new elements of the sustainability agenda. More specifically, the national employment roadmap needs to be redrawn to support growth and not hinder it. For this same reason, deep austerity and cost-cutting measures would not favor the Omani economy. Instead, new legislations around FDI and privatization will reduce the government burden and, at the same time, support the economic development of the country. PPPs are also a viable solution, and Oman has a great opportunity to learn from both failed and successful PPP projects worldwide. Moreover, the traditional model of opening up tenders to a wide variety of players, when only a few will be able to deliver it, needs to be revisited in the name of transparency and efficiency. The private sector needs to be realistic instead of lowering down prices at all costs to win the tender. There are plenty of opportunities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the potential of the mining sector?<br></strong>Oman is blessed with diverse portfolio of metallic and non-metallic minerals distributed across the Sultanate. In the government's view, mining ticks all of the boxes as a new economic sector with the potential to enhance Oman's long-term economic diversification. As per PAM, it is estimated that only 3% of our commercial resources are being exploited. The country has a strategic location, with solid infrastructure and a robust industry. MDO has identified seven strategic minerals, centring on the exploitation of copper, to drive its future growth. We also focus on the development of Shaleem Mining Block, a massive 3,500-sqkm block of gypsum, limestone, and dolomite confirmed resources that will lead the future of Oman industrial minerals' growth. MDO is also focusing on other commodities driven by market needs such as salt and on developing upstream, middle, and downstream opportunities for value addition. The potentials are huge, and the opportunities are attractive for both the Omani mining sector in general and MDO specifically.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the technical abilities to develop the sector?<br></strong>The country has identified mining as one of the strategic sectors for the country diversification strategy. Therefore, many initiatives and plans were put to activate the sector and unleash its potential; however, there is a strong emphasis on the sector's capacity to grow without adequate caliber to support this growth. Therefore, the sector is striving to attract the international mining know-how beside the financial resources. Oman is blessed with well-educated and passionate human resources that are looking for an opportunity to prove themselves. The mining sector can absorb these talents and nurture them across the value chain. In this regard, MDO is seen as an important enabler of the government achieving not only its economic diversification vision and objectives, but also a driving vehicle to attract state-of-the-art technologies, as well as build local capabilities for sustainable mining industries. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What services will experience the largest growth in 2020 in Oman?<br></strong>The largest growth in 2020 will be in exploration because large-scale exploration has not been done in Oman. The entire country has total exploration of around 125,000m of drilling, and it should develop 40,000-50,000m per year and is currently moving in that direction. To discover minerals, you have to do exploration, and for that local geologists are needed. We are training and developing Omani geologists. We already have a great team, and that is key, as we cannot do exploration based on a 30-day visa since it is a long-term commitment. Other than that, there is a need for innovation, which we are working on internally, doing a great deal of software development and AI. There are many technologies in mining that can improve one's efficiencies and cut costs as the commodity price cannot be controlled. The only thing one can do is reduce costs through innovative technologies such as drone-based surveying, monitoring, satellite mapping, and drone-based geophysics.</p><p><strong>What room for improvement is there in terms of collaboration between the public and private sector in the local mining industry?</strong><br>We bring in the latest technology and software and use it in our work across Oman. Moreover, when big companies come in, they bring in new ideas and training opportunities, sustainable development, and smart mining. However, the ease of doing business must improve. The Public Authority of Mining has been unnecessarily loaded with many compliances. In mining, there should be licenses for just two things: the mining license, which falls under the Public Authority of Mining, and environmental clearance. Right now, companies have to apply to the Public Authority of Mining, which is responsible for getting approval from nine other industries that do not know the importance of mining. If we have in place environment clearance, then the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs can be responsible to ensure mining is being done in an environmentally friendly way instead of not handing out licenses. In other countries, it is easy and quick to apply for a license. According to the new mining law, a license can be provided in 60 days compared to between 60 days and 60 months in the past.</p><p><strong>What can the mining consulting industry offer in terms of Omanization?<br></strong>Mining is a priority sector for the government, though there is neither a mining education center in the country nor a single mining engineer student. The first thing the country needs to do is develop its own people as one cannot grow their industry with expats. Expats can come and train in the short term but cannot run the show for the country. Oman has a long-term vision, and it needs to be developed by training young Omanis and encouraging entrepreneurs to enter mining. Our Omanization rate is at 95%, and every month we are hiring, developing, and training in-house. We have experience working in 68 countries and plan to send some of our trainees to international projects to gain more exposure. We have transformed the industry, as five years ago there were no private consulting firms.</p><p><strong>What is the potential of the software development division of mining consultancy firms in 2020 to improve the business?</strong><br>Exploration data in the past was all handwritten, and we are still converting data to digital in Oman. The country therefore has lost money; a dynamic exploration database is required that is smart and monitors the process. If Oman does not do this, it cannot proceed further. If it does not analyze or quality control a sample, it will not be fit for purpose. We do this with automation of the field management. When an issue is flagged, we can call an operator remotely, so efficiency management is about monitoring one's equipment with software. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you give us a brief overview of today's landscape for mining activity in Oman and how will the new mining law impact the business environment?<br></strong>In 2018, we issued 26 mining licenses and 35 exploration licenses. This had created about 400 new jobs specifically for Omanis for an investment of OMR700 million. Based on the framework for the mining blocks offerings, we drafted the mining law and sent it for endorsement of those specifications. In order to improve the specifications, we developed an electronic platform that manages all mining and exploration activities and licenses. The platform has the potential to be linked to all governmental systems needed to get an approval. We are planning for the licenses to be applicable for at least five years rather than one, with the option of renewal until 25. We are also trying to put devices that recognize production amounts and send them to the authorities, in order to make follow-up production amount applications unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Another law that recently came out is the PPP Law. Under an infrastructural point of view, how can this new law help the mining sector?</strong><br>PPPs will constitute a key aspect of the infrastructural developments under the new mining strategy, as Oman needs to ensure high-quality road connectivity to either the manufacturing site or production hubs. There are ongoing discussions to build two ports with the Ministry of Transport. In addition, we awarded a consultancy study to define the infrastructural requirement to improve and develop the downstream industry, because that is where the added value could be created. Today, we are offering these blocks for investors, though if they want to build a factory that requires some of the minerals they extract, they have priority over other players, without the need to go through the bidding process.</p><p><strong>What is your mapping of the private sector engagement in Oman's mining industry, and how does that define your priorities for 2020?</strong><br>There are 300 companies with mining licenses, not including exploration licenses, and we have yet to define the criteria to ensure that each company is the best for the right block. A great deal still has to be brought in from abroad, either from the know-how or the investment because over the last decades we have seen exploration activities fall, and we need to manage a healthy portfolio. Larger players need to be given priority, and first and second processing manufacturing are also important. In this environment, our first priority is to focus on a framework for competitive biddings and launching new licenses. Indeed, we aim to make the investment methodology a continuous, transparent, and simplified process. This will allow us to maximize the economic value of the blocks we announced as open for bids and to understand the full contribution of each mining block and the spinoff activities and opportunities that could arise from them both for other businesses and communities. In this sense, innovation for the mining industry will be paramount because it will help utilize every element of minerals, creating value-added products, instead of just exporting the raw materials. It would also help in terms of improving efficiency and cost-effectiveness. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the status of Port of Duqm's infrastructure development, and how do these developments highlight the strategic roadmap of the port?</strong><br>According to the initial timeline, the Port of Duqm will become a full capacity port capable of handling full-fledged operations by the end of 2020. In the meantime, we are actively looking for proper partners in different areas, such as operations, freight forwarding, and logistics. The choice of players we approach has to be cautious, because partnerships in the industry will redefine our business models. Historically, ports used to be built and operated by governments because the payback on just the quay holds is extremely long-term and rarely bankable. However, the PPP model is changing the nature of ports from a standard authority to an enabler of the logistics industry. The private sector is thus starting to be approached in strategic, large investments with long-term commitments in the Middle East just like other parts of the world. Within this environment, ports are not only physical platforms, but also technological ones too, from where information exchanges and visibility are enhanced.</p><p><strong>What is the key to implementing technology where all key factors and pillars around port operations are successful and financially feasible?</strong><br>While automation in the ports started 15 years ago, logistics is a slow moving and conservative industry whose transition to automation will depend on the opportunity cost of new technological investments versus the cost of labor. For this reason, automation will happen first where labor is more expensive, and the transition will be slow because of the skills that are required will change dramatically. Indeed, the industry would need to move from employees with lower education to hiring engineers and IT experts capable of operating sophisticated machines. That being said, it will eventually embrace every aspect of the industry, although container business, because of its high standardization measures, is expected to witness it before regular cargo or dry bulk. Moreover, the container business is the most time sensitive because the margins are sharp and small. It is all a matter of how fast you go and how efficient you turn your ship in the port.</p><p><strong>How does consolidation under the ASYAD impact the port's logistics strategy?</strong><br>The consolidation of all ports within the ASYAD Group has as great advantage that a national strategy can be rolled out to the benefit of the entire nation. Having said that, it is clear that each of the three industrial ports in Oman has its own identity, is operating in a distinct business environment, and offers unique selling points according to its individual clientele. There will always be an element of competition amongst the three ports, but it is clear that the national goal of Oman to become a leading global logistical hub, taking full advantage of its prime location, requires the three ports to look at its individual strengths and capture the market in the most possible innovative and creative way. The international competitive market will regulate in the end where each of the opportunities will go, and the different offerings by each entity will enhance Oman's chances for success. It is ASYAD's merit, as the major shareholder in each of the ports, having created a common vision and ambition allowing each entity to fully develop and focus on its individual strengths, while creating a horizontal alignment across all players in the logistics industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the drivers behind the containment of COVID-19 cases?<br></strong>Oman is one of the few countries that have managed to keep its curve at a somewhat steady level so far, and this is due to a number of reasons, an important one is pre-planning and early preparedness. Strategies to contain the pandemic were developed based on previous experiences of Oman facing other disasters. Particularly for COVID-19, pandemic procedures were prepared since early January 2020, even before the international declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. The second factor has been the efficiency of our surveillance system for non-communicable diseases in spotting suspected cases and responding appropriately. Third, the partnership, engagement, and empowerment of all the sectors in mitigating the spread of the virus has been critical. The media has played a great role in engaging the community, as there were clear messages on prevention strategies broadcasted in different languages and using different platforms. This definitely helped raise awareness and increase the commitment of people to adhering to physical distancing regulations and stay-at-home orders. Finally, what has also helped is that the government has stayed rational and balanced in the decision-making process and taken into consideration local measures, factors, and situations. This led to a wider acceptance by the community and adherence to the regulations and saved the government from rushing into decisions, which may have been overturned given the rapid changes the course of the pandemic has taken.</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through some of the main statistics related to the COVID-19 pandemic and their significance?</strong><br>As of June 1, 2020, Oman had 12,800 cases of COVID-19, out of which only 6-8% needed admission to medical facilities versus 20% worldwide and only 1% of those admitted needed intensive care versus 5% globally. We have so far registered 57 deaths, which implies a death rate of 0.5%, whereas in countries like Italy, it is 12%. The population in Oman is considered a “young population," and this helps combat the disease as risk factors tend to be less. In addition to that, Oman has a solid health infrastructure with a widespread network of healthcare facilities. In order to ensure equity of healthcare access and services to all people, screening is provided free of charge to everyone, regardless of their ethnicity, legal conditions, immigration status, or any other barrier. Screening services followed by protective measures were provided at all primary healthcare facilities, outreach camps were set, and people were encouraged to come forward.</p><p><strong>Where do you see the major opportunities for the private sector to engage and turn challenges into opportunities?</strong><br>Partnerships between the private and government sectors is very important and have been instrumental in enhancing Oman's abilities to cope with the current pandemic. In Oman, we have enough ICU beds but not enough staff. This is where the private sector helped the ministry in receiving patients, and the ministry provided technical support and equipment as needed. The COVID-19 crisis has pushed us into realizing the importance of producing medical equipment locally. In the early stages, there was a desperate need for ventilators and PPE. However, now we are producing most of the equipment in Oman. The public and private sectors have been operating relentlessly to provide services to the community, at times free of cost. As such, one of the ministry's main objectives is to reconnect with the private sector, increase the shares of the private sector in the Omani market through PPPs, and regroup all public-sector facilities under one umbrella to reduce costs.</p><p><strong>How do you expect technological advances to impact the industry?</strong><br>The pandemic gave us the opportunity to set up virtual clinics together with the Royal Hospital, implement-tracking systems for patients and increase the feasibility of imaging. Robotic surgery is another area where technology can make a real difference in the outcome. The long-term savings brought by AI could be huge, especially in the diagnosis segment. Nonetheless, young doctors should always bear in mind that human touch will always be crucial. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[focusing-on-strengths]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How are the current macroeconomic conditions affecting the construction sector and your business strategy?<br></strong>Although the economy may not currently be ideal, we will remain proactive despite the challenges. We have several consultants on our team to help us perform better and navigate our way in this age of digital transformation. The market is currently cost conscious, and we must bid for tenders at lower prices. We are using it as an opportunity to improve, so that in 2020 we will devote more of a focus innovation, especially through methods of construction to raise productivity, which is a great challenge for a labor-intensive business such as ours. One way we are harnessing innovation, for example, is using prefabricated POD assets. We are also interested in block-laying robots that can reduce our dependence on labor. We will be able to contribute to the Omani economy only if we survive, which will be possible only with digitalization and increasing efficiency.</p><p><strong>What is the best way to create a sustainable contracting sector?<br></strong>As a company, we give work to 150 different SMEs across the country. When we do not perform a part of the work ourselves, we always prefer outsourcing to SMEs, rather than large companies. Our payments to SMEs form as much as 10% of our turnover. There are three SMEs that I mentored, and the office of one of them, Salalah Commercial, is in our building. Aside from giving them work, we help them with their procedures, teach them how to do business, share our expertise with them, and help them receive orders from sources other than our company and go outside their comfort zone. Because we shared our knowledge of procedures in this line of work with them from the first day, they are now more successful than their peers.</p><p><strong>What technological upgrades will have the greatest impact on your industry in the medium to long term, both in terms of efficiency and revenue?</strong><br>We are in the construction industry, and the only way to generate revenue is by winning more tenders and starting more projects. The next most important thing is the execution of a project with maximum quality and cost effectiveness. New technologies, robotics, and digitalization can help us both in the enhancement of quality and reductions of costs. If we win a 20-month project and finish it in 15 months, it will translate into profits for us.</p><p><strong>Can technologies adopted for cost-reduction purposes ultimately be presented as standalone divisions of your business?</strong><br>There are only two industries that we want to be in—construction and mining—and we want to be a one-stop shop in the area of construction. We want to cover the entire supply chain and be able to construct a building without having to go to anyone else. Admittedly, there are items that we do not manufacture in-house such as lights or tiles, though we can find suppliers for such things while still staying accountable for the final quality. Despite our focus on construction and mining, we have facilities dedicated to glass processing, aluminum, carpentry, and POD manufacturing.</p><p><strong>What are some of your strategic priorities for early 2020?<br></strong>The most important priorities for 1H2020 are perfecting our processes and making sure our operations are well-adjusted to the present economic landscape. I do not want to make any value judgements about the current situation; I just want to make sure we are well-adjusted to the current economic environment. We truly care about employment and take pride in employing a large group of people. We prefer to stay in this country and have a great success story rather than expanding outside and failing. We will remain focused on our line of work. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you guide us through the main pillars of your new strategy, and how you seek to leverage the strategic position of Duqm?<br></strong>Duqm is located in a unique area with mild weather between Muscat and Salalah close to the Indian Ocean and international trade routes. It is located close to more than 4 billion people of the Indian subcontinent, allowing for traders and investors to strategically target a huge international market. Moreover, it is administered by a one-stop shop authority, SEZAD, with its own regulations, which makes it attractive as an investment destination and as a place to run a business. These factors have attracted a good number of local and international players, which justified our investments in infrastructure. Phase I is 90% completed, which accounts for 40% of the total area, 2,000sqkm. The Port of Duqm will start full-fledged operations by 2021, while the drydock has already been fully operational for a while. The airport is operational, the gas pipeline is in its final stages, and water needs have been taken care of. These elements all together give a clear picture of the seriousness of our mandate and, while the main road still has to be completed, it gives us confidence to change our marketing strategy, resolving in taking a more targeted approach.</p><p><strong>What does SEZAD's new marketing strategy entail, and what is the investment model and investor profile you are targeting?</strong><br>Moving forward, our focus will be India and China, respectively. So far, the Chinese model has been successfully implemented in Duqm in different areas, including in light, medium, and heavy industry. The Chinese government has bought 10sqkm of land and needs to market it to its own companies back home. They must place all the infrastructure, including water, electricity, and roads. We want to create similar models with India, European countries, and the US, as Duqm can accommodate any type of business. So far, we have attracted companies in tourism, logistics, and other commercial business. However, we still need to make a lot of effort to keep attracting more industries. The presence of a refinery and the availability of the gas pipeline will make it attractive for downstream propositions and heavy industries, such as petrochemical, to make their footprint. Our focus on heavy industry and petrochemicals make up a good percentage of our business plan. But we also need to focus on other areas simultaneously because for people to come and stay here, they will need healthcare, education, hotels, and accommodation. As we speak, we have around 40,000 people that need an area to live, work, and travel. Eventually, our strategy is to have also a university, which has proven a successful anchor of development in other places around the world.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the current measures being taken by the government to attract FDI, and how does SEZAD position itself with regards to these efforts?</strong><br>The PPP law capitalizes on the Foreign Capital Law by helping Oman with ratings and helping foreign companies with a 10% tax facilitation. In Duqm, we already allowed 100% ownership, and we are tax-free. Moreover, we decide our own rate of Omanization, which currently stands at 10%, issue licenses within five days, and provide up to 30 years tax-free. Digital infrastructure is also important to attract investors, which is why we announced many services that we provide through only one system. Through this system, one can apply for registration or investor clearance. Slowly, we are adding other services to be carried out digitally. Before we complete our new business plan, we intend to be fully digitalized. In the sphere of infrastructure development, technology is often associated with smart cities, so it is important to have a vision on how to effectively and efficiently implement smart devices. In this sense, we have already contacted Huawei, Omantel, and Tatweer to create a team that would roll out these plans. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the outbreak of COVID-19 impacted contractors in the Omani energy industry?<br></strong>COVID-19 has impacted the oil and gas contracting industry in two main ways. In the first two months of 2020, the sector suffered from delays to the delivery of equipment and commodities primarily from China, the world's global supply base for contractors in the oil and gas field. Subsequently, supply-chain interruptions continued impacting on construction efforts, since the delayed equipment is the necessary glue that holds our projects together. This situation has generally continued, with a level of improvement as China emerged from the COVID-19 crisis, but in fact was then exacerbated by similar delays from other supply chain countries including Italy and India. Second, the outbreak of COVID-19 had a severe impact on oil and gas demand, pushing energy companies to drive down costs. From previous experiences, the market will likely see the residual impacts of the current lowering of the oil price situation for the next 18-24 months, whilst there are mixed views among many industry observers as to whether the recovery will follow a V- or U-type model. Whatever the form of recovery, adjusting will be paramount, which is why in the short run all players will need to incorporate digital communication practices to optimize and ensure business continuity. At the same time, larger enterprises, such as IOCs, will have to continue to diversify and accelerate their transition to renewable energy products, and smaller companies will also have to rapidly follow suit and diversify their businesses to survive.</p><p><strong>What will be the medium-term outlook of the construction projects in the oil and gas field given the low oil price environment?</strong><br>Since the last oil price slump in 2015/16, liquidity has been an issue across the Middle East, with many governments supporting their economies through injections from their sovereign wealth funds. In Oman, over the last year, there has been a tightening of available credit lines from all sources, which means companies with higher volumes of capital liquidity are better placed to engage in projects and contracts. Moreover, the fall in oil demand has pushed NOCs and IOCs worldwide to put projects on hold or defer them. Project prioritization seems to be the key, for example focusing on developments with a high near-term overall investment return in terms of product and/or financial revenues so that governments can take full advantage of enhanced production as and when the worldwide hydrocarbon market recovers.</p><p><strong>How do you expect COVID-19 to impact the national employment strategy for oil and gas contractors?</strong><br>Governments will likely learn lessons from the COVID-19 experience and adjust their national workforce strategy because of two concurrent trends. On the one hand, companies are completing projects, but there are no new projects and they are hence laying off employees, especially the less qualified, whilst cutting salaries, in pursuit of costs reduction, for those who remain employed. Although a number of lost jobs can be filled by the local national workforce, in some cases they may not have the necessary depth of experience to take full charge of the roles available, although alternatively on-the-job training opportunities may be possible in some examples. On the other hand, due to the current situation, even highly qualified public sector nationals with 25-plus years of experience are in some cases now moving into earlier retirement. These two trends may expand the employment challenge going forward and contribute to elevated unemployment levels, as has been suggested by a number of industry observers.</p><p><strong>In the current macroeconomic environment, companies are forced to accelerate their adoption of innovation. What is your definition of innovation?</strong><br>Innovation in the current environment equates to technology development and looking at different ways to execute projects from an efficiency and cost reduction perspective. It also means executing more efficiently through general digitization and related connected construction systems. Given the reduced margins and increased competition in the aftermath of COVID-19 within the Middle East, innovation will be increasingly aimed at driving costs down. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What challenges does the healthcare sector in Oman face, and how should healthcare providers such as Starcare align their strategic priorities to overcome them?<br></strong>A prolonged low oil price environment may influence the budget, and, therefore, healthcare spending. A good percentage of local patients travel abroad to seek treatment due to a lack of specialized providers and long waiting periods. Limited specialized care in areas such as oncology, cardiac surgeries, and other elective surgical cases are driving outbound medical tourism. Private-sector involvement is becoming imperative to meet the rising demand for healthcare as well as to reduce the burden on government finances. Government policies to increase insurance coverage and provide other infrastructure support are drawing investors to the healthcare sector. Efforts to improve the basic health indicators are leading to a shift from curative to preventive care. The rising prevalence of chronic diseases alongside an anticipated increase in lifestyle disorders is also prompting the need for long-term and post-acute care facilities. Starcare Group operates hospitals in Seeb and Barka as well as large medical centers in Bousher, Duqm, and Samail. The group is rapidly expanding its footprint across Oman, and its Cuddles Women's and Children's Hospital in Al Hail, the first of its kind in Oman, will be operational by mid-2020. Starcare Health City, the largest private hospital in Oman, is another ambitious project and will be functional by 2023.</p><p><strong>The broader health sector is bound to undergo a strong privatization process. What are the main business opportunities for the private sector?</strong><br>Oman's healthcare market is likely to witness a huge transformation. The Ministry of Health is counting on private players to further improve the quality and standard of care in the healthcare sector, thereby opening up new investment opportunities. Oman's healthcare sector is all set for further growth, aided by the introduction of mandatory health insurance for expats. The government has decided to introduce a compulsory health insurance, Dhamani, to create a private healthcare industry capable of meeting the demands of the local market, which will in turn strengthen the private sector. The main purpose of this move is to support the national healthcare industry and create huge opportunities for the medical insurance industry. By the time the schemes of the health insurance are finalized, it will have targeted around 2 million people in Oman.</p><p><strong>What is the key to balancing profitability and affordability in Oman?</strong><br>In Oman, about 45% of the population is made up of expats who work in the private sector. The government's decision to make health insurance mandatory for expats is merely a tool to develop the industry. The introduction of this insurance scheme will provide the required health services to 45% of the population employed in the private sector. The idea is to create a private healthcare industry that can meet the demands of the local market and strengthen the private sector. Over a period of time, the entire population, including Omanis, will have health insurance.</p><p><strong>Where do you expect technological advancements to have the biggest impact?</strong><br>The healthcare industry is at the forefront of technological transformations, with medical and digital technologies assisting in the mitigation and prevention of both communicable and NCDs.  The UAE start-up company, Quanterium Blockchain Solutions, has been one of the principal innovators in the country, using AI, big data, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), blockchain, robotics, and AR and VR to find solutions such as 3D diagnostics, patient records, and other healthcare management platforms. These are in line with global trends, positioning the region as a future leader in this space. AI-based cognitive technologies are proving to be most useful for drug discovery and research, clinical decision support, medical imaging, and diagnostics capabilities. In recent years, the majority of health technology start-ups in the region have focused on radiology solutions, with innovators designing various algorithms that use deep learning to interpret medical images, thereby accurately diagnosing diseases such as breast cancer and tuberculosis. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Have you seen a change in government's requirements in terms of SMEs?<br></strong>The government's policies have been consistent towards SMEs; in fact, it has further strengthened its resolve to implement previous SME policies.  The government's role is to ensure there are mechanisms in place while addressing the challenges of empowering corporations to implement such policies. This is where our Joint Supplier Registration System (JSRS) fits perfectly. As a key enabler of the ICV initiatives wherein the procurement spend is a critical component, we have been witnessing more governmental organizations approaching us to find out how they can better utilize JSRS, with specific reference to the JSRS Contracts Management System (JSRS-CMS) to implement their SME obligation commitments. But empowering and implementing ICV and SME obligations is only one part. The other part is data analytics to monitor the effectiveness of such implementation. JSRS provides strategic analytics functions supporting the government in staying informed of all awarding across the entire supply chain. Monitoring of contract awards for SMEs means ensuring transparency, removing monopolies, and providing equal opportunities to all entities on a level playing field.</p><p><strong>What are the key requirements for this localization strategy to come into effect?<br></strong>Oman is strong in its ICV implementation. That said, there is still a lot of room to strengthen capabilities and opportunities to embrace. One area that Oman lacks is in R&amp;D and innovation; that is where we need to concentrate and allow young Omanis to take risks and jump into business ventures, while ensuring that they have critical knowledge of cutting-edge technologies. They need to fit into a flexible structure and operate within a short-term safety net, potentially provided as part of the government's strategy. The Oman Technology Fund (OTF) plays a leadership role in boosting start-up projects and is doing an excellent job supporting the industry. I hope to see the government further encouraging start-ups. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do things currently stand in Oman's oil and gas market?<br></strong>As Oman is diversifying toward more gas, the challenges become much more significant. We have seen a shift in the government, from “Give me gas" to “What can you offer from a downstream perspective." That utilization of gas will open up an additional market in the Sultanate and the region at large. On the oil side, production challenges are increasing. Most oil comes from mature fields that have been producing for a while beyond their peak, and technology is needed to boost productivity. That is where enhanced oil recovery (EOR) comes in. Production contribution from EOR projects is improving, with a potential for continuous growth in the near future. One big topic is maximizing reservoir contact area by using intelligent well placement and completions. Geosteering technologies, coupled with sub-surface insight, is a key enabler of this goal. It gives us a 3D overview of real-time drilling, enabling optimal well placement in the thinnest reservoirs and access to productive rocks to enhance recovery.</p><p><strong>What are new ways to help achieve the Ministry of Industry's goal to produce 1 million bpd?<br></strong>There are a few ways to do this. The first involves drilling more wells, which means increasing infill activities or looking for new areas to develop. The second is geosteering to maximize the recovery from existing reservoirs, which will become increasingly utilized across Oman. The third aspect of involves the productivity side. Innovative completion and stimulation technologies are increasingly used to improve productivity. We are also cognizant of mitigating major productivity impairment challenges, especially in sandstone reservoirs, due to both increased water and sand production. Another area that is pushing the production envelope is steam injection in heavy oil fields, with a lot of focus on improving the sweep efficiency of existing and future steam flood patterns. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Globally, LPG is expected to have an aggregate growth rate of 3% between 2019 and 2023. Where does Oman stand in terms of this and the energy transition that will push LPG growth?</strong><br>Although LPG is considered by some as a sunset industry, looking at the regional dynamics, especially markets in Asia and Africa, there are still many consumers who are reliant on coal and charcoal. As such, there is a lot of potential in delivering LPG to those consumers and markets that cannot access it currently because of portability and infrastructure issues. LPG will keep growing in the near future. Recent US-China developments have also resulted in many Middle Eastern supplies going to China and other Asian markets that were previously being fed by US supplies, which will continue the growth of the Middle East's LPG industry. Countries like Bangladesh have grown 100% YoY, while Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar will eventually open up. Oman has traditionally supplied the west coast of India and Pakistan. Now that Salalah LPG will allow Oman Gas Company to have its LPG supplies go up in 2020, the remaining 90-95% of the product not destined for local consumption will target Yemen and North Africa.</p><p><strong>Would you map out the latest developments in the gas market in Oman both in terms of growth and segmentation?</strong><br>The Omani market here has not witnessed a significant growth in LPG consumption considering that it is largely a cooking fuel used by households and has limited usage by industry, all because of the market size not being that large. The population of Oman is about 4 million, half expatriates and half locals, with an annual growth of nearly 4% YoY, which is the kind of growth we generally see from a domestic standpoint. New industries are coming up, but not in a substantial way. We have been growing our business, but local business has been pretty stable. The current supply chain model is pretty organized and working well. The National Gas Company has been in discussions with the government for a long time to revise prices and brand cylinders. Unfortunately, we do not have this in Oman yet, unlike most of our neighbors. For example, in the UAE, India, and Pakistan they all have branded cylinders. Each company has its own color cylinder that they are supposed to fill, maintain, and replace.</p><p><strong>Are there likely to be major projects on the infrastructural side that could reshape the Omani market or on the export side with the free zones and port developments?</strong><br>Duqm Port represents a major steppingstone to export products, especially into African markets. Natural gas availability is also increasing in Oman, but every fuel source will continue to exist. In terms of households, Oman spreads horizontally, not vertically, which makes connecting supplies via piped gas networks more difficult and commercially not very feasible. Those networks have not gained much popularity compared to other cities where linking up households via a gas network in large high-rise buildings brings commercial and operational efficiencies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What were the main highlights for Oman LNG in 2019, and how do they reflect the strategy for 2020?<br></strong>The 2019 was challenging but rewarding. First, we achieved 35 million man hours without injuries, which is record-breaking. Second, our production was the highest ever since the start of the company, thanks to our strategic projects and efficiency-driven operation. We have started ambitious projects to increase efficiency and embarked on a gas-engine power project, instead of the open-cycle plant. With our engines just arrived from Europe, we now have nine gas engines. Our new engines, commissioned to start at the end of 2020 or early 2021, will boost our efficiency in power generation from 23% to 46%, making us the first LNG company globally to employ gas engine technology. In addition, we have our plant rejuvenation program to extend our plant's life for another 30 years. We also started producing cargo from the debottlenecking of the plant project, set to be completed by 2021.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the demand side of the market to evolve?<br></strong>In Japan, LNG imports are expected to gradually decrease in the longer term as further nuclear capacity restarts and solar takes some share of energy supply. As such, we compete with the US, Australia, and Qatar, who have increased production. In the meantime, many traders are entering the market and creating confusion with the supply-demand balance and prices. Fortunately, over the last 20 years, we have made strong relationships in the markets and still have clients who prefer to buy directly rather than through traders. On top of that, the China-US trade war and COVID-19 have impacted LNG markets. Therefore, we are currently navigating many risks, while demand from new markets, such as Bangladesh, is not large enough to offset the challenges of East Asia. That being said, we are almost sold out until the end of our concession, while the debottlenecking production is already in the market and receiving a good response.</p><p><strong>How do you expect the LNG gas market partnerships to evolve domestically and internationally?<br></strong>The gas market in Oman is not fully developed, although the government has changed its strategy recently to hedge its risks. Traditionally, the upstream sector had to sell to the government; today, we are expected to use gas to create value-added products and export them, forming an integrated project. We now have gas-to-liquid (GTL) projects with Shell, as well as Total for small-scale LNG bunkering, and more to come with ENI and BP. However, the local market does not pay as well as the international market. LNG usage locally is being developed through Total's small-scale bunkering aimed at developing LNG as fuel for maritime transport. This is a growing sector where LNG provides cleaner and more cost-competitive fuel for shipping; but LNG as fuel for road transport has yet to evolve significantly in many sectors. Locally, we continue to uphold value through building growth opportunities for local organizations leveraging OLNG, such as Oman Shipping Company.</p><p><strong>Where do you expect technological upgrades to improve your processes and plans?<br></strong>Our digital transformation journey will go hand-in-hand with our partner, Shell, and is based on predictive maintenance or predicting when our assets need intervention before they break down. We have obtained thermal predictive data for columns to see when and how the thermal map is changing, giving us foresight on when the process requires change. We are currently doing incident root cause analysis with technology that fast-tracks massive data analysis to enable engineers to pinpoint symptoms and faults faster. We are also looking at automating multiple operations with AI that will enable our staff to focus on different tasks while machines will take care of others. Finally, we continue to adapt our facility's technology to the ever-changing landscape of Oman Gas Grid in order to maximize value. We continue to be agile with upstream development and are preparing ourselves for potential mixed gas blends when upcoming upstream development comes to fruition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has CCED performed in 2019, and how does that reflect the long-term strategy is has embarked on in Oman?<br></strong>In 2019, aside from receiving approval of 10,000sqkm of 3D seismic exploration over the next three to five years, we focused mainly on the optimization of our facilities and on increasing our production levels, exporting, by the end of 2019, over 45,000bpd, the highest levels ever achieved. Overall, our goal is to remain sustainable over the course of our license, which runs through 2040, and become a low-cost operator. The world is changing at an extremely rapid pace, and the energy market needs to adjust accordingly. Environmental footprint, community engagement, and technology transfer are the key pillars of our adjustment strategy. On the environmental side, we launched a project to use gas to generate power for our facilities and camps; and we are using electrical submersible pumps instead of flaring gas. On the technology side, we are using remote access to control our facilities and drone to inspect flare stacks. With regard to community engagement, we introduced an international vocational qualification (IVQ) program to train our technical staff in the field in all disciplines—maintenance people, electrical technicians, and operators, and we are looking at local graduate recruitment as well. The educational system here certainly sets Oman up for this, so we just need to provide the right industrial training.</p><p><strong>Where does Oman stand in terms of energy transition?<br></strong>Oman needs to start managing its energy needs in a more sustainable way, striking the right balance between renewables and oil and gas. A substantial change in the Omani energy landscape will come over the next couple of years with the growing importance of gas, and OQ's gas infrastructure will play a role in this. In terms of renewables, solar is viable, despite some technical challenges, but it makes sense for large IOCs to diversify. In the local market, there is still a place for the smaller operators who are focused on being the best in their space and, through the assistance of the operators, more local contractors will be working at high professional standards and will be capable to compete in the international market by the level of service, provision, and technical skills they are bringing to the table.</p><p><strong>What will be the major challenges within five years' time?<br></strong>We are currently comfortable with the country's regulatory environment. Nevertheless, we are uncertain what changes the new regime will bring and how everything will align with regional politics. Oil prices and oil demand are also a matter of concern, not only today with the current COVID-19 issue, but also in the medium term as a result of the change in industrial output from China as well. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the current environment impacting Al Anwar Holding, and what opportunities lie in the private equity sector?<br></strong>Both the GCC and Oman offer plenty of opportunities for private equity investments, as the government is now trying to encourage the private sector to assume a bigger role. This is clear from the PPP Law and the government's plan to diversify the economy. At present, it is a buyers' market as valuations are low, and the stock market has been going down for the last three years, with a lot of foreign investors pulling out of Oman. If we had more funds available, we would buy a number of companies in our chosen clusters. For this reason, we are looking at various other options such as bringing in strategic investors to support this expansion through additional funding. When we look at investments, we prefer those with good corporate governance. This explains why 90% of our investments are in listed companies. Second, we look at leading companies, especially those with an innovative and forward-looking approach. Oman is a small market, so any major project that is set up here will have to focus on exports. At Al Anwar Holding, we are seeking to capitalize on the opportunities in Oman; our strategy is to invest only in the Sultanate for the next three years. We have made direct investments in the manufacturing, financial services, and education sectors, and we are looking to expand into the healthcare sector in the near future. </p><p><strong>How can innovation be applied across the business model of your portfolio companies?<br></strong>Innovation can be applied at four levels: operational, business development, management, and human capital. Companies have to innovate and use technology and new ideas such as automation to go to the next level. AI is just one way to improve the production process. The youth today uses different methods of communications such as social media, so we have to change our marketing approach. It is crucial for CEOs and management to get the correct information and quickly decide. Finally, innovation needs to be applied to the human capital aspect of a company, especially because retaining talent has become a challenge.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations in the short to medium term, and what factors are necessary to increase the depth and performance of the market?</strong><br>Performance has not been good over the last three years as a number of investors have pulled out of the market, which is not a good sign. Companies are trading below book value today. One of the reasons is the link between the stock market, oil prices, and the geopolitical situation. The depth and liquidity in our stock market needs to be increased, as well the pace of decision-making. Most players who enter the market want an option to exit; however, investors such as ours, who are there for a longer period, do not get too affected by the stock market. The Omani market is a highly dividend-oriented market and not too geared toward capital appreciation.</p><p><strong>What are your priorities for 2020?<br></strong>Our priority is to continue focusing on our four clusters. In the manufacturing cluster, we are trying to create an open-ended SPV that will hold all the investment in manufacturing companies and then offload 40% to the international strategic investors. These investments will not only bring financial returns, but innovation, technology, and new markets. In particular, we are seeking investors who already have a manufacturing appetite. Moreover, we want to diversify the range of products within the same manufacturing companies to offer the customer more choice and gain more market share. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is your approach to localization and adding value to the Omani business environment?<br></strong><strong>ALI SULEYM AL JUNAIBI</strong> Al Ghalbi International seeks to capitalize on our years of experience in Oman, but also to learn from other countries. We are keen to share our knowledge with some international companies and also work for some other as an agency in Oman. Al Ghalbi started as a small company, and step by step we increased our capabilities and quality of services, positioning ourselves as a key player in the industry. In terms of capabilities, we seek to maintain all our operations in-house, including design. This localization approach will help not only our company, but also the whole country to reduce its reliance on international players and services, while at the same time raising the level of our employees. In 1998, when we started operations, there were five employees; today, we have around 760. We want everyone who works for us to feel like they are part of one team. Placing employees at the heart of our organization led to where we are today, and we plan on keeping this strategy in the future.</p><p><strong>What is required to reach the standard where Oman is competitive and has a fully integrated supply chain from raw materials to export?<br></strong><strong>K</strong><strong>HALID AL JASMI </strong>First, we need excellent planning and need to gather all the information required to determine what materials can be produced for multiple industries and stakeholders to save costs. This will lead to the creation of a new industry that can cater to the demands of different sectors. Then, we need a commitment from these sectors to buy from that new industry. We also need to ensure the costs are low enough to bring competitive prices. Our market is around 5%, which is low. Recently, the US-China trade war affected the price of steel, and it was being dumped in other countries, though not in Oman. That means it is reflecting back on us. Globalization makes the world like a small village because developments in other countries can affect us and we cannot do anything about it. That is where one is cornered and has to go with losses.</p><p><strong>How is your future strategy aligned with Vision 2040?<br></strong><strong>ASAJ</strong> Oil will continue to play an important role in Oman's economy for years to come, but it will require new technologies, which we have already started adopting, such as Oxy Free, which we have brought from the UK. It decreases pipe corrosion, prolonging the lifespan of pipes by more than 20 years. We are setting up four more companies under the Al Ghalbi umbrella. One of these companies will be a global company, part of which is a big factory in Oman called Duqm Salt. We have already secured contracts until 2030 with Occidental, PDO, and Halliburton and have started production. We also established a transport company called Al Kadara. We have built two camps and a motel for the staff. We will provide everything including food, service, laundry, Wi-Fi, and TV. In 2020, we are focusing on Duqm and building a 20,000-sqm, five-star hotel there. Everything is in order; we are expecting to find suitable investors and enter the construction phase in the near future. We will later gain approval to use a 30,000-sqm space in Duqm port to build a warehouse. One of the items we plan to store there is salt. Given the scale of the project, we will employ state-of-the-art systems and technologies to ensure efficiency.</p><p><strong>What does it mean for Triangle Engineering to be innovative and remain ahead of the curve to jump on the next economic cycle?</strong><br><strong>KAJ</strong> We have been working on an ERP system to reduce our headcount. We have also considered going into automation, as manufacturing and manpower is costly. As such, we have been approaching different companies to bring robotics. Currently, we are still not utilizing around 50% of our capacity in terms of the assets and manpower, so there is no justification to go for robotics. As for sourcing, we are looking at different markets and where we can go to the source long term. The long-term strategy would be to produce on our own instead of sourcing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How will the COVID-19 pandemic impact Oman's economy in general and the Islamic banking sector in specific?<br></strong>The pandemic is not only an immense health crisis, but also an imminent restructuring of the global economic order. Despite efforts to contain it, the outbreak has had far-reaching consequences. Public health measures to slow the spread of the contagion, such as social distancing, have turned to be effective, but at the same time such measures have blocked the flow of goods and hindered the economy. As a result, economic contagion is spreading as fast as the disease itself. Oman's government took prompt actions, which is why the numbers in Oman are well under control compared to other regional countries. The central bank made the necessary adjustments to provide much-needed support to banks. Moving forward, Oman's diversification plans will provide much-needed stimulus to the economy in 2020 and beyond.</p><p><strong>Oman is set to enter a new economic cycle characterized by the financing of long-term infrastructure projects, privatization, PPPs, and SMEs. What opportunities will this economic environment generate for the Islamic banking sector?</strong><br>Oman is maintaining sustainable growth, following the new reforms and governmental initiatives to diversify sources of revenue while increasing spending in key sectors. In the face of unprecedented global challenges, the country has remained steady and resilient in creating new opportunities in a wide variety of sectors. Infrastructure projects, traditionally financed by the government because of their huge investments, need to find funds from alternative sources to fill in the financing gaps brought by budget deficits and increasing public debt. Our solution to this funding gap is represented by sukuks (sharia-compliant bonds), so that investors in infrastructure projects have the option of either directly investing in a project or buying project sukuk. Aside from sukuks, the Islamic banking sector can assist investors with a range of different solutions, such as advisory in structuring the deal and financing through appropriate trade financing facilities. The central bank has already identified Islamic interest, which is an advantage coming into the market. Oman is a relatively smaller market, and liquidity is a concern, but fluctuation in the Oman market is less than others, which entails less risk.<br><br><strong>Which commercial sectors are you looking at for medium-term credit growth?</strong><br>There are numerous sectors expecting growth, such as manufacturing, tourism, logistics, mining, fisheries, infrastructure, and trade. The banking sector will thus seek to capitalize on its resilience to sustain the economic backdrop, together with the support of the authorities committed to implementing a series of new initiatives to ensure a gradual fiscal consolidation. In this sense, a bank's risk-management strategies play a crucial role. Bank Nizwa's approach, for example, is focused on the selection of clients and being specific on its project's cash assignments. Our strategy is to go into more secured credit and sacrifice the profitability. Moreover, the government is bringing some companies under one public umbrella. In 2021 and 2022, this will be our area of focus, along with increasing the limit of credit line from USD35 million to USD100 million.</p><p><strong>Where do you see avenues for growth in the medium term, and what factors will drive them?<br></strong>Our goal is to take Bank Nizwa and the whole Islamic finance industry to a higher level. To do so, we are consistently growing our bottom line and market share and setting strategic priorities on asset quality, liquidity, profitability, and efficiency. Our total assets grew by 19% in 2019, reaching OMR1.03 billion from OMR872 million in 2018, while our total customer deposit portfolio reached OMR797 million, achieving a growth of 11% YoY. We also had to increase our efficiency through re-engineering and revisiting processes. As a result, we have a plan for digitalization, which will include upgrading our core banking system and bringing more enhancements to the way customers can reach the bank. Looking at the longer term, we are planning on increasing the number of customers outside Oman's borders, both high-net-worth-individuals and institutional players. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How are digital services shaping the traditional retail and wholesale banking sector?<br></strong>The customer-centric business model is always vital for the growth and profitability of the banking sector, regardless of the changing contours of delivery modes. The increasing digitalization in banking has improved the pace, scale, scope, and ease of both retail and wholesale banking services over the last few years. At the same time, it has led to increased efficiency and productivity in the banking sector, in turn, reducing the cost of conducting business. The technological innovation driven by ever-evolving customer expectations and the quest for improving business processes has paved the way for increased digitalization in the banking sector globally. Notably, the banking sector in Oman has always been a front-runner in adopting new ideas, technologies, and business models to provide hassle-free banking services to customers. Banks in Oman have implemented cutting-edge technologies, such as internet banking, mobile banking, and so on, and are currently exploring new technologies such as blockchain and AI.</p><p><strong>How can the Omani banking sector fully capitalize on the opportunities brought by infrastructure projects, new PPPs, and SMEs?</strong><br>As part of efficient and prudent financial intermediation, banks always have to look for sound and viable projects for funding. CBO, on its part, ensures that there is adequate liquidity in the system and banks remain robust and resilient to meet the credit requirements of all segments without undermining financial stability. Currently, there is ample scope in the banking sector to provide for higher credit to different segments of the economy. The reduction in the minimum capital adequacy ratio by 1% in 2019 and measures announced recently in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as 50% reduction in Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) to 1.25%, increase in lending ratio from 87.5% to 92.5%, and reduction in interest rates on standing facilities would ease credit conditions considerably. Therefore, given the availability of credit, banks should be willing to explore the credit opportunities being offered by infrastructure projects, new PPPs, and SMEs. Recent government policies including the promulgation of key legislations related to foreign investment, PPP, privatization, and bankruptcy, among others, would also create opportunities for banks to extend credit.</p><p><strong>How can Oman's banking sector help make the Sultanate a destination for international investors and funds?<br></strong>A healthy and resilient banking sector is necessary to ensure financial stability and growth, and attract international investors. Oman's banking sector has been displaying robustness and resilience over the years. Omani banks are equipped with state-of-the-art technologies and excellent human capital resources, which enable them to provide banking services that are at par with multinational banks. The banking sector in Oman is well-poised to support the country in attracting international investors and funds.</p><p><strong>What are CBO's strategic priorities for 2021, and what will be the main macroeconomic factors driving them?<br></strong>In its pursuit to support growth and ensure financial stability in the Sultanate, CBO will continue to strive for a healthy and strong banking sector that is able to provide quality banking services to all segments. Furthermore, CBO will respond to the evolving macroeconomic conditions in a proactive manner so that the intended objectives are achieved while ensuring the sector's resilience. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CBO announced a slew of measures to ensure adequate liquidity in the system, ease credit conditions, and provide temporary and timely relief to borrowers. CBO is also engaged in improving financial outreach and banking services. A fintech set up has been constituted to study, recommend, and oversee the establishment and development of the CBO's fintech agenda, which will feed into the aspired Oman agenda. CBO has also formed an internal taskforce that is actively working with the concerned institutions to adopt new Industry 4.0 technologies. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the retail and marine fuel market develop in 2019, and what main trends are you focusing on in 2020?<br></strong>For the past two years, the fuel market in Oman has witnessed a slowdown, impacting all players, though we have endured, thanks to our strategy launched three years ago while focusing on four pillars. Our first pillar is global expansion with the exploration of opportunities beyond Oman's borders: we have since entered the markets of Saudi Arabia and Tanzania. Our second pillar is to increase our fuel market share in Oman, which we have continuously done through introducing unique integrated service hubs and transforming the fuel industry with our innovative products and services. Regarding lubricants in Oman, we have increased our sales volume by 36% in 2019 on a decreasing lubricants market, thus evidencing our growth strategy. Given the company's strategic interest in the ships bunker fuel business, OOMCO is now constructing a greenfield bunker terminal in the Port of Duqm. This terminal will consist of 30,000m³ capacity tankage, pipelines, pump sets, valves, electrical and mechanical equipment. The terminal will be fully commissioned by the end of 1Q2020: the project timing is broadly aligned with the development and construction of the Duqm Refinery for fuel supply and associated shipping, which will further grow our customer base.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy to grow the commercial segment of the fuel industry?<br></strong>In B2B, we go beyond the default commodity sales concept: we provide our strategic partners with more and better solutions. We focus on delivery efficiency, using advanced systems that are fast, secure, and transparent, and target problem-free experiences for our customers. Our customers are at the core of our operations; that is why we keep introducing innovative solutions like mobile fuel stations, commercial applications, and e-Fill. Aviation is another major source of fuel consumption beyond COVID-19 impacting the global economy and industry.</p><p><strong>What role will technology play in shifting the industry to further innovation and sustainability?<br></strong>We are working on new concepts of service stations. OOMCO is already ahead in adopting sustainability practices as the first fuel marketing company to go eco-friendly in the Sultanate. We have introduced this first green service station at Rusayl, which comprises of a range of unique eco-friendly features including solar panels, LED lights, a vapor recovery system (VRS), and an electric vehicle (EV) charger. Meanwhile, our chain of 110 Ahlain convenience stores offers biodegradable bags instead of plastic ones. In 2021, we will continue to expand our smart fueling offering, expanding ways of digital access to our customers. We launched our OOMCO World app, which brings together products and services offered in our service stations into one rewarding and convenient experience for all customers. We believe cashless is the way to go, and our customers will be able recharge our new “Basma Plus" smart fuel card online and enjoy one of the fastest payment experiences.</p><p><strong>How should oil marketing companies position themselves with shaping the industry of the future?<br></strong>In order to become customer-centric, the first step is to embrace the term “service station" instead of “gas station" or “filling station." The key is to offer a real experience through service hubs to customers so that they will come back and stay longer: our service stations are becoming “destinations." In this sense, we are introducing a new concept, the MEGA service station, where people come not just for fuel, but to find entertainment, a hair salon, a car services workshop, and so on, within a 10,000-sqm service station. The goal is to get passengers outside the cars. We believe in growing the non-fuel retail through our shops, food, and services<br>activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the strategic priorities of the Oman Chamber of Commerce in 2020, and what factors are driving those priorities?<br></strong>The government and the chamber in particular have always played a wide array of roles since their inception, but Vision 2040 is looking to empower the private sector in particular. This means the private sector will be given a leadership role to start operating independently from the government. Most interestingly, by 2040, the government will have a full economic digital transformation, and all investments leading to this digitization are underway. However, in order for an economic digitization to happen, the chamber should restructure itself to be prepared for all the challenges as well as opportunities. For that reason, the chamber is now in the process of creating its first strategy. The first is to empower the private sector to fit Vision 2040 by supporting digital technology and innovation. This new step the chamber is taking will certainly bring a new organizational structure, new teams, and, most importantly, a new culture.</p><p><strong>What is required for this transition of publicly owned assets to go into the hands of the private sector in a sustainable way?</strong><br>First, we will increase the number of functional managers with specialists wherever necessary. Then, we will appoint vice presidents and directors, who will have more operational duties rather than administrative. In addition, a 2017 royal decree put the chamber's laws in place, outlining the role of the chamber, its mandate, and how the board is elected. In that way, the chamber must always be consulted by public and private sectors when putting forth new laws, addressing challenges by the private sector, the Omanization program, and exports and imports.</p><p><strong>Where do you see the main challenges in consulting in Omani society today?<br></strong>The current status quo of the economy created challenges that led to a lack of liquidity, both globally and locally, as well as an imbalance in the the supply and demand for Omani products. The two challenges add up to another main challenge, which is creating new job opportunities. For this reason, we want Omani companies to have a global reach in foreign markets by creating a network in the global market through B2B, exhibitions, and other marketing initiatives. We are also seeking to use e-channel platforms that will help remove restrictions present in the market and allow us to produce products that can reach a global scale. Finally, the chamber will have an active role in company registration, producing production licensing, and conducting the necessary training for businesses that require it.</p><p><strong>What is the key for family businesses in the changing economy and in targeting KPIs for Vision 2040?<br></strong>Family businesses are one of the main economic drivers in emerging economies. When we discovered oil, and liquidity flowed into the market, some people took the opportunity and started their own business. The challenge now lies in transforming this opportunity and extending it to the next generation. It is quite challenging to do, and different tools have been used such as IPOs, boards and trustees, and standardization of governance procedures to ensure long-term sustainability.</p><p><strong>What strategic direction is Oman taking in 2020, and why should foreign investors be watching it closely?<br></strong>If we look at Oman's history since 1970, there has been a great deal of cumulative learning experiences. We have many successes and failures, but we learn from our experiences. We are aiming to diversify our economy away from oil because we are part of the global economy and its market dynamics. We cannot be sure we will do it perfectly, but it is extremely important to plan ahead to make Vision 2040 a success story, by ensuring fairness, transparency, and good utilization of resources. </p>]]></richbody0content>
