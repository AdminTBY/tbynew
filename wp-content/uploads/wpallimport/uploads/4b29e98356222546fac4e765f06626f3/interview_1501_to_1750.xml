		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the evolution of DI, and how are you aligning with the broader visions of the Emirate?<br></strong>DI was established in 2004 to accelerate growth in manufacturing and logistics and unlock new opportunities in the Emirate's economy. Our strategic location plays a vital role in developing the industrial area outside of the city. We contribute to Dubai's industrial growth by providing a cost-effective business ecosystem with industrial land, warehousing facilities, and well-equipped worker accommodation with supermarkets, healthcare centers, mosques, and sports facilities. The infrastructure creates a community and commercial hub for international and local manufacturers and traders to establish their business and support goals underpinned by the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030. This includes a sharper focus on the industrial light manufacturing industry to help the Emirate increase exports, reduce imports, and build a sustainable, diversified economy.</p><p><strong>Which subsectors in industrial light manufacturing are you emphasizing?<br></strong>We have an excellent urban design in DI that focuses on six zones: food and beverage; chemicals; base metals; minerals; machinery equipment; and transport. We also have supporting zones for logistics and light manufacturing. This attractive masterplan assures companies that their operations will not be interrupted, while our diverse mix of business partners helps manufacturers find suppliers in one of our six zones to build an integrated, localized supply chain.</p><p><strong>How do you ensure you can sustainably cater to the CAPEX demands across all these zones?<br></strong>This was a consideration when we developed the masterplan and we have established certain power limits for our zones. Based on the masterplan, we have allocated different needs for transport, water, and energy. We also control demand for additional power through an application and evaluation process. In 2018, we invested in covering new zones and new infrastructure requirements. We have the flexibility investors need to customize their infrastructure. With some of our partners, we know what they want from the start and work hard to support them early on and in challenging times to ensure<br>we thrive together.</p><p><strong>What is your philosophy around financial sustainability for the industrial zone?<br></strong>We are proud of our business ecosystem and continue it build with focus and efficiency. We are developing 550 million sqft of land step-by-step to be sustainable. We maintain strong relationships with the more than 730 business partners at DI, who are our ambassadors in the market. We also have a comprehensive expenditure plan and invested in four substations for total of 800MW capacity. We also continually monitor our power capacity to ensure we can meet our business partners' energy demands now and in the future. We also invest in digital transformation, automation, and renewable energy to reduce operational costs for our partners and create an environment that supports organic growth.</p><p><strong>How are you building your strategy around automation processes?<br></strong>We have 140 operational factories in DI, and automation is an increasingly important part of the mix; however, factories still need workers and the rise of automation presents an opportunity for employers to retrain staff and help them develop new skills as businesses expand their use of machine learning and robotics.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for your industrial hub for the coming decade?<br></strong>We are the main stakeholder in the Dubai Industrial Strategy 2030 and work closely with Dubai Exports, the co-lead of the strategy, to help our business partners drive manufacturing and logistics innovation. By developing world-class infrastructure and providing partners with end-to-end solutions to enhance ease of doing business with online access to government and visa services, we create an ecosystem for players in the light and medium manufacturing sectors to thrive. DI contributes to Dubai's status as a sustainable, technologically advanced manufacturing hub that helps multinational corporations and local entrepreneurs across food and beverage, base metals, transport equipment, machinery, logistics, chemicals, and minerals contribute to the Emirate's economic success story. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of your operations in the UAE and the defining features of your relationship with the country? </strong><br>Veolia is a French-listed company and world leader in the environmental business, with three main activities: water, waste, and energy. Veolia Middle East has supported the public sector and industries to meet their biggest challenges in terms of resources efficiency, growth, compliance, workforce safety, and digitalization. As the global leader in optimized resources management, Veolia Middle East is committed to delivering innovative, cost-effective, and sustainable solutions to its clients. We are both developers and operators. We have more than 1,000 patents for specific water-treatment solutions. In the UAE, the majority of our business is related to desalination and wastewater treatment. Within the energy division, we are experts in energy efficiency and the management of energy production facilities for several industries. This expertise also includes steam production, heat production, cooling, and energy management in buildings. Furthermore, we manage energy efficiency specifications for buildings, including malls.</p><p><strong>How do government policies concerning various aspects of energy, waste, and water management influence your business models? </strong><br>The water business is driven by the government and has minimal influence on Veolia's business model. Waste management is slightly different as it is still growing because of the boom in the UAE, and with the continuous increase in population, the government needs assistance to structure the market. We aim to find the most appropriate business model, making sure that the investment tax requested by the government is reduced as much as possible by recovering waste to create recycled raw materials. Moving forward, with the population increasing across the region, waste will probably be the biggest challenge; therefore, we must be innovative and deliver solutions to help the government convert waste to new resources. This is called the circular economy and it involves creating local value chains that engage a broad range of stakeholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you outline some of your projects, and how the unique solar leasing model can be expanded upon in Dubai South and beyond?<br></strong>As the adoption of solar projects gains momentum in the UAE and the region, South Energy remains committed to driving the adoption of clean and renewable energy sources to contribute to the achievement of sustainability goals. Our first solar project was completed recently, and the second, third, and fourth projects are currently progressing. Our projects in the pipeline, amounting to 50MWp, are in different stages, ranging from tender and award to design and execution. Based on a 360-degree approach, we embark on our energy projects after conducting a thorough assessment of the demand and supply landscape. We are currently installing a 2-MWp roof solar system for Dubai South headquarters and four freight complex buildings. Our commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals is reflected in every step, and our efforts to contribute to the diversification of the country's energy resources are in line with the UAE Vision 2021. In terms of projects being executed for other customers and sister companies, we continue to offer consultancy services to an array of customers on various aspects including design, feasibility, and commercial viability. We also help them decide whether to buy or lease.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on the energy management system and command center you have implemented at Dubai South?<br></strong>Rather than the conventional approach adopted by many companies that focus on the accounting of resources management and the implementation of measures before discovering their impacts on costs, we adopt a real-time analysis, and assess our performance through hourly, daily, and weekly profiles. Our district cooling plants and buildings are all integrated and are connected to one system. In addition, an hourly analysis of the performance gives us a holistic overview, thereby helping us monitor the equipment as well. Through the interconnectivity of all equipment in the building and the collection of data from more than 200,000 sensors, the system capitalizes on the potential of big data in building connectivity, which enhances its energy efficiency many folds. Through gaining a deep understanding of the building's performance by analyzing the data collected, we were able to make several necessary changes. As a result, we continue to enhance the system with the development of new infrastructure, including fiber-optic connectivity.</p><p><strong>How does South Energy see its role in the energy sector, and what position do you want to take?<br></strong>Through the delivery of holistic energy solutions that include district cooling, solar, and retrofits, South Energy is set to become a market leader that leads the change from the forefront. Our systems help customers monitor consumption rates and behaviors and enable them to make necessary changes and implement required measures. Our achievements and projects in this regard allow us to drive the change, paving the way for other energy companies to follow suit. Redesigning before the installation of large systems can add immense value to energy efficiencies. In view of the constant evolution of the market, companies will have to enhance their sustainability and efficiencies in order to survive. Unsustainable and inefficient companies will eventually be left behind if they are not willing to adapt to change and remodel themselves.</p><p><strong>What are your next bold steps, and what is your vision for South Energy?<br></strong>Besides moving forward with the existing projects, we are also challenging the market by building the first distributed centralized energy stations for district cooling. The development of the first two projects will prove that huge energy stations and district cooling plants are not necessary. The development of smaller modular plants will make the provision cheaper for customers. Simultaneously, we are developing solar solutions that offer more competitive rates, which will substantially drive adoption. Dubai is different from Europe with regard to its energy efficiency approach, as we focus more on not wasting resources and becoming sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is DMCA integrating technologies and innovation to enhance Dubai's leading position in the maritime sector? <br></strong>DMCA aims to promote innovation as a cornerstone for enhancing the competitiveness, attractiveness, and comprehensiveness of the maritime community and elevate Dubai to the ranks of the world's leading maritime capitals. The Dubai Maritime Virtual Cluster is a platform that embodies DMCA's commitment to instilling a culture of creativity and innovation as an integral part of the process of building a renewed, safe and sustainable marine sector. As a smart knowledge and research platform, it facilitates the work of recreational marine means and activities as a key element in driving the growth of the tourism sector in Dubai, with a focus on establishing high-quality tourism facilities and creating new jobs within the marine leisure sector. The initiative is an innovative concept designed to enhance the ease, efficiency, and quality of providing a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of marine services to marine investors from around the world, as well as building constructive partnerships and positive participation of maritime sector leaders through the virtual presence mechanism. The Smart Mobile Service is at the forefront of the innovative marine initiatives, which have contributed to the successive achievements of DMCA on the path of intelligent transformation, seeking to facilitate access to government services for the benefit of customers and the maritime community. Under the Smart Mobile Service initiative, we have developed a smart car equipped with state-of-the-art technology to deliver mobile services, including a mobile smart maritime center that provides self-service. Furthermore, the initiative aims to develop innovative solutions in line with Dubai's plans to transform into a smart city with the world's best technology infrastructure.</p><p><strong>How will DMCA capitalize on the opportunities offered by Expo 2020? <br></strong>DMCA and Expo Dubai have affirmed their commitment to utilize the potential available to build a safe, renewable, and sustainable maritime sector in line with the economic diversification plans of Dubai and the rest of the UAE. Maritime Week presents a world-class platform to promote the exchange of knowledge, expertise, and best practices, while enhancing the local maritime sector's attractiveness, efficiency, and competitiveness, especially after Dubai was named one of the best maritime capitals in the world in 2019.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the maritime sector's contribution to Dubai's broader economy? <br></strong>Dubai moved up in the ranking of the world's top-five maritime centers in 2019. The same year, Dubai was ranked first in the Middle East and ninth in the world among the top maritime capitals. Maintaining the fifth position among the leading international maritime centers motivates us to continue our efforts to further enhance Dubai's competitiveness in the global maritime landscape. Recent reports show an increase in the number of offshore companies, from 5,500 in 2016 and 6,655 in 2017 to 7,400 in 2018. Currently 13,000 maritime and investment activities have led to the creation of 76,000 jobs. In 2019, the maritime sector witnessed a remarkable boom as Dubai's maritime industry accounted for 7% of the total GDP.</p><p><strong>As we approach a new decade, what is your vision for DMCA? <br></strong>The remarkable progress made by Dubai as one of the world's best maritime capitals for 2019 is not surprising, as it serves as a continuation of the path to become number one in the world. DMCA's focus on innovation to advanced infrastructure and legislation ensures the highest standards of efficient maritime operations, occupational safety, and environmental practices. We will continue implementing an integrated and impactful portfolio of initiatives to enhance the sector's competitiveness and guarantee its contributions to the country's sustainable growth and economic diversification strategy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of Dragon Oil and its core priorities?<br></strong>Dragon Oil is an international oil and gas exploration, development, and production company. Our main business task is to ensure that we have cash positive bottom-line results. Change management has to be positive for Dragon Oil, especially in an industry like oil and gas, which is continuously transforming. Dragon Oil has a collaborative approach; we like to problem solve and create value through synergy and integration. We have significant operations in Turkmenistan with our principal producing asset at Cheleken, in the eastern section of the Caspian Sea. This was our first overseas base established 20 years ago. We are the 100% owner and operator of the concession jointly in the Cheleken oilfield with the government of Turkmenistan. Due to our success there, we have established an excellent reputation in the industry. We bring substantial technical competence to our operations. Wherever we operate, we always consider ourselves strategic partners of the government and the country.</p><p><strong>What are some of the important technologies that you are exploring?<br></strong>The complexities of some of our operating environments mean that innovative technologies have excellent use cases. We have already applied AI to the Cheleken field, where, owing to the structural dynamics of some of these floating assets, we have seen several notable benefits. Much of the data gathered helps us to uncover efficiencies. Machine learning allows us to increase the accuracy of prediction through AI. This is a dual-pronged approach, as we depend on machine learning, and grow in parallel with this technology. Newer technologies such as smart field applications for automation will disrupt the sector even further, as they become more advanced, especially when we deploy methods of transferring data in real time both for drilling, production, and maintenance. As an organization, we strictly follow the major trends within technology. We want to remain current and not miss the pace of development. Company-wide, we have been training more of our workforce in technology disciplines that will be fundamental for the new energy era.<br><br><strong>What does the overall global shift toward gas and renewable energy mean for Dragon Oil?<br></strong>From an operational level, at this stage, we want to diversify our portfolio within energy to include more gas. Turkmenistan would be an excellent place to begin this. We can leverage on our current network and local industry knowledge to develop competencies in areas such as gas transportation, treatment options, gas to liquid, LPG and LNG, and petrochemicals. This would complement our existing oil and gas business. The energy mix is a journey, and it is up to the industry as a whole to improve the combination. Supply and demand dynamics will obviously feature heavily in the future. Gas will be the transitioning agent, as it is mobile and typically complies with international regulations. Clean energy is undoubtedly growing, and it will be interesting to see how much we can generate from solar and wind in the years ahead. However, it is also important to note that oil and gas will be a mainstay in the years ahead. In the Emirates, we are fortunate as we have not only an abundance of hydrocarbons but also remarkable solar potential.</p><p><strong>What is your strategic vision for Dragon Oil over the next decade?<br></strong>We aim to double our production; this will be our primary strategic objective for the next few years. Another of our goals is to develop the next generation of oil and gas professionals. Technology serves as a means to attract more young people to the industry, and technological adoption will also remain a priority for us over the next decade. Moreover, I see Dragon Oil becoming more active throughout its network. We are well established and can play a significant role in combining our efforts with our partners to develop greater efficiencies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How does sustainability factor into Chevron's operations and approach to business in an evolving energy sector?<br></strong>As a corporation, Chevron is committed to addressing the risks of climate change while delivering sustainable energy benefits to people. We work with policymakers in various parts of the world to address environmental concerns and ensure we have affordable, reliable, and clean energy. In addition, we find innovative ways to meet global energy demand with advanced technologies in the oil and gas space. Our goals reflect the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including our work to enable human progress and help solve global challenges.</p><p><strong>How do you balance such sustainability targets with the significant growth in energy demand in this region?<br></strong>In this part of the world, we are more predominantly active in the downstream space. In the downstream segment, we have channel markets, and one of the main channels for us in this region is aviation, specifically jet fuel. We also work with Dubai Airports on finding more areas where we can contribute toward its long-term sustainability plans and making ourselves visible as an oil company supporting the nation's goal of moving toward a sustainable energy solution within the jet space. Similarly, we look for cleaner energy solutions in relation to our finished lubricant products. Within shipping and the bunker fuel space, the regulations are already changing, and Chevron follows the regulators to make sure we are ready for example, with new low-sulfur spec fuel. Chevron is preparing regionally to comply.</p><p><strong>In addition to driving environmental progress, Chevron is driving human progress. How does this relate to enhancing diversity and inclusion?</strong><br>Diversity and inclusion are two of Chevron's integral values. We consciously and intentionally cultivate a diverse culture where employees can bring their best self to work. This practice fuels high performance within our company. Personally, this is close to my heart because I have participated in several employee engagement networks during my 24 years at Chevron. We strive to treat everyone fairly and give everyone a fair chance, achieving gender parity across the organization. Chevron has adopted Catalyst's Men Advocating Real Change (MARC) program, and we have won awards for it several times. In the Middle East, we just launched our Dubai MARC chapter in September 2019. It is all about men being the real advocates for women because we cannot create sustainable change without engaging men at the senior management and board level. Chevron has MARC chapters all around the globe. Chevron in Dubai is a diverse group. We have about 60 people in this office from 23 nationalities. It is not a zero-sum game for us. We want to put people at ease to deliver their best every day.</p><p><strong>How is Chevron leading the charge in advancing innovation and future forward technologies?<br></strong>At present, we are transforming the way we work at Chevron. Digital innovation is paramount, and we are actively using digital technology to drive more value across the entire organization. Digital innovation is about empowering our people to make better and faster decisions. We are also leveraging new technologies to make faster and better decisions, giving us an edge to compete for the future. Digital acceleration is one of our key strategic imperatives. Our approach to digital innovation includes top-down support that goes all the way down from our CEO and senior executives. We have a dedicated team working to ensure this cascades down to every aspect of our business and every country where we operate. We have to change the way we do things, and I believe we are. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the significance of Dubai and the UAE for Baker Hughes?<br></strong>The UAE is a key country for our business and is our key partner. We have developed many business models with ADNOC and the UAE, with a presence in Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi is the oil and gas hub for the UAE, while Dubai is the hub for everything else, including our regional headquarters. Our Dubai facility is home to one of our global training centers and a manufacturing facility. One of the main advantages of our headquarters in Dubai is the greater ease of doing business and its central location in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. Our access to markets, both developed and growing, is unparalleled. Dubai and Abu Dhabi are two sides of the same coin. When people think of the UAE, they think of Dubai because of its reputation for innovation, openness, and accessibility; Abu Dhabi brings a great deal of weight in terms of cash reserves and its financial sector.</p><p><strong>What are the impacts of your significant investments in the UAE?<br></strong>Our investment in the UAE is part of our footprint in the country—a total surface area of around 70,000sqm. This includes offices, a training center, and a manufacturing facility. In terms of presence, we have about 500 employees in Dubai and another 300-400 in Abu Dhabi. Our presence, in terms of workforce, facilities, and activities demonstrates how important the UAE is to us. In terms of actual out-of-pocket investments, we established a partnership in 2018 with ADNOC. We made an investment where we took a 5% equity stake in ADNOC Drilling, which was an injection of USD550 million, a major investment. When we decided to take on a partnership, our decision was with ADNOC. </p><p><strong>How does Baker Hughes work with Dubai to spur innovation?<br></strong>Dubai has been and remains a center of innovation. The city is ahead of other cities in terms of how people think and implement bold ideas. The things that have been done here are incredible. Dubai has been encouraging an open dialog and bringing together different players. Being in Dubai has been a great way to attract talent, including the best minds in all sectors. We spend large sums of money on R&amp;D, but it is not all in one place. We have research centers all over the globe. We launched initiatives such as the VitalyX real-time lubricant monitoring system with ENOC. This way, we can perform our research not only in our labs, but also with our customers. If there is a problem, we can join forces with a customer to develop a solution and transform our approach to innovation. Innovation is not just about technology; it also encompasses innovative commercial models. We try to be more focused on outcome-based solutions, something that can add value for the customer in terms of improving connectivity, reducing costs, boosting efficiency, and increasing reliability.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and vision for Baker Hughes in the region?<br></strong>There is greater importance on in-country value. Everyone is trying to bring more companies into Dubai and expand and diversify their industries, hence developing an ecosystem that might not have been there before. It is about building local capabilities, job creation, and strengthening the supply chain. The purpose is creating a business environment that is sustainable and able to keep up with the growth our markets are witnessing. Our partnerships are aligned to developing in-country value, creating more jobs, developing more talent, and enhancing local content. These are not just any jobs, but sophisticated, technical, and high-end jobs. There is a fantastic pool of talent in the UAE, and everyone is trying to attract these people to their companies. Being a partner is a core piece of our strategy. As a partner, you have to invest in each other equally. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As Dubai drives digital transformation across all sectors and industries, how is DEWA pioneering this transformation in the public sector?</strong><br>We are working toward a new digital future through Digital DEWA, our digital arm, which aims to disrupt the entire business of public utilities by becoming the world's first digital utility provider based on four pillars: launching advanced solar power technologies; deploying a renewable energy grid with innovative energy storage technologies; expanding the use of integrated AI solutions to make Dubai the first city to provide AI-based electricity and water services; and the MORO data hub that provides advanced and innovative digital solutions, locally and globally. The Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 aims to provide 75% of Dubai's total power output from clean energy by 2050. To achieve this, DEWA launched several renewable programs and initiatives, including the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the largest single-site solar park in the world. Using the independent power producer (IPP) model, it will have a capacity of 5,000MW by 2030. Upon completion, the solar park will reduce over 6.5 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually. DEWA has adopted the IPP model in the solar park's projects to promote PPPs. Through this model, DEWA achieved the lowest international prices for electricity for the fifth time.</p><p><strong>Having led delegations to Singapore and China, how is DEWA both learning from and contributing to global best practices?<br></strong>DEWA exchanges best practices and expertise with leading international organizations, and its practices are benchmarks for utility providers around the world. DEWA has achieved extremely competitive results in global benchmarking, surpassing major European and American utilities. In customer minutes lost per year, DEWA's figures reached 2.39 minutes, compared to 15 minutes recorded by leading utility provider in the EU. DEWA has reduced losses in power transmission and distribution networks to 3.3%, compared to 6-7% in Europe and the US. Water network losses fell to 6.5%, one of the best results in the world. The UAE, represented by DEWA, has maintained the top ranking for the third consecutive year for getting electricity in the World Bank's Doing Business 2020 report, achieving 100% in all criteria.</p><p><strong>How is DEWA promoting innovation and intellectual property standards to drive technological and economic growth in the Emirate?</strong><br>HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the Dubai 10X initiative to mandate the government of Dubai to become a global leader that is 10 years ahead of all other cities through government innovation and reshaping the way things are done. To achieve this initiative, DEWA is committed to incorporating innovation in all its strategies and initiatives, as well as adopting disruptive technologies. We are also committed to sharing expertise and best practices in these sectors and have strategic partnerships with global technology leaders. DEWA is the first government utility in the world to join the Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution of the World Economic Forum (WEF) as a partner.</p><p><strong>How is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park project implementing the latest technologies?<br></strong>Its fourth phase is the largest single-site solar IPP project in the world that combines concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic technology with a capacity of 950MW. It will use 700MW of CSP; 600MW from a parabolic basin complex and 100MW from a solar tower; and 250MW from photovoltaic solar panels. The project will feature the tallest solar tower in the world at 260m. It will also have the biggest global thermal storage capacity of 15 hours, allowing for energy availability around the clock. The fourth phase achieved the world's lowest CSP LCOE of USD0.073 per kWh and the lowest LCOE for photovoltaic technology of USD0.024 per kWh. DEWA has achieved a world record by receiving the lowest bid of USD0.016953 per kWh for the 900-MW fifth phase of the solar park using PV solar panels, based on IPP. This phase will become operational in stages starting from 2Q2021. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>How did an international sportsman—a cricketer—end up in politics, and how did he become prime minister? This may interest you as a way of understanding what I intend to do with Pakistan. I grew up in Pakistan and am part of the first generation of Pakistanis from the 1960s when the country was considered the fastest-growing in Asia and a model for the developing world. I just met Sheikh Mohammed today, and he reminded me that Emirates Airline was helped by Pakistan Airlines in the 1970s. Pakistan was a country with optimism and hope. We grew rapidly, had an excellent governance system, and our bureaucracy was one of the best in Asia. That is the Pakistan I grew up in. </p><p>Then, I played international cricket. When I started, Pakistan was one of the weakest teams in the world, and we were emerging from colonialism. So, we took great pride as our team became stronger and competed. By the time I left cricket, Pakistan was the world champion. So I took pride, like my countrymen, as we competed internationally and grew in confidence. But unfortunately our country could not keep up that pace. The life of a country is in cycles, never in a straight line. Some go up, while others go down. <br>When I left cricket, I started building the first cancer hospital in Pakistan because my mother had died of cancer. I realized there was no cancer hospital in the whole country. I could go abroad, but what happened to the common man? Cancer is one of the most expensive treatments, so I started this movement. When I went out to the public to gather donations, I realized that our people are very generous and strong. The poorest of the poor supported me, and I did what no one ever thought could happen and built the hospital from that public collection. And it is a cancer hospital where 80% of patients get free treatment. They built it, and they run it. <br>I kept thinking: why is it that people are so generous, but do not pay taxes? Then, I discovered we were among the top five in charitable donations. But, at the same time, we are at the bottom in paying taxes because people do not trust the government. They thought their taxes were wasted by the government and spent on the lavish lifestyle of the ruling elite. <br>But there was a third reason why I ended up in politics. I used to play professional cricket in England, so half my year was spent in England and half in Pakistan. I saw how a developed country and its institutions worked, why they moved ahead, how governments were accountable, and that there was meritocracy. Above all there was human development—money spent on human beings. But then I also saw other countries develop, one of which was the UAE. I played cricket in the UAE from 1980 onward and saw that the UAE kept on developing. Later, we saw China develop. The common thread in all countries that have gone ahead is governance. This has two aspects. One is that a government has to be accountable. The more accountable and clean a government is, the more successful it is. Second is meritocracy. What is the point of having great talent if you do not have a system of meritocracy that helps it flourish? <br>My motivation for the Pakistan I wanted to see—and I am a student of history, especially Islamic history—was based on the Prophet, peace be upon him, and the state of Medina that he created, which laid the foundation of one of the greatest civilizations in the history of mankind. The principles that were the foundation of the state of Medina formed what was for the next 700 years the greatest civilization on earth. And what were those principles? Justice and humanity. It was the first time a welfare state was created, a state that took care of the weak, what China has done right now. The state of Medina was the first time a state took responsibility for its poor, weak, orphans, widows, and elderly, and the first time pensions were created. Second, there was justice and the rule of law. Third, the Prophet of Islam, peace be upon him, made seeking knowledge a sacred duty. His last sermon is a charter of human rights about how human beings are equal. It was a humane state created with the rule of law and an emphasis on education that led to the growth of Muslim civilization. This is the basis of the reform program being undertaken in Pakistan. </p><p>*From a speech given at the World Government Summit, Dubai, February 10, 2019</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As-salí¢mu alaykum. Peace be with you. With a heart grateful to the Lord, in this eighth centenary of the meeting between Saint Francis of Assisi and Sultan al-Malik al Kí¢mil, I have welcomed the opportunity to come here as a believer thirsting for peace, as a brother seeking peace with brethren. We are here to desire peace, to promote peace, to be instruments of peace. </p><p>The logo of this journey depicts a dove with an olive branch. It is an image that recalls the story—present in different religious traditions—of the primordial flood. According to the biblical account, in order to preserve humanity from destruction, God asked Noah to enter the ark along with his family. Today, we too in the name of God, in order to safeguard peace, need to enter together as one family into an ark which can sail the stormy seas of the world: the ark of fraternity.<br>The point of departure is the recognition that God is at the origin of the one human family. He who is the Creator of all things and of all persons wants us to live as brothers and sisters, dwelling in the common home of creation which he has given us. Fraternity is established here at the roots of our common humanity, as “a vocation contained in God's plan of creation." This tells us that all persons have equal dignity and that no one can be a master or slave of others.<br>We cannot honor the Creator without cherishing the sacredness of every person and of every human life: each person is equally precious in the eyes of God, who does not look upon the human family with a preferential gaze that excludes, but with a benevolent gaze that includes. Thus, to recognize the same rights for every human being is to glorify the name of God on earth. In the name of God the Creator, therefore, every form of violence must be condemned without hesitation, because we gravely profane God's name when we use it to justify hatred and violence against a brother or sister. No violence can be justified in the name of religion.<br>I wish to express appreciation for the commitment of this nation to tolerating and guaranteeing freedom of worship and to confronting extremism and hatred. Even as the fundamental freedom to profess one's own beliefs is promoted—this freedom being an intrinsic requirement for a human being's self-realization—we need to be vigilant lest religion be instrumentalized and deny itself by allowing violence and terrorism. There is no alternative: we will either build the future together or there will not be a future. Religions, in particular, cannot renounce the urgent task of building bridges between peoples and cultures. The time has come when religions should more actively exert themselves, with courage and audacity, and without pretense, to help the human family deepen its capacity for reconciliation, the vision of hope, and the concrete paths of peace.<br>The purpose of education, which in Latin means “extracting, drawing out," is to bring to light the precious resources of the soul. It is comforting to note how in this country investments are being made not only in the extraction of the earth's resources, but also in those of the heart, in the education of young people. It is a commitment that I hope will continue and spread elsewhere. Education also happens in a relationship, in reciprocity. Alongside the famous ancient maxim “know yourself," we must uphold “know your brother or sister:" their history, their culture, and their faith, because there is no genuine self-knowledge without the other. As human beings, and even more so as brothers and sisters, let us remind each other that nothing of what is human can remain foreign to us. It is important for the future to form open identities capable of overcoming the temptation to turn in on oneself and become rigid.<br>Investing in culture encourages a decrease of hatred and a growth of civility and prosperity. Education and violence are inversely proportional. Catholic schools, well appreciated in this country and in the region, promote such an education on behalf of peace and reciprocal knowledge in order to prevent violence. Young people, who are often surrounded by negative messages and fake news, need to learn not to surrender to the seductions of materialism, hatred, and prejudice. They need to learn to object both injustice and the painful experiences of the past. They need to learn to defend the rights of others with the same energy with which they defend their own. One day, they will be the ones to judge us, and they will judge us well if we have given them a solid foundation for creating new encounters of civility. </p><p>*From a speech given in Abu Dhabi at the Interreligious meeting at the Founder's Memorial 2019.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the main achievements of 2019-2020 for DG in Mexico?</h4><p><span></span>We came into this project with a short period of time to complete it, so our priority at the beginning was this project. Over 2019, we have been able to expand our presence in the country and understand better its rules, regulations, banking system, and the labor system. Our approach in key markets is not to make a project then leave but rather to establish our presence for a long time. We had the opportunity to develop our business with new clients and we strongly believe in training people in the country in line with our goal to establish our presence here. </p><h4>What is the difference between working in the Gulf of Mexico compared to other projects you have worked in?</h4><p><span></span>Our experience in Mexico has been mostly with clients that are major international oil companies, meaning that processes and procedures stay the same. We do not see any particular problem from a technical point of view, and compared to other countries, it has been easier because of the open mentality and the fact that it is not an emerging market.</p><h4>How is the company adapting to the current low oil price situation?</h4><p><span></span>Right now is difficult not only for the price but also for the future of oil. Regarding the price, the market has changed and oil companies have different mentalities from 10-15 years ago. They are now looking for a tighter market before they start producing oil and gas as quickly as possible to save money. In order to face this situation, the solution for us is to integrate our services and be flexible; in other words, be a multinational but with the flexibility of a medium-sized company. In DG, we decided to have partnerships not only a logistics international group but also with an early production group and a construction group in order to integrate competencies and thus be faster in decisions and cheaper in price. We are supporting one of our main contractors with our early production equipment as they were not ready to produce because of delays. With our technology and know-how, we set up equipment that are able to produce even if the plant is not ready, meaning the client will recover investment from the production phrase, even if they were not ready to produce. </p><h4>Is the low-cost market an opportunity to show how to increase profits at lower costs?</h4><p><span></span>Constantly changing situations call for different solutions at different times. Good companies are the ones able to better understand the needs of the market. With the issue of price and the changing attitude of oil companies, the integration of competences is the key aspect. The oil industry also faces the problem of the environment, with companies moving more toward alternative energies such as solar, wind, and nuclear. That is why DG is trying to invest in new technology and partnering with universities and other players in the market to move the oil business to greener ways. We started investing in other energies in 2018 with the help of three universities. We also are talking with a start-up incubator to study new processes and products. </p><h4>How would you compare the legal framework that Mexico around the energy sector compared to other markets?</h4><p><span></span>We have experienced much more difficult markets in North Africa and Central Asia, especially Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Thanks to these experiences, we found Mexico's market much easier than other countries. Mexico is open to receiving external know-how, and it has a great geographical advantage as it is close to the US. So, from a logistics point of view, it is easy to work here. There are some harder aspects, such as the climate, but what Mexico offers in terms of industry and internal production helps us do our job better. Its steel market is solid so it is easy to buy steel. With a logistics provider as a project partner, we have been able to make decisions faster. The objective is to finish the project as soon as possible and do everything possible to achieve this. The Gulf of Mexico's big opportunity is the commissioning activity to remove all old platforms in the Gulf. We want to find the appropriate answer for the client. </p><h4>What are your main priorities in Mexico for the rest of 2020?</h4><p><span></span>We want to expand our presence in the market. Our target is to become the leader in the market for oil companies. Our team has done a great job by delivering the project before the target date. We entered the market with a contract with Italian company ENI, and our target now is to develop our activities and services toward other players in the market. We have now been in Mexico for two years and are proud to have worked already with the Mexican market's two most important oil companies. We are supporting our clients in many services, which signals that we are doing a great job and being responsible with our clients. In general, our first target (which we have already achieved) has been to build a new structure using something that already existed through integration and flexibility. The next step is figuring out what to invest in innovation to propose new solutions, processes, and products to the market in order to make a real difference.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which opportunities in the market motivated you to enter the Mexican payments market?</h4><p>We did our research and used our experience in the banking sector to identify three particular areas to enter. In short, there are three main developments that motivated us to enter Mexico. One is the start of the fintech initiative by the Mexican government. This shows that Mexico is moving toward digital payments and opening up the economy. Secondly, in 2019 the Central Bank introduced CODI payments to enable those at the bottom of the pyramid to participate in the payments ecosystem. Moreover, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV) recently published its open banking resolution. All of this pushed us to enter the digital payments area in Mexico, where we are now working with a few players.</p><h4>How do you plan to break down the complexity of payment systems for businesses in Mexico?</h4><p>The important thing is to break down the complexity and provide a simple offering to any player in the entire spectrum of the payment cycle. That is our key differentiator. We are always looking at how we can make the process easier for an end customer who has a mobile to handle electronic payments without training. We are bringing automation by experience so that we do not increase the number of people required to do the same operations but refine it and make it into a consistent approach. The contributing factor in Mexico is that there is a mature payments system here; not every country has the level of real time payments like Mexico. Mexico is now moving forward by changing the players and system, and introducing new fintech and banking regulations to open up the market and attract new players. Moreover, the Central Bank is open to moving things to the cloud. Once you open such opportunities to the private sector, agility will come automatically.</p><h4>Do you agree that when it comes to digital payments systems, Mexico is ahead of other countries?</h4><p>Yes, and this is why everyone is looking at Mexico as the main driver for the entire Latin American market. This is a good place for the country to be in.</p><h4>What other markets has PayNways entered?</h4><p>At present, we have a presence in the US and India. We want to expand into Southeast Asia and the Middle East and are in discussions with stakeholders in the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Dubai in the UAE. We were expecting to close a deal in the Philippines by the end of 2020 but we have to push that back because of the pandemic. We have taken a step back to understand how we can better take advantage of the present and devise better and stronger expansion strategies. In the near future, you will see PayNways expand into a number of markets.</p><h4>In what ways has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted your business model and how have you adapted?</h4><p>We were semi-digital in terms of presence so it has not impacted us too much. That said, it did impact our business. We had to push back some of the agreements and slow down our expansion plans. We have to wait and see how different regions and countries will cope with the pandemic. We decided it was better to take this time to strengthen our products and offering. We have introduced a number of digital payment offerings such as digital wallets. Moreover, with the number of cyberattacks increasing, we decided to work on the security of our payment processes. We started these initiatives to bring more stability and scalability.</p><h4>In what ways are the digital payments market in India and Mexico similar?</h4><p>India was one of the first country to start QR payments along with China. India and Mexico share a lot of cultural similarities, which brings a lot of cohesiveness between people. Our key focus area is how to become a local company in every country that we go and ensure that we have a local presence with local staff. It is always key to bringing in best practices but at the same time adapting to the needs of local markets, which is a challenge for a lot of companies. If you don't adapt to the local market, it is hard to create a strong global impression.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges you faced in the Mexican market?</h4><p>Our team in Mexico features some people who are famous and well known in the Mexican banking fraternity. They have been working in the banking sector for the past 30 years and we have used their networks to establish our presence. This allowed us to avoid many challenges in the beginning. Bringing in the best local practices and our global experience helped us to move faster.</p><h4>What is your advice for business leaders in terms of focus and investment in these times of uncertainty?</h4><p>First of all, as a responsible business leader, our foremost responsibility is to keep all people safe and to reduce stress by engaging them in initiatives and activities. These are the key areas where we as business leaders should act. This will be our focus for the next couple of months until we receive news about a vaccine. Everyone is trying to figure out a way to fight the virus. One thing is for sure: if something similar in the future happens, people will be better prepared to face it.</p><h4>What are your objectives and goals for the rest of the year?</h4><p>Our goal is to be known as the niche payments player in the Mexican market as we expand globally. We are evaluating our strategy on how to launch ourselves as a fintech with offering we can have within the Mexican market. We are trying to position our products according to the CNBV's open banking regulations. In the near future, we plan to consolidate our offering and offer ourselves as a fintech partner to for banks and other institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does ADNIC differentiate itself in a competitive insurance landscape?<br></strong>The key to ADNIC's strategy is that it is customer-centric. We have invested heavily in pursuing this approach by improving service delivery and developing our human resources. Investing in talent inevitably translates into sustained success in the market, which is how we differentiate ourselves and build the ADNIC brand.</p><p><strong>What cost pressures does ADNIC face, and what are the company's strategies to mitigate them?<br></strong>The main challenge is the severe level of unhealthy competition and price warring in the market, which, unfortunately, we expect to continue for some time. Similar to others in the region, the Dubai market is driven more by price, and the margin for loyalty is smaller in most cases. Interestingly, the SME segment is larger in Dubai than other Emirates, and that is considered in our approach to this market. Although there are large segments of the market in which price is the only driving factor for customer decision-making, ADNIC remains competitive by playing separately from other companies. We may not be always the best regarding price, though we compensate for those challenges by catering to clients who consider both price and service delivery. These clients, including corporate business and individual customers, are able to pay more for superior service. Of course, service expectations are continuously changing. ADNIC strives to continuously enhance the customer experience and service offering. New technologies allow us to explore and apply new delivery methods. For example, it has been observed that clients lose their patience over time; if one year they are happy to wait 10 minutes for a service, the following year they only expect to wait five. Automation allows ADNIC to shorten this time for walk-in customers. Moreover, we continuously update our mobile app, as our clients benchmark us against peer insurance companies as well as the major banking apps in the market.</p><p><strong>As a national insurance company, what role does ADNIC play in raising awareness of genetic diseases, and how do initiatives in this area reduce the number of claims?</strong><br>Building awareness of pre-existing health conditions is an important task for an insurance company, and there are two sides to this. One is ADNIC's CSR and commitment to the wellbeing of the people of the UAE. The other is the positive impact on our business if the population is healthier, and the consumption of health services decreases. There is a prevalence of genetic and lifestyle diseases in the region that costs governments millions of dollars annually. ADNIC has an audit unit within its risk management division that comprises a group of doctors who frequently meet with health providers to help reduce fraud levels, overuse, and abuse. This partially addresses the issue; however, efforts are also required from other stakeholders, such as the regulatory bodies in the sector. This is also a matter of concern for them, and they are working hard to address this.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the work you are planning with the Al Etihad Credit Bureau?<br></strong>Receivables is one of the most serious challenges facing the insurance industry. Our relationship with Al Etihad Credit Bureau allows us to mitigate the risk proactively. By evaluating credit risk in advance, we are in less danger of incurring defaults. It helps strengthen our ability to control and manage credit risk exposure in our operations, and in turn proactively select clients on the basis of appropriate credit and financial screening. Other innovative technologies we are applying allow us to immediately assess the level of risk when the underwriters submit a quotation, so that we can be aware of risk before making a commitment.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the sharia-compliant insurance market?<br></strong>The sharia-compliant market has grown but not as much as expected. An important feature in the takaful concept is that the policyholder is also a shareholder, so at the end of the year he or she receives part of the profit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Western Union enhanced its digital services in the UAE? <br></strong>Western Union's global digital money-moving capabilities were recently enhanced in the UAE as part of the company's deep commitment to keeping the country at the forefront of the digital revolution. In the UAE, the company launched the Western Union app and relaunched the Westernunion.com website in association with local agent Al Fardan Exchange, one of the UAE's leading financial services providers. Customers in the UAE can now connect to their families and loved ones around the world digitally with the choice of paying for transactions online or within the app via direct transfers from their local bank accounts.</p><p><strong>What are the next advancements needed in terms of regulatory frameworks for Western Union to further expand its digital services in the UAE and region? </strong><br>In the UAE, customers can send money online via direct transfers from their bank accounts. Customers also have the choice to conduct transactions digitally and pay in-person at agent locations. We continue to explore the possibility of online transfers via credit and debit cards. Another hot topic in this space is image monitoring and facial recognition. Governments have historically favored a more conservative stance even in areas of potentially more effective solutions such as electronic know your customer (eKYC) solutions. Digital trends and innovation cycles are moving ahead in advance of regulations, which always take time to catch up. Western Union is currently exploring facial recognition as a step in the eKYC process in some markets, which could potentially enhance efficiencies in data collection, verification, and due diligence. Additionally, it offers customers a better experience and more efficient controls, allowing them to provide verification details without the need for any manual intervention. Providing both senders and receivers their choice of channel is a key element of our money transfer strategy. We want to increase access points for Western Union services so consumers have the choice of interacting and transacting with the company based on their individual preferences. These options include sending money using cash at an agent location, digitally via mobile phone, online at WU.com through bank accounts or cards, and ATMs.</p><p><strong>What are your key partnerships in the UAE to advance digital products and services? <br></strong>At present, we are focused on the success of our digital collaboration with Al Fardan Exchange. We may consider other similar types of relationships in the future. This launch is a prime example of how we are starting to leverage our platform in new ways, bringing value to customers, and making it easier than ever for them to move money in a way that fits their lives. Western Union's strategy is to continue rolling out its omnichannel offerings and provide a wide range of services for both pay-in and pay-out, mixing physical-only, digital-only, and physical and digital solutions.</p><p><strong>What role do Dubai and the UAE play in your regional portfolio, and which markets is Western Union focusing on in the short to medium term?</strong><br>The Middle East is a vital and rising economic hub bringing people together from across Europe, Africa, and Asia and lifting them toward prosperity. International migrants working and living across the region represent a large part of the population and collectively send billions in remittances back home. In the UAE, 88% of the population is made up of international migrants, followed by Qatar at 75%, Kuwait at 72%, Bahrain at 51%, Oman at 41%, Jordan at 40%, and Lebanon at 34%, according to the World Bank. Also based on these figures, the UAE is a top-10 person-to-person remittance market in the world. Western Union provides regulated, convenient channels for money transfers to over 200 countries and territories around the world. Our focus is expanding in terms of access points, and since consumers demand change, we are expanding our digital services to give them the convenience of sending money any time from their desktop or mobile phones.<br> <br><strong>How do various nationalization plans in many GCC countries impact the remittances and money transfer market?<br></strong>Nationalization plans in some markets are resulting in changing migration patterns. This trend impacts any company that operates globally, and Western Union, like all great firms, is aware of these rising trends. The fact is that, despite current protectionist trends, globalization is a force that cannot be reversed. Technology and migration make this inevitably so. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

Telecoms could get a short-term boost as well. Real estate companies will not benefit directly but will get a chance to promote their assets to a larger and new audience. The immediate benefits for the financial sector are limited. Over time, as concepts and ideas get commercialized, banks will be able to capitalize on intermediation both in lending activity and merchant banking activities through the generation of fee income. Dubai aspires to be a financial hub between Singapore and London. From this perspective, Expo 2020 should have a role to play as it is a unique opportunity to showcase Dubai to the rest of the world.</p><p><strong>As the one to establish DIFC and position Dubai's rise to where it is today, how will Dubai reach its always increasing ambitions and pioneer the future of financial hubs?</strong><br>In 2019, Dubai rose up the ranks of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI) to eighth position, representing its highest-ever ranking. The city is the only financial center within Middle East Africa and South Asia (MEASA) region to appear within the top 10 rankings. With more than 24,000 professionals working across over 2,200 active registered companies, DIFC comprises the largest and most diverse pool of industry talent in the region. DIFC's wealth and asset management market, which was reported to be USD424 billion in 2018, is equivalent to approximately 30% of the GCC's combined GDP. Dubai has consistently risen within the rankings since the index was launched 12 years ago. The city's steady ascent has been driven by DIFC's remarkable success in building an ecosystem that fosters financial industry growth. DIFC key to success has been the continuous pursuit of excellence and a focus on innovation.</p><p><strong>How does Al Mal Capital seek to position itself as these new opportunities begin to take shape and the UAE looks to rebound?<br></strong>Al Mal is one of the leading financial institutions in the UAE and is uniquely positioned to benefit from Dubai's expansion as a financial center. The breadth of our platform, our ESCA license, and the backing of a strong shareholder (Dubai Investments) enable us to attract the best talents and to structure world-class financial products and solutions. Our platform is scalable, which means we can not only act as a hub for local and international product management but also as a local distributor of international third-party products. When it comes to UAE assets, Al Mal is well positioned across the value chain. For instance, Al Mal UAE equity fund has the best and longest track record on the UAE equity market with an 80% outperformance since its inception. We have always been at the forefront of real estate and private equity investments and continue to invest in local assets mainly thanks to the support of Dubai Investments. Local and regional capital markets activity will soon recover, triggering renewed appetite for IPOs and new issues. We aim to play a major role thanks to our corporate advisory capabilities.</p><p><strong>2020 marks 15 years for Al Mal Capital. What are your strategic priorities and vision as we look to the coming decade?</strong><br>From day one, Al Mal Capital's vision has been to be considered as the investment institution of choice in the MENA region. We are among the few local institutions that have survived over the last 15 years. Still, we are only at the start of our story. There are tremendous opportunities ahead of us, and we are uniquely positioned to seize them. Our first strategic priority is to serve our clients in the best way. The whole firm needs to work hard and efficiently to deliver high-performing, differentiated, and compliant solutions with impeccable client servicing. We stick to our core offering which include direct investments, corporate advisory, asset management, and capital markets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Nasdaq Dubai expanded and diversified in recent months?<br></strong>We have had a successful year on many fronts. Equities traded value increased by 38% compared on 2018, while on the fixed-income side, Dubai is now the largest regional venue for foreign currency debt listings. Our sukuk market continues to expand with over USD14 billion from 17 listings. Dubai is now home to USD64 billion in sukuk listings, which makes it one of the largest venues globally for that asset class. We have attracted 54% of that value from outside the country, while the UAE accounts for 46%, indicating a healthy national and international balance. We have also listed six conventional bonds during 2019. Leading banks from China are continuing to list their bonds with us, underlining our role as the go-to jurisdiction in the region for hosting Chinese debt issuers. In further diversification, in 2019 we expanded our equity derivatives market. Firstly, we introduced derivatives on the Saudi Arabian market, which makes us one of the only exchanges in the region to offer derivatives in both its own and in regional markets. We initially created single stock futures on 12 Saudi Arabian companies in January 2019 before launching futures on the MSCI UAE Index in line with our license from MSCI to launch futures on their regional indices. We also took that template to partner with FTSE Russell, which led to us creating futures on the FTSE Saudi Arabia Index. We are pleased with how the derivatives market has grown since we launched it in 2016.  It now consists of 33 products, comprising 17 UAE single stock futures as well as our Saudi single stock futures and futures on four different indices. Our Murabaha solution for Islamic financing was also very active during the year. This platform, launched with Emirates Islamic and utilizing our central securities depository, is one of our key initiatives that enhance Dubai's Islamic finance offerings. Murabaha facilitates Islamic banks to offer borrowers sharia-compliant financing. Previously, there was no similar platform that could facilitate this in the region. To date, the platform has executed some USD157 billion in transactions.</p><p><strong>What other markets and jurisdictions is Nasdaq Dubai looking to expand into?<br></strong>We are predominantly active in the Middle East and have growing activities in Asian markets.  We also create a mix that allows investors from the rest of the world, such as the US and Europe, to participate. In equities, 37% of our liquidity comes from the US, which is substantial. We have 30% coming from Europe, 6% from Asia, and the rest from the Middle East and Africa. This gives issuers an excellent platform to access the world.  We have equity issuers from Asia, the US, Europe, and Africa. There is room for growth in equities, especially in a region such as ours that is predominantly debt focused. Fixed income and new product development will also remain a major growth driver for us. We will expand our issuer base, which already includes excellent representation from the region with companies from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Bahrain listed with us, as well as the UAE. Outside the region, we have debt listings from the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments as well as China and look forward to attracting more.</p><p><strong>What is your vision for Nasdaq Dubai in 2020 and beyond? <br></strong>Expo 2020 will give Dubai an unprecedented international reach. We are looking at companies that could benefit from Dubai as a platform, and the expo is a fantastic time for them to assess their options from a capital markets perspective. The driving question is how we add value and ensure that whoever comes to Dubai during the event sees the true potential and capacity here. If Nasdaq Dubai can help a company take its ideas to an audience that stretches from the US to China and get them excited, then we have done our part in being a launch pad for businesses to reach new investors.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you intend to increase awareness about takaful products? How does Dar Al Takaful fit in this landscape?<br></strong>There needs to be greater awareness about insurance in general in this part of the world, both takaful and conventional. Although some countries in the region, such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, have a high percentage of their GDP as insurance premiums, when we take out the contributions of the mega industries, such as petroleum refineries and aluminum smelters, there are hardly any other premiums. There are almost no personalized premiums here when compared with Europe or North America. In these markets, consumers set aside some money every month for retirement as well as household, car, and medical insurance. Here, people do not have savings or allocate money for insurance. General awareness about insurance has to grow, and, within that, awareness of takaful needs to increase. The concept of takaful, or the mutual sharing of risk, is the very basis that all insurance was originally built upon. Instead of a premium, takaful is based on a fixed amount we call a contribution, taken from the policyholders we pool. We then manage this money. Logically, at the end of the year, if the pool is in profit, we will give part of it back to the policyholders. Unfortunately, returns are not strong. We have to compete with the conventional insurance companies in terms of rates. There is an oversupply of insurance companies, so the rates are down. That leaves little margin for profit to be built up and returned.</p><p><strong>What makes Dar Al Takaful stand out in this very competitive insurance landscape?<br></strong>We have sought to differentiate our services by making them more personal and having an understanding of the customers' needs. We put the customer first. In the event one of our customers has a loss, due to a fire, for instance, we try to work out what that client needs to be able to get back on their feet and start their business again. That is the approach we take. Dar Al Takaful is one of the 12 participating insurance companies allowed to offer the basic compulsory insurance for low-paid workers. Everyone is competing in the compulsory insurance lines for motor and medical because there is not much awareness. People have little disposable income left to take up other insurance products. There is little business outside of these two insurance lines for vehicles and health. Medical and motor make up more than 70% of the premiums in the personal insurance sector in Dubai today. You can look at creating a niche product, but anything new you create has a shelf life of about 24 hours. It will immediately be replicated by the rest of the insurance market. And there is little incentive to be creative, as there is not much demand. If there was enough margin, you could work with low volumes. But Dubai is different from countries like India or Malaysia, where there is a huge burgeoning middle class.</p><p><strong>What are Dar Al Takaful's strategic priorities and vision?<br></strong>This is the same question we debated at our last board meeting. We decided to update the current vision, mission, and strategy. We are involving the entire company because we want each of our 150 employees to live and breathe our new mission and vision. Based on this new strategy, we will develop our financial predictions for the next three years. We drill those back into KPIs that apply to all of us. Broadly speaking, we do not want to be number one in overall premiums; we want to be the go-to insurance company and takaful provider. People should come to Dar Al Takaful saying, “We have heard good things about you. You treat your customers well." At the same time, we should produce reasonable returns for our shareholders and employees to stay happy. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Since Chedid Re established itself in Dubai, how have regulatory frameworks evolved?<br></strong>The UAE insurance sector has witnessed impressive growth over the last decade. This growth attracted many investors and many international players opened their appetite to position themselves in Dubai, hoping to secure their part of the cake. This has resulted in an increasing level of competition that drove margins down despite the market growth. This phenomenon is normal for any business cycle. It is also normal for companies to start thinking about consolidation. It is internationally recognized that for a consolidation process to take place, regulators should grant initiatives, and we expect to see an initiative should the regulator feel the timing is appropriate for consolidation. As far as Chedid Re's activity is concerned, it has gone through a considerable development related to governance and compliance. The insurance authority took the appropriate measures that impacted positively the industry in line with the accepted international practice and standards</p><p><strong>Is Expo 2020 impacting your operations?<br></strong>Expo 2020 is expected to bring together the best of trade, innovation, and products from all over the world to the UAE. As a result, the growth prospect is enormous. GDP is expected to grow by minimum 5%. The increase in consumption and tourism is predictable, with an estimated 25 million visits to the event, thousands of jobs, and an approximated USD82 billion worth of projects in the areas of housing, entertainment, and infrastructure by 2020. All the above will have an impact on the whole insurance sector, Chedid Re, and the insurance lines on which we have the expertise and know-how.</p><p><strong>When motor and health insurance became mandatory, what impact did it have on your company?<br></strong>Since we offer a complete solution to our clients, we have specialized departments within our treaty operation that handles medical and motor business. Using our regional volume and expertise helps us putting treaties for the insurance companies to better position ourselves as pioneer in these lines of business. Therefore, the impact of the motor and health insurance lines was sizable in our books since their mandatory implementation in 2017.</p><p><strong>What is the importance of human capital?<br></strong>The nature of our business depends highly on the quality of the people. As far as Chedid Re is concerned, human capital is a rare value, which is why we invest heavily in trainings and education, whether internal or external. When we talk about the best example of Chedid Re, we think about our values more clearly investing in our education.</p><p><strong>Are there any sectors that you would like to focus on in the short term?<br></strong>Having been in the market for the last 20 years, our brand mantra is linked to long-term commitment and excellence. Therefore, short-term opportunities are not in line with our corporate strategy.</p><p><strong>How do assess real estate developers' economic outlook?<br></strong>Developers witnessed a crisis that can't be simply overlooked and neglected. It would have an impact on their appetite for the short run. However, the long-term confidence with the market is still there, and it is only a matter of period that their activities would resume with the same previous pace assured by the vision of Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Sheikh Mohamad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, and the leaders of the UAE.</p><p><strong>What does the Dubai office bring to the group, and do you have any expansion plans?<br></strong>You cannot be a part of a serious financial institution in the Middle East without having a footprint in Dubai. Being present in Dubai, we are close to the decision making that have an impact on the insurance industry across all the region. Dubai became an international hub for the financial institutions not only for its regional presence. Because we have expansions plans beyond the region, we strongly believe Dubai is a gateway passport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the market's performance align with expectations, and how do you evaluate opportunities in 2020, particularly as we approach Expo?<br></strong>Unfortunately, the market did not see the expected pick up in 2019, mainly due to factors beyond the UAE's control. There are hopes that we will see a slow pick up in the second and third quarters of 2020. The areas that will see immediate pick up will be construction, trade, and tourism. Transportation is also expected to grow in 2020.</p><p><strong>What does innovation look like at Gargash Insurance?<br></strong>Integrating and adapting technology is mission critical for sustained growth. It clearly helps, especially those in the service industries, to reduce their costs of doing business, though it also requires huge capital investment in the near term for long-term benefits. Companies that are not in a position to make this upfront investment in technology will find it challenging to survive in the medium term because those who invest and expand their IT, AI, and similar capabilities will be able to operate more efficiently and cost effectively. Gargash is excited about the various initiatives it is taking, including some groundbreaking technology interface with underwriters in 2020. This will enhance delivery and customer satisfaction. Such platforms will be the precursor for AI solutions and analytics, taking the insurance and business ecosystem to greater heights.</p><p><strong>Given the competitive landscape, how does Gargash differentiate itself, and what is the value of having an insurance intermediary?</strong><br>By now, the market is developed well enough to appreciate the value addition a professional intermediary can bring to the customer with regard to value engineering and risk management. For Gargash, as a leading professional intermediary, we need to deliver our services far beyond customer expectations. Everyone is under pressure in terms of their bottom line, and therefore customers are looking for quicker response times from us. This means there is more price pressure on insurance companies in what has always been a competitive market. However, we have found it better to compete in terms of quality and not price. Dubai's strategic positioning is of great advantage to any business that has its central operations based here. We are fortunate that we are well established in this regionally and globally strategic location.</p><p><strong>How does this position you to expand beyond the UAE, and what opportunities are you seeing regionally?<br></strong>Our vision is that with the ongoing integration of technology in the GCC, the regulators will be have to adapt the law and its practice to permit regional and interstate business transactions without typical brick-and-mortar offices. From our point of view, if we come across the right opportunity in any of our neighboring markets, we will not shy away from investing. While this is happening regionally, our focus is to remain the leading national professional intermediary in our local market with an emphasis on facilitating ease of business transactions for our customers, both corporate and individual. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the competitive landscape like for you?</strong></p><p>We run not only some global strategies from Dubai but also local strategies. Since we have the range of global and local strategies, we arguably can offer more than the local players, whose strategies generally remain local. We have our feet in both buckets. With a roughly USD709.5-billion portfolio globally as of July 31, 2019, clients attach credibility and trust with us. At the end of the day, we are a business of trust.</p><p><strong>What do you consider an ideal investment strategy for any clients looking to enter the region?<br></strong>In terms of what is most ideal for investors, there are two things. One is that most global investors have a large domestic bias. If investors are getting decent returns buying in the local currency, they are not interested in taking their money elsewhere. However, some of the more sophisticated clients have the GCC as a big chunk of their portfolio as well as global equity, global fixed income, and investments in China or India. The challenge in the Middle East is that most private bankers are chasing high-end clients, so this segment is over banked. There is more work to be done in the mass market, especially the middle class, which is not well serviced at present.</p><p><strong>What products differentiate Franklin Templeton Investments?<br></strong>We launched the industry's first Islamic buy-and-hold product. It was the first time such a fund was launched in the market. We have had more customized funds since as well. We have also acquired prestigious new institutional clients. This has given us great credibility in the market and will help us build a track record in the high yield space moving forward. We have also acquired different strategies, such as Brazilian equity. It gives us a great feeling that we have such a wide range of capabilities and strengths within the firm. Sharia assets have also seen great growth, representing over USD2 billion. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What trends do you see in your membership base?<br></strong>The core of our membership is composed of banks and investment banks active in the regional bond and sukuk market. They are the most significant contributors, and the number of them working with us continues to grow. The region is developing strong local players, such as First Abu Dhabi Bank, which has become a regional champion. We see similar banks in Bahrain and Kuwait that now lead transactions, adding value  and thus competing with the global banks. A large portion of our work deals with regulatory matters. We have excellent relations with the regulators across different countries and with the relevant authorities and decision-makers. Legal firms are useful participants in our advocacy; they interact independently as well as through us, as we are a neutral forum.</p><p><strong>What is your overview of the current regulatory framework concerning sukuks?<br></strong>In the past few years, we have worked closely with the Emirates Securities and Commodities Authority (ESCA) on fundamental bond and sukuk regulations dealing with matters such as speeding up issuance processes, acquiring approvals, and managing different kinds of disclosure. Now, there are more nuanced regulations, and governments are becoming active participants. This leads to different regulatory questions on how to organize the market for government securities and relating that market to the capital market regulator, which deals primarily with equities and corporate sukuk. Furthermore, the role of Dubai's central bank needs to be defined in this relationship as it has a stake in the success of this market, as does the fiscal authority as an issuer. The diversity of the investors is still slightly lacking. There has been some forward motion, though not nearly enough diversification or development of the investor base. This space has to be filled so that the capital market reaches its potential.</p><p><strong>Which areas currently exhibit the most potential for the sukuk market?<br></strong>In more cases, the international use of sukuk was a one- or two-time occurrence, for example in Hong Kong, Luxembourg, and South Africa. These are all positive issuances, though they are mostly about establishing credentials. It is a powerful incentive to do the first sukuk. Indonesia is an interesting market that is developing locally as well as issuing sukuk internationally in large volumes. The issuances of sukuk in 2018 were strong. Health and education are growing sectors. In November 2018, we saw the first-ever sukuk by NMC Health. This is how regulation can help drive the sector in indirect ways, as health insurance was previously not required in UAE. The other story coming up is local currency. One reason for our existence is to promote local currency bond and sukuk markets. The UAE has not yet had local currency government issuance, though we could potentially see the federal government issuing securities. That would be supported by market infrastructure, which is being established with the central bank. This would help the latter improve its own monetary policy instruments. If the government issued medium- and longer-term securities, then the central bank could issue short-term securities.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us about the development of green sukuks and how they are affecting the industry?<br></strong>Indonesia had a green sukuk, and there have been issuances from Morocco as well. We have been talking about them for a long time. Green bonds, such as those issued by NBAD, was a great first step along the way to a green sukuk. The green bond market has grown grown explosively in recent years, offering a great opportunity for green sukuk. The green investor base is much bigger than the Islamic investor one. If one has a product that is green and sukuk, then it can truly grow the sukuk market, as well as do something consistent with its values. We look forward to further environment, social, and governance (ESG) investing. As a local organization, we want to promote the integration of ESG factors into investing. We are working with the UN principles for responsible investment (UNPRI) on raising awareness among regional investors. Our members are driving this, as they have the required expertise. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What has driven your success over the last few years?<br></strong>A large part of our success was due to internal restructuring to provide the foundations for growth, and in 2019 we continued to build upon this success. We achieved that growth by resetting and refocusing our strategy on becoming a more member-led exchange; we have over 175 global members, and they are the ones driving the products we list on the exchange. To a degree, our products have to be unique and regionally relevant and innovative. Futures trading, particularly that on a purely price basis, is not sharia-compliant due to its speculative nature. However, we worked with the two sets of sharia scholars Armanie Advisors and Minhaj Advisory to come up with a design for our sharia-compliant spot gold product, whilst receiving additional fatwas as to the veracity of its sharia compliance. When we talk about 'spot' products, this infers it is a product that is traded today for delivery tomorrow, whereas derivatives are traded today for a price at a set point in the future. My priority is to make the business more regionally relevant, and the sharia-compliant gold contract is a step in that direction. Our product was the region's first and is currently the world's only exchange-listed contract that bridges that gap. We are also the world's largest liquidity pool for Indian rupee trading outside of India, though we also list other currencies for trading, including G6 and Chinese yuan.</p><p><strong>As the exchange is based in the Middle East, how limited is your derivatives trading?<br></strong>Our client base is global. Although many of our clients are based in the GCC and originate from India, others come from China, Singapore, Europe, and elsewhere. We are in one of the most commercial cities on the planet, so why not tap into the potential here? The derivatives exchange is not widely known in the region, but we decided to base it here because it is a global business. Dubai also offers an advantageous time zone that allow us to remain open during the most liquid parts of the day in Asia, Europe, and the Americas. Recently, we launched aluminum and zinc contracts because our members wanted us to. The UAE is among the top-five aluminum producers in the world, and aluminum and zinc are heavily used in the construction industry.</p><p><strong>What other commodities are you looking at to make the exchange more locally relevant?<br></strong>We have trialed the base metals contracts: aluminum and zinc and, if necessary, lead and nickel. These products also complement our existing copper contracts. There are other emerging markets relevant to Dubai and the GCC that have wealthy clients, companies, and institutional investors exposed to their home currency's fluctuations. We already deal with currencies, so bringing in another currency is a marginal evolution. All the currencies we offer are paired to the US dollar, so people are trading the reference price against the dollar rather than trading the currency itself. We look at the local market demand, and the nationalities present here are the ones with exposure back home that perhaps do not have the tools to hedge their price risk exposure. We want to offer that currency, to which end I have a dedicated product development team researching new products for us to launch.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to attract more local members?<br></strong>Being strong in Indian rupee trading means we not only have a product, but also a fantastic marketing tool, allowing us to promote the hedging of risk with one of the UAE's largest trading partners. This concentration into one currency is actually working to our advantage and with the recent volatility has opened additional doors for us. That said, we need to diversify, and looking locally at the GCC makes a great deal of sense. All the local banks have their own sharia boards, and the UAE consolidates that into one central bank sharia board. We are working hard with the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) to ensure we are part of that project and process. If our sharia products get certified by the appropriate board, it would certainly provide a boost to the exchange. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>In 2019, you mentioned CBD's continuing innovative efforts in terms of digitalization. As the most innovative digital bank, how are you transforming yourself into a wholly digital bank? <br></strong>In the digital age, customer experiences are benchmarked by those provided by large tech companies such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon. Banks have to strive to offer a similar experience, and, hence, the only relevant measurement of the success of digitization and innovation is the improvement in customer experience. All of our efforts have been focused on achieving such an improvement. This started in 2017 when we were the first bank in the Middle East to launch a digital-only bank. Other examples are our positive pay solution to eliminate payment fraud and e-invoicing solutions to enable businesses to exchange and manage straight through processing of invoices in an integrated electronic format. The inauguration of CBD Lab, a corporate workspace focused on building a culture of innovation, collaboration, and disruption, has also enabled us to provide next-generation banking solutions to our customers through strategic collaborations with fintech start-ups. This is further augmented by a strategic JV with PwC, through which we source and evaluate fintechs on a global scale, assess their suitability for implementation within CBD, and run pilots. Only through an outside-in view, a global perspective, and strategic partnerships is one able to stay ahead of the curve in times of rapid change.</p><p><strong>Dubai is looking to position itself as the global Islamic economy capital, with Islamic finance playing a critical role. How is CBD capitalizing on this segment to drive growth and reach its forefront? </strong><br>CBD has always been supporting the government initiatives to drive Dubai's ambitions forward, in line with directives from our wise leadership. CBD offers innovative Islamic banking services to our corporate, commercial, and retail customers, through its CBD Al Islami brand managed by a team of professionals with extensive experience in sharia-compliant financial solutions. Like for all of our businesses, growth is driven by a relentless focus on customer needs and expectations.  As long as we continue to exceed our customers' expectations, CBD Al Islami will continue to expand.</p><p><strong>In addition to Islamic and trade finance, what other areas of growth has CBD identified in the financial sector, and what challenges need to be overcome?</strong><br>Overall economic growth over the coming years is forecasted to be positive, which will continue to boost the financial sector. This is further supported by Expo 2020, which will boost economic growth. On the back of these, I expect all segments, whether large corporations, SMEs, or retail, to grow. On a slightly more macro level, fintech will drive new business models and become an integral part of financial institutions' technology and operational infrastructure. Customer intelligence will also be an important driver of revenue growth and profitability. Solutions based on machine learning and AI in general will fundamentally change the nature of banking, particularly for retail clients, where the era of the “segment of one" is about to commence.</p><p><strong>What are your strategic priorities and vision for CBD heading into the coming years?<br></strong>CBD has a strong client base, a strong capital and liquidity position, and a fantastic team. Having just celebrated its 50th anniversary, CBD is well positioned to continue its fantastic performance and continue to be the bank of choice for its customers for the next 50 years and beyond. As long as we continue to focus on exceeding our customers' expectations, providing them the best experience possible, and putting them at the center of everything we do, CBD will continue to prosper. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you assess Dubai's ability to establish itself as a model for Islamic finance?<br></strong>Islamic finance has made an enormous impact on the global finance industry, with more and more banks establishing Islamic finance operations. According to the State of the Global Islamic Economy Report 2019/2020, global Islamic finance assets have grown 3.5% YoY, exceeding USD2.5 trillion in assets in the global Islamic finance industry and are projected to reach USD3.8 trillion by 2023. There is no doubt that Dubai has played a significant role in this strong growth trajectory as the Emirate aims to become the global capital of the Islamic economy. The wise leadership of the UAE has simultaneously ensured a strong business environment conducive to innovation, growth, and transformation within the profession. Today, Dubai is widely regarded as the epicenter of Islamic finance between east and west and has established itself as a model not only for the industry but also the wider global Islamic economy, which includes key pillars such as halal food, travel, tourism, entertainment, art, and culture. It is also no coincidence that Dubai is the birthplace of DIB, the world's first Islamic bank. Notably, the Emirate is also one of the world's largest venues for sukuk listings, and a number of diverse issuances that meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria have been made this year, further evidence of the sustainability of the business model that Dubai is showcasing to the world</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on DIB's progress in integrating and developing fintech and other innovative solutions? <br></strong>The global fintech market continues to grow and is now valued in excess of USD150 million and expected to triple in the coming five years to exceed USD150 billion. At DIB, we have always believed that continuous innovation is vital to our growth strategy. We have also always championed innovation in order to remain the most progressive financial institution in the world. Our primary approach to digital banking is always formulated with a clear focus on dissecting each step of the customer's journey and removing any pain points. Notable examples include the creation of paperless branches and our state-of-the-art mobile banking app. More recently, we launched Banking in Minutes, making us the first to own the element of 'time' in the industry. Now, UAE nationals and residents that were previously not DIB customers can open a bank account anytime anywhere within a few minutes via the powerful DIB mobile app, eliminating the need for them to visit a branch or complete copious amounts of paperwork. Going forward, the emergence of technology, robotics, and AI will all help provide opportunities for clients to experience ultimate banking. We continue to utilize and transform fintech to improve our internal processes, thereby enabling our customers to manage their finances more effectively.</p><p><strong>What have been some recent highlights as the country's largest bank?   <br></strong>We have reported strong financial results over the years, with net profit crossing AED4 billion, up roughly 8% year-on-year in 2019. If we look at the last five years, DIB has transformed into a regional financial powerhouse on the back of a successful growth strategy, which has seen our balance sheet double in size and profitability more than quadruple. This has placed the bank among the top two Islamic banks in the world and the top three most profitable in the UAE. We have also grown our international presence, becoming a torchbearer in promoting sharia-compliant financial services across a number of markets worldwide. Our international expansion is focused primarily on the “PIK" region of Pakistan, Indonesia, and Kenya, which allows us to connect the dots from the Far East to South Asia via the Middle East and Africa. Our operations in Kenya serve as a stepping stone to tap into the growing market in eastern Africa. Simultaneously, the rebranded Panin Dubai Syariah Bank in Indonesia is set to serve a thriving population of 200 million, 95% of whom are Muslims. DIB has also prepared to position itself as one of the largest Islamic banks in the world through the acquisition of Noor Bank in 4Q2019, creating the region's most progressive sharia banking group.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is DFSA's role in facilitating innovation in financial services?<br></strong>As a regulator, we tend to move in a cycle of seeing where risk is rising, writing regulation, and then adopting it in our supervision practices, but this cycle is now changing. Technological change in financial services is not new, but the speed of change is. The speed of change is greater than the speed of adoption, meaning you are unable to get comfortable with an innovation before it changes again. We cannot write regulations at the same speed as the technology. Technological change is putting pressure on our supervisors to understand business models of a financial services provider in a much deeper way. It is not so much about seeing if people are complying with a rulebook—although that continues to be important—but understanding where business is changing and the risks of that change. Understanding and supporting emerging technologies forms an important area of focus for DFSA. Innovation is one of the key strategic themes that will shape and influence our regulatory activities over the coming years, and we have been working to facilitate innovation in financial services in a number of ways. This includes our Innovation Testing License Program, which is our version of a regulatory sandbox. The program is intended for financial services firms that want to introduce an innovative financial service technology to our market. It allows a firm to test its technology in a controlled environment and allows us to develop an understanding of the technology and its regulatory implications before the firm is given full access to our market. We work very closely with the DIFC's FinTech Hive and its accelerator and start-up bootcamp programs, engaging directly with program participants to develop our understanding of their technologies and how they impact financial services in our markets. We are also founding members of the Global Financial Innovation Network, a group of 33 international financial regulators that seek to provide efficient ways for fintech firms to engage with regulators across multiple jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>What benefits and challenges does technology bring to effective regulation?<br></strong>I do not know of another regulator that has done this in the same manner as us, but a number of regulators around the globe are focusing more on technology. The face of regulation is changing, and we have to deal with that change effectively. We spend an increasing amount of time focused on technology governance, operational risks, and cyber resilience, all of which are areas of expertise. One of the biggest challenges for regulators is who to hire for this change. Will it be training a traditional financial sector supervisor how to look at new technology, or do you get a technology person and teach them how to regulate? In my opinion, it is easier to teach a technology expert how to regulate than vice versa. Thus, we are hiring from nontraditional sources. We have hired a cyber expert, and DFSA has an ethical hacker. We have brought together different areas of expertise into the system to interact with the financial service firms. Within this shifting discussion, the most pioneering and simultaneously challenging aspect of that space is cyber resilience. We are creating a cyber threat intelligence platform, which is the first in the entire region, whereby we are connecting other UAE authorities that are monitoring cyber risks with our firms and who might be getting attacked. You need to think about how to react if a breach has occurred, what to do, and who to tell. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How do you evaluate the progress of the Almas program and draft-costing model? What is the importance of such initiatives for public sector efficiency?<br></strong>DOF continues to work on the government's Service Costing Program, 'Almas,' which was launched in October 2018 and seeks to enhance transparency and accuracy in government fees. We are working on a draft cost model for each government entity and a centralized formula for government fees. The first phase of this project includes the collection of data and the calculation of the cost of 1,400 government services, including the Roads and Transport Authority, Dubai Customs, Dubai Municipality, Dubai Police, and the Dubai Economic Department. At a later stage, the project will cover 5,500 services provided by 23 government revenue-generating entities.</p><p><strong>What is the intended impact of the new PPP framework, and what is DOF's role in enabling PPPs?<br></strong>The framework has issued an Emirate-wide PPP policy and resulted in the establishment of a PPP unit within DOF that aims to consolidate the Dubai government's efforts in the PPP ecosystem. In addition, the framework also dictates the operating guidelines based on international best practices across the PPP procurement lifecycle and the formulation of a uniform budgeting approach to managing PPP liabilities and aggregate fiscal exposure. DOF also provides guidelines and toolkits to the contracting authorities, enabling a standardized process throughout the PPP procurement lifecycle. We provide final approval of the business case for projects as defined in the PPP Law No. 22 2015 and support the relevant contracting authorities during the phases of project identification, preparation, procurement, contract negotiations and awarding, execution, and monitoring and evaluation.</p><p><strong>With a budget surplus in the last few years, what is the significance of infrastructure, particularly Expo 2020-related projects, for the government's budget?</strong><br>The capital expenditure on infrastructure projects in Dubai, especially projects related to Expo 2020, top the priorities of the public budget as part of ensuring that key projects are completed as per schedule. The budget surplus generated over the last few years through prudent financial policies was used to fund these projects as per the objectives of Dubai Plan 2021, while Expo 2020-related projects will total AED30 billion.</p><p><strong>Can you elaborate on the DOF's contributions and leadership role in ensuring financial stability and stimulating economic growth? </strong><br>Being responsible for the development of the government's general annual budget and its execution, in cooperation with all relevant local government entities, the DOF provides liquidity, including transferring sanctioned budgetary allocations to all relevant government entities. It also oversees the preparation and development of financial resources and verifies the collection and provision of general revenues, while also supervising government bank accounts. Our continuous improvement of Dubai's public budget has been driven by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's directives to maintain the sustainability of Dubai's financial system, stimulate greater entrepreneurship and investment through economic stimulus measures, and further enhance Dubai's competitiveness as a global investment hub.<br> <br><strong>A series of recent initiatives, such as the freelance visa scheme, have centered on boosting entrepreneurship and attracting investment. What is your department doing to facilitate these efforts?  </strong><br>We work in accordance with the directives of HH Sheikh Mohammed to implement a range of economic and financial incentives and facilities aimed at reducing the cost of conducting business, supporting the registered companies in the Emirate, and attracting new investments. The government focus is on simplifying the procedures of conducting business and reducing the costs for companies by harnessing all possible resources in order to facilitate these economic accomplishments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do innovation and technology intersect with the creation of an enabling environment for businesses and start-ups? <br></strong>Technological innovation in the financial sector is driving economic development in the region by creating new opportunities and delivering great value to businesses and consumers alike. Since DIFC's inception in 2004, we have focused on creating an enabling environment for all types of businesses. Improving the ease of doing business provides young, bright local entrepreneurs the opportunity to establish and grow their companies by tapping into the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia region (MEASA). We also have a USD100 million fintech fund that provides funding to exciting new start-ups seeking financial support, not to mention an accelerator program dedicated to fintech scale ups, helping them grow through strategic partnerships. With its large young population that has some of the greatest mobile penetration in the world—21% higher than Western Europe—MEASA also presents significant opportunities for digital start-ups, particularly in mobile payments, which remains underpenetrated.</p><p><strong>Seeing as nearly 20% of DIFC 2.0's masterplan is dedicated to innovation, can you elaborate on the significance of integrating technology and innovation in DIFC 2.0?</strong> <br>The center's success is being powered by our focus on sector diversification, investment in innovation, and our unwavering commitment to attracting the best global and local talent. This comes in line with the UAE's Vision 2021 that aims to diversify the country's economy away from oil. In addition, as a leading international financial center, the DIFC is one of the pillars of the development of Dubai Future District, which was launched by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. Our priority is to develop the future of finance for the region from Dubai. Growth will be a key priority in 2020, as the DIFC's expansion plan will support Dubai's economic growth and financial services sector for the next few decades. We plan to take a phased approach that will enable us to steadily deliver on Dubai's ambitious growth plan while remaining focused on diversifying our ecosystem and advancing the financial sector.</p><p><strong>Having been named the eighth best financial center globally, how can DIFC's 2024 Growth Strategy help transform Dubai into the best financial hub? </strong><br>Despite our successes, our relentless focus on being a world-leading global financial center will continue. We will continue to grow our global reputation for being a dynamic, vibrant, and technologically advanced business hub that will transform the future of finance. Toward this aim, the 2024 strategy will consolidate our position as a major global financial and business hub while supporting Dubai's overall strategic drive to diversify its economy. We are already making great progress in executing DIFC's 2024 strategy. Our numbers manifest delivery excellence, which aligns with the vision of our leadership. We will execute this vision of a technology and innovation-driven future of finance with the same passion and effectiveness. In the meantime, we are continuously tracking and assessing our performance against our 2024 strategy to ensure a seamless delivery of our ambitious plans to shape the future of finance.</p><p><strong>Part and parcel of advancing DIFC is Islamic finance. How do you evaluate the advancement of Islamic finance in Dubai, and what is DIFC's role in promoting Dubai as its capital?</strong><br>As DIFC progresses in driving the future of finance, Islamic finance and the principles that guide it will continue to play a significant role in supporting sustainable growth within the regional financial services sector. What's more, Islamic finance is growing 1.5 times faster than traditional finance, with almost USD1 trillion in Islamic finance assets based in the GCC alone. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How would you assess Dubai's strengths and positioning in the Islamic economy today?<br></strong>If you look at the total size of the global Islamic finance industry, it is USD2.1 trillion, and at the end of 2018, there was USD1.6 trillion in banking assets. There is more than USD200 billion in banking assets in the UAE. The contribution of the industry is significant, with several issuers based in Dubai in particular. The most recent transaction here was the Emaar sukuk, which was oversubscribed. In addition to this contribution in terms of banking assets, you have the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC), which is trying to push the industry and resolve some of the issues it has been facing. The contribution of Dubai to the Islamic economy is significant, both quantitatively and in terms of the support being provided to the industry. S&amp;P's role is to provide the market with independent and objective credit opinions on issuers and credit quality. We also publish several thematic researches on Islamic finance throughout the year. S&amp;P Global Ratings won three Islamic finance awards in 2019.</p><p><strong>In what ways can fintech shift the Islamic finance industry?<br></strong>The other part of the industry that could be disrupted by fintech is the sukuk industry. The disruption could come with the increased use of blockchain. Blockchain today resolves three challenges that the sukuk industry faces. The first is the traceability of an underlying asset. With a sukuk, you need to have an underlying asset, and throughout the lifetime of the transaction, the sponsor of the sukuk can substitute the underlying asset. The only legal constraint is that the value of the new asset has to be the same as the value of the asset being taken out of the transaction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Finastra's role in Dubai's fintech ecosystem?<br></strong>Finastra was formed in 2017 from the merger of two fintech giants, Misys and D+H. We have over 8,500 customers globally, including 90 of the top 100 banks. Over the past two years, Finastra has moved from being a solutions provider to a platform company with the launch of FusionFabric.cloud, our platform for open innovation. We are changing the way financial services software is developed, deployed, and consumed like no one else by building the foundations of a completely new financial services ecosystem and marketplace. We are also opening up our APIs for core retail banking, payments, corporate banking, lending, and treasury and capital markets and enabling the wider ecosystem to build on top of them to increase innovation and offer better services to a growing market.</p><p><strong>How are you forcing banks to be more innovative?<br></strong>There are a mix of factors. Consumer trends, mobile adoption, the rise of fintechs, and changing regulations are all driving innovation in the industry. We enable banks to be more innovative by supplying them with the technical details to do this. For example, in the event a bank wants to develop an application to provide customers with a single view of all its relationships across different departments, the traditional way of providing this is time-intensive; by the time the product is ready, the market will already have shifted. It is vital to understand that the only constant is change. The end user has been pampered for so long that they demand from their banks the same services they get from their retail experiences. If they can get a fast service from Uber, then why not from their bank? This has pushed banks to be more innovative in creating better customer services. 6</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The UAE recently moved to ease regulations, allowing 100% foreign ownership of some of businesses outside free zones. What is the significance of these changes?</strong><br>The business landscape in the UAE has changed dramatically over the last 10-20 years, with the process of company formation significantly simplified. As the country strives to diversify and develop a knowledge-based economy, there is greater exposure to every sector. Dubai's reputation as a global trading hub has been further consolidated by world-class infrastructure, business-friendly laws, and a visionary government. Recent changes to regulations have also created more welcoming conditions for international companies that wish to establish a physical presence in the UAE. There are now one-stop service facilities available that expedite formalities, and trade licenses can now be renewed online. <br></p><p><strong>How do you assess the role of SMEs within the wider context of Dubai's economy?<br></strong>SMEs form an integral part of Dubai's economy, and there have been crucial efforts made by the government to foster entrepreneurial thinking and grow SMEs. Due to present incubation, acceleration, and advisory mechanisms in Dubai, there is an accepted view that SMEs are central to the wider effort of building a knowledge-based economy while also contributing to the smart city strategy. Dubai is safe; it is home to 199 different nationalities and has a fertile business environment. As such, SMEs should be assisted by business-friendly regulations and a support system that encourages innovation. A major barrier for SMEs can be start-up costs; however, there is access to funding support.  <br> <br><strong>What is your assessment on establishing an LLC versus setting up in a free zone?<br></strong>Business formation at a free zone has historically been easier and less time consuming than the establishment of an LLC, but I personally chose to form an LLC with my partner, as this gave us greater business flexibility. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What recent developments highlight the municipality's strategy to build corporate capacities and innovation?<br></strong>In today's world, innovation is inevitable for any organization to survive and progress, especially in Dubai. Dubai Municipality, as one of the leading governmental organizations, is committed to remaining in line with the government's directions, strategies, policies, and regulations, in which innovation is its key theme. Accordingly, and in the context of being an excellent and innovative municipality, we are adopting knowledge and innovation management ecosystems and strategies to ensure our innovation journey is directed in the right way. We have achieved many milestones, such as maintaining the kind of culture that fosters a philosophy of knowledge and innovation management and accepts trials and failures; adopting digital transformation strategies and using the latest technologies like AI, augmented reality, IoT, big data analytics, robotics, and blockchain; collaborating with start-ups and innovation partnerships and designing a continuum of customized motivation schemes to unlock creativity skills; creating customized programs to incubate and nurture creative employees, run innovation lab sessions, and promote concept testing; and encouraging registration of intellectual property through the adoption and implementation of a corporate approach for IP management that promotes impartiality and fairness. Meanwhile, we are also establishing and fostering innovation partnerships with various stakeholders in the public and private sectors, universities, and scientific research institutions, such as FabLab UAE; supporting research and applied studies directed at generating innovative solutions in line with international standards; and applying various motivation schemes to encourage participation in various innovation activities. We ensure that all our practices are in line with the relevant worldwide best practices and have been awarded with various international certifications and recognitions in the innovation management field.</p><p><strong>Much of the world now looks at Dubai as a model to be replicated. How does Dubai Municipality embody and embrace this shift?</strong><br>Dubai is seen now as one of the most prominent knowledge hubs across the world. Our aim is no longer to merely focus on acquiring the latest knowledge and best practices, but toward being creators of knowledge. Dubai is now focusing on exporting knowledge to the world. Human minds have no limits, which is why Dubai and in turn Dubai Municipality aim to create the ultimate environment to attract talent from across the planet and equip them with the latest tools that help them create and innovate. We contribute in this sense through many endeavors, such as encouraging research to be published in international and well reputed journals; ensuring our employees have exposure and access to various international sources of knowledge; adopting smart policies for managing intellectual property; and collaborating with start-ups and knowledge sharing partnerships.</p><p><strong>How does Dubai Municipality approach international collaboration and partnerships?<br></strong>The world has become very dynamic, and collaboration and strategic partnerships have become the fundamental tools to improve business outcomes. And strategic partnerships benefit everyone: businesses, governments, employees, and customers. It is a 360-degree win-win relationship. Dubai Municipality seeks collaboration with both local and international parties, as long as mutual benefits are realized. We also have our innovation partners, with whom we are open up to collaborate in different segments. Dubai Municipality also encourages collaboration and partnerships with SMEs and youth.</p><p><strong>What will be the impact of Expo 2020 on Dubai and the UAE?<br></strong>There will be a sustainable strategic spillover, what we are already calling the post-Expo impact. Through the expo, Dubai aims to embrace and incubate novel ideas and announce a number of unprecedented innovations that will shape the future of the world. On an economic level, we expect the Expo event period to contribute about 1.5% of GDP." About 25 million visitors are expected, contributing AED22.7 billion to GDP. 6<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How would you assess business prospects in Dubai?<br></strong>The market is picking up, albeit slowly. There are more prospects on the way, and Expo 2020 should add another boost. The expo's infrastructure will attract numerous industries and SMEs to participate in building country pavilions and museum projects across the region. 2020 and 2021 will be the time to engage in these projects, specifically supply chain ones. The oil price has been picking up, which is another positive sign. There is still, however, some fears of another drop. Nonetheless, we will see confidence returning to the market with the recent price stabilization. We are linked to the global market, and there is little to nothing that we can do to control it. We can only understand what is going on and adapt to certain trends and policies to boost our economic state and potential, but we remain positive.<br></p><p><strong>Which sectors are exhibiting the most growth and potential?<br></strong>Looking at the nature of the FDI that we attracted, there have been many inquiries and initial set ups regarding IoT and AI. I returned from South Korea, where there were numerous discussions among startups in the fields of AI solutions, IoT, and smart cities. Most of the companies see the need for such discussions. They keep a close eye on the GCC and more specifically the UAE, looking for the right moment to penetrate the market and establish their footprint. We are helping them bridge the gap to bring those solutions for key players and startups seeking to expand in the global market. The UAE, like Tokyo, is a testing ground for simulations of AI and other intelligent robotic solutions. </p><p><strong>How is increasing digitalization affecting business operations in Dubai?<br></strong>Such developments will be subject to the development of regulations. Many current business activities need to further unpack these technologies and the possible approval processes. We will be more engaged in the future as we bring more of these businesses and new technologies to the region; more governance is definitely required. The country is new to this, so I can see the culture and life cycle. During my visit to South Korea, I witnessed the lifestyle and engagement with AI, IoT, and smart things. This is because of their adaptation, which has undergone certain regulatory conditions over the years. Similarly, regulations need to be introduced in the UAE so that these new digital practices can become a part of everyday life, be it personal or in business engagement. I made another similar trip to Slush in Helsinki, organized by the Ministry of Economy of the UAE, where 40 delegate members, including inventors, startups, and other groups from the public and private sectors gathered to discuss future technologies. One highlight from that trip was Finland, which is highly advanced in terms of technology and the startup ecosystem. We even visited Marina 01, an inspiring project that converted a 200-year-old hospital into a total ecosystem to provide assistance and support to startups. Globally, The Corporate Group is linking with the most advanced countries to build classrooms for startups as part of an entire ecosystem. We want to attract such parties to come to the UAE to see how we can incubate them, allowing for commercial growth in the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How has the legal framework evolved to make it easier for a company to partner with a local player or establish themselves here?<br></strong>It is still hard to figure out the rules and regulations, because there are federal laws, state rule, and the laws that apply to the free zone. In some cases, it is clear how they interact with one another, as they have been doing it for years; however, in other cases it is just starting. Figuring out which law applies is difficult. It is not easy as a foreign entity to know where to go. Recently, there was a new law that allowed foreign entities to come in and set up 100%, but it was not clear which industries would be eligible. These are teething problems that will be resolved over time. However, unless there is a clear picture, then it becomes harder for entities to decide where they fit in. The easiest way around this is to set up a joint venture, where, over time, each company will decide how best to approach this.</p><p><strong>Will the Expo have more of an impact on travel or real estate?<br></strong>Travel will see more of an impact as we get closer to Expo, but where we feel an impact is the products that have to do with the infrastructure. Any company or service working on the infrastructure of Expo will benefit. If we look at the entire region and need excellent communication, transportation, housing, and ability to attract people from around the world, and a central location for your business then you would choose Dubai. Dubai does not only serve the UAE, but all the way from West Africa, Central Asian countries, and beyond to certain parts of Eastern Europe and the Indian Subcontinent. The rules and regulations here compared to the region are much easier to work with and much more internationalized. That makes it so attractive.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the real estate and construction sector in the UAE?<br></strong>When there is more supply than demand, prices go down, as there are significantly more choices. That is what is happening right now. There is demand, but it cannot keep up with the growth of supply in certain areas. Eventually, supply will match demand, and eventually demand will outstrip supply. Because there was so much demand while the price was so high, everyone was excited about the sector. That is why we ended up with an oversupply, and prices are now starting to go down. Real estate in Dubai is not collapsing but going from the natural tendency of under to oversupply. Since 2000, we have gone through that cycle twice. If you do not take advantage of that situation now, then it will be too late in one or two years.</p><p><strong>What highlights would you underline in technology development across your business lines?<br></strong>There is no way around technology. You cannot survive by building a moat around your castle. You have to embrace technology, though the question is to what degree you can defend it. If you are too early an adapter, then your product might be too expensive for customers; however, if you are too late, then someone else may have taken over the market. Most of our businesses are not in the consumer space, as the majority of our clients are B2B. As such, we look at the requirements of our business partners, suppliers, and end users. The hard part is figuring out where the next threat will come from. Having a USD1 billion war chest should put you in a favorable position, but if I have that while competing against companies that spend USD1 billion a day, then I cannot compete. Even a company set up in the e-commerce space here that thought USD1 billion would be enough to become a significant player is now discovering they have competitors in the market, and it is hard to overcome them. However, can they afford not to be in that area? That is the question. Digital can be beneficial and is not something you can fend off. We are fortunate to be living in a city such as Dubai. There are few cities or states that are trending toward being the first mover in the digital space. Dubai is one of them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is DAFZA's position within Dubai's industrial sector, and how does it contribute to the Emirate's industrial strategy?<br></strong>DAFZA supports Dubai's industrial sector growth and the Emirate's industrial strategy by aiming to increase the total output and value-addition of the industrial sector, enhance the Emirate's depth of knowledge and innovation, and make Dubai a preferred platform for global businesses. It also seeks to promote environmentally friendly and energy-efficient manufacturing and make Dubai a center for the global Islamic products. DAFZA is committed to all these objectives and has developed state of the art facilities that suit the needs of regional and global businesses from a range of sectors. Our contribution to Dubai's foreign trade reached 12% in the first nine months of 2019. The overall value of trade also reached AED120 billion, confirming the success of its plans to enhance its role in Dubai and to establish its presence amongst the free zones as one of the most developed, both nationally and globally. DAFZA also achieved a trade surplus of AED16.2 billion during the same period. The machinery and TV and electrical equipment section had the highest share of DAFZA's trade with a contribution of 53.4%. It was the main source of trade growth for both imports and exports, growing by 13% through the first nine months of 2019. DAFZA supports companies in expanding their businesses in the region by providing unique services at a strategic location, near Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest. The free zone has developed an advanced and modern infrastructure, which allows it to provide best-in-class services and incentives for businesses. Many leading international companies have established their regional headquarters in the free zone, such as Aerogen, ASAHI YUKIZAI, Airbus, Panasonic, Boeing, GE, Red Bull, and Heinz. This asserts the quality investment facilities and services that contribute to the success of any company at the regional and global level.</p><p><strong>How is DAFZA looking to expand upon opportunities in the halal space?<br></strong>DAFZA is a pioneering supporter of public and private sector efforts to strengthen Dubai's status as a global hub for foreign investment and Islamic economy and has played a major role in developing vital sectors in the emirate. This support was demonstrated by the free zone's launch of a comprehensive guide titled 'Dubai: The Global Gateway to Halal Industries,' which aims to catalyze foreign investors to help in understanding the Islamic economy and highlight trade opportunities in key halal sectors, such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, which are estimated at USD1.369 trillion, USD92 billion, and USD64 billion respectively. The guide has been extremely well received by international markets and is currently available in five different languages. As a part of our continued efforts, the second version of the much-demanded guide is currently under production and will be released in early 2020. DAFZA and the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC) also launched the first of its kind, the Halal Trade and Marketing Centre (HTMC). This is a global business development center focused on halal economic opportunities for manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors of halal products and services. It is hosted at DAFZA, but substantially supported by key partners across the halal ecosystem. This will be achieved by facilitating services in three key categories: market intelligence, halal compliance, and growth support services. The center aims to provide a platform to link halal-focused companies globally and support them in growing to the next level of their journey. It will also promote Dubai as a gateway for the global halal market, a business segment of more than 1.8 billion consumers, 57 OIC countries, and valued at more than USD2.2 trillion. As a result of numerous global interactions in 2019, many companies and institutions across the world are considering Dubai as the right place to set up their business for the halal market and work closely with the center, a key contributor to DIEDC's mandate in activating halal trade flows through Dubai. Having said that, HTMC will aggressively pursue its goals and planned activities in 2020, onboarding key service partners and engaging local food, pharma, and cosmetic industry players in addition to its international target markets, enabling them to tap into the fast-growing global halal market opportunity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been some milestones of Dubai SME?<br></strong>One was being able to bring our agenda of support and assistance to the SME sector to its highest level, increasing the saliency of SMEs in the vision and strategies that guide Dubai and the UAE's development. Having support from the top allowed us to create an effective ecosystem to work in, while establishing a high-level macro policy for SME development has also been a great achievement. After the establishment of Dubai SME, every other Emirate has emulated our actions. The direct injection of AED350 million (USD95.37million) in subsidies to SMEs that we support is a remarkable figure that also represents our success as an organization. Prior to 2002, Emirati graduates largely opted for employment and support, and guidance for entrepreneurs and start-ups was inadequate. Since 2002, the option to create one's own job and business has emerged. There were major gaps in the market when we started, and we had to create access to start-up finance, incubators, government projects, and subsidies as well as full legal support.</p><p><strong>How do you support Emirati SMEs in expanding their businesses globally?<br></strong>Internationalization requires different steps. We support businesses, from home start-ups up to businesses valued at AED250 million (USD68.12million). If they have domestic products, they focus on the UAE market. The more ambitious entrepreneurs build their ideas globally from the onset. The best place for such people is Dubai because of our connectivity. Dubai facilitates global connectivity in a myriad of ways, such as direct flights to all over the world. Within the ecosystem of the Department of Economic Development and Dubai SME, we also have Dubai Exports. We train businesses to a certain level and competency where they are able to export effectively. We then link them to Dubai Exports, which brings them to international markets.</p><p><strong>What types of SMEs in Dubai are currently exhibiting the most growth?<br></strong>Currently, the technology and services sectors show the most growth and potential for the near future. However, Dubai is a melting pot and is the most vibrant city in the region. The best talent across all sectors comes here for their start-ups to use Dubai as a base to develop into other markets. When it comes to women, we also have a strong base of female entrepreneurs who have successfully established themselves; however, the system we have created is not gender specific. Women are often more committed, especially when it comes to finance and payments. Today, 35% of our portfolio is women, a number that is expected to grow.</p><p><strong>What are the challenges in the market?<br></strong>The biggest challenge is the structural change in the economy. VAT completely changed the way people operate in 2018. Adjusting to the change is challenging for SMEs, the government, workers, and all other institutions and companies. It is a painful period of structural economic change, in addition to the geopolitical environment. Access to finance is not always easy for certain business sizes because of the banking sector's reluctance to give loans. Banks need to scale up their operations, training, and knowledge of SME finance. This is why we encourage businesses to use SME-related fintech to locate funds. The Mohammed Bin Rashid Fund under Dubai SME has also expanded its partnership with peer-to-peer lending platform Beehive to facilitate funding for our member SMEs. There is huge potential here, and we should not shy away from future opportunities. SMEs constitute 99.2% of the registered businesses in Dubai and employ 52.4% of Dubai's workforce. Within these challenges lie great opportunities. The market is truly suited to sellers, and now is the best time for the entrepreneurs in Dubai to set the tone. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Looking at the three pillars of the center's strategy—Islamic finance, the halal industry, and Islamic lifestyle—how is work under each pillar progressing?<br></strong>The three economic pillars of the DIEDC strategy were inspired by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, to transform Dubai into the global capital of the Islamic economy. The center's activities, initiatives, and projects feed into one or more of the three economic pillars to boost economic activity within each. Naturally, increasing the economic activity of Islamic economic sectors will increase the contribution of the Islamic economy to Dubai's GDP and help Dubai's efforts to economically diversify, further reinforcing the Emirate's position as a global Islamic economic capital. To complement these pillars, we devised three enabling pillars that are also part of the DIEDC strategy and provide the needed support to achieve our aim of boosting the Islamic economic contribution to Dubai's GDP. The first enabling pillar is knowledge, including research, education, and bridging the talent gap. The second is the Islamic digital economy, because we need to adapt to various trends that allow us to reach a wider audience more quickly and efficiently. If the Islamic economy sectors were to flourish, they would need to embrace technological and other innovative developments such as fintech. The third is the development of Islamic standards to govern economic activity. All 36 initiatives that have been launched feed into one or more of these six pillars. </p><p><strong>How do you measure the ways in which the Islamic economy contributes to Dubai?<br></strong>We have been working closely with the Dubai Statistics Center, a strategic partner of DIEDC, for some time now to develop the best ways to measure and quantify the contribution of Islamic economic sectors to Dubai's GDP. Initially, it wasn't easy to take these statistics and conduct an accurate analysis, since some of the sectors had experienced growth independent of the growth of the Islamic component. Therefore, we had to develop surveys and communications to gain a more nuanced perspective. DIEDC, in collaboration with other institutions, has been doing that for the last two years. Last year, for the first time, we issued the study of the Dubai Statistics Center on the contribution of the Islamic economy to Dubai's GDP. Measuring Islamic finance and internal halal trade in Dubai, the contribution to Dubai's GDP was close to AED31 billion as of 2016. In June 2019, we announced the new results with two new updates. First, the study was expanded to cover more than just Islamic finance and the halal trade, so some of the lifestyle components such as sharia-compliant food in hotels were measured, and other leisure activities were added. Some of the manufacturing was also measured, such as fabrics being produced that are used in sharia-compliant clothing. Taking into account the additions, the Dubai Statistics Center revised last year's study to make comparisons possible. Using the expanded scope, 2016 registered a contribution of AED39.9 billion, which increased to approximately AED41 billion in 2017, registering a growth rate of 2.4% and accounting for 10% of Dubai's GDP.</p><p><strong>How does DIEDC coordinate this contribution to GDP?<br></strong>We are committed to advocating for the Islamic economy and promoting Dubai as the global capital of the Islamic economy. In that regard, we work closely with our strategic partners to advocate for and implement various initiatives and projects. We also leverage our international network of industry stakeholders to ensure complete backing and support. For example, halal certification was unheard of three to four years ago. While most items that are imported into the UAE are sharia-compliant, companies did not go beyond in getting the halal stamp on their products. Now, a significant percentage of commodities in retail outlets are stamped with the UAE halal mark. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What role does Dubai FDI assume in coordinating a cohesive message to investors and other stakeholders?<br></strong>Dubai FDI continues to work toward improving Dubai's business environment and boost investor confidence in the Emirate. When we talk about Dubai, we talk about constant changes taking place, and at Dubai FDI we are committed to adopting these changes and transforming challenges into opportunities for investors. Today, Dubai FDI's responsibility toward leaders and investors lies in developing services, improving lives, and shaping the future of Dubai.</p><p><strong>Change is one of today's biggest challenges. How is Dubai FDI leading the transformation, and how do you assess the changing needs of investors and businesses interested in Dubai?</strong><br>Investors' needs are changing constantly, and IPAs should know how to adapt with these and even lead said change. Dubai has proactively put in place policies and strategies to lead future transformations. Our responsibility at Dubai FDI is to adopt these transformations and transform them into opportunities. At Dubai FDI, we take investors' needs into consideration as we facilitate connections between investors and government officials to support investor success, growth, and expansion in Dubai and across regional and global markets. Dubai's success in attracting new investors and retaining current ones underlines its economic diversity, readiness and openness to employ capital, innovation, technology, and talent across future economic sectors.</p><p><strong>Creating the city of the future will no doubt require building the best talent. What initiatives is Dubai FDI implementing to encourage mentorship and capacity building? </strong><br>Creating a talent ecosystem requires joint collective efforts by public and private sectors to address the requirements needed to address critical challenges, opportunities to develop, and retain and attract talent to stay competitive as an FDI destination. According to Dubai FDI Monitor, Dubai has succeeded in attracting 184 high and medium-technology projects worth AED19.98 billion, creating 12,641 jobs in the first nine months of 2019. These numbers are a testament to Dubai's having built a knowledge and innovation economy that is attracting and retaining talent. I also want to mention the Capacity 2030 program launched by the Hamdan Centre for the Future of Investment in partnership with WAIPA to enhance the capacity of IPAs to facilitate USD15 billion in FDI flows into Sustainable Development Goal-related projects by 2030.</p><p><strong>You recently described Dubai as the “chocolate fountain" of the region and the world, whereby others benefit from the spillover effects of its development. How does Dubai FDI integrate the Emirate's regional influence into its activities and developments?</strong><br>In the past few years, we have witnessed a significant rise in the number of FDI polices across the globe, which has led to FDI decreasing over the last few years. At the same time Dubai remained an attractive global FDI destination, open economy, and a gateway for global companies to expand in regional growth markets, not to mention a pivotal hub in the global economy. This is what increases investor confidence and demonstrates what Dubai FDI is doing to attract and retain investors in Dubai.</p><p><strong>As the current president of the World Association of Investment Promotion Agencies (WAIPA), how will the integration of WAIPA and Dubai help the latter grow? </strong><br>Dubai FDI has been working side-by-side with WAIPA to strengthen IPAs role in order to create new FDI opportunities and invest in building capacity needed to lead future transformations and attract impact FDI projects that will help achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Being elected president of WAIPA is another achievement for Dubai as it reflects the Emirate's position as one of the world's top FDI locations and its key role in leading future transformations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

In this regard, the issuance of the new FDI law is of great significance in terms of incentives provided to foreign investors in the country. The new law allows up to 100% foreign ownership of companies in select economic sectors, including agriculture, industry and services, innovation, technology, scientific research, and other creative fields. Most recently, the introduction of the “golden card" permanent residency scheme grants long-term residency status to investors, businessmen, and talented professionals. To further complement these efforts, local governments at the Emirate level have launched new packages of incentives and facilities to attract investment inflows into vital sectors. Among the most prominent of government decisions taken recently to stimulate the country's business environment is the cancellation of a mandatory bank guarantee for private sector companies once their employees' residence permits are confirmed. Instead, the new system of employment insurance will be worth AED60 annually, instead of AED3,000 for the previous bank guarantee. Apart from exempting transit tourists from all fees for the first 48 hours, facilities have been granted for those wishing to obtain employment opportunities in the country, through a temporary residency permit for a period of six months without fees. There is also a provision for talented students to extend their residency for two years after graduation, which will allow them to explore their options in the country.</p><p><strong>How does the rising level of trade protectionism throughout the world affect the strategic planning of the ministry? <br></strong>Protectionist trade policies have adverse effects on global trade in general, and we are not immune to it. Considering our strong partnerships with the US and China, the UAE is keen to remain impartial and hopes that a consensus will be reached because it hinders global trade. The UAE remains committed to pursuing a policy of openness and partnership with various countries. This approach is based on our strong belief in the values of openness and eradicating barriers, which will enable us to protect the country's commercial interests, thereby limiting the impact of these tensions on the UAE's economy. Simultaneously, we will continue to work with friendly and partner countries to revoke trade restrictions through bilateral, regional, or global legislation and agreements. Exploration of new economic destinations and diverse markets to increase UAE's exports, promote re-exports, and diversification of destinations for imports to build stronger trade partnerships and broader economic cooperation is another major focus area. In addition, we are continuing our efforts to find solutions to the problems arising from protectionist policies through consultative channels and mechanisms adopted by WTO. To facilitate the access of UAE exports to international markets, the Ministry of Economy supports the movement of Emirati goods to foreign markets through the National Committee for Export Development, which has the membership of all federal and local authorities concerned with this vital sector. The ministry also participates in many meetings and platforms, most notably joint economic committees, that bring countries together with trade partners in order to enable the private sector to explore trade opportunities and new markets, and successfully address challenges. </p><p><strong>Over the next decade, what role do you see the UAE playing in the Belt and Road Initiative, and what advantages will this bring to the national economy?</strong><br>Since the BRI's inception, the UAE has been actively participating in all forums and activities associated with it. A number of promising development projects have been announced in connection with the BRI as well. Furthermore, the UAE's expertise and accumulated experience in the field of logistics services and successful experiences in areas such as free zones, infrastructure, and port management are also being leveraged to ensure the success of these projects. Futhermore, China has invested nearly USD64 billion in countries located along the BRI between 2014 and 2017, with two of the megaprojects in the UAE. The UAE recently launched the World Logistics Passport initiative to open new paths for trade between the East with the West and enhance Dubai's and the UAE's ability to support global trade and economy. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As the Chairman of ICC-WCF, how are mitigating uncertainty and finding new opportunities for business continuity?<br></strong>The world is in the midst of challenging times as COVID-19 disrupts lives, societies and businesses globally. During times of uncertainty, the priority of the ICC-WCF is to ensure the smooth continuity of work, and to mitigate any negative impact on the business sector through open dialogue with both the public and private sectors. As the representative of 45 million companies, one billion employees, in more than 100 countries, the ICC-WCF plays a critical part in mobilizing efforts to support chambers globally. Our role is to assure chambers worldwide that we are here to support them in finding innovative solutions for business continuity. This involves fostering awareness of their function in ensuring businesses adhere to the guidelines set out by their respective governments.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the country's response to the pandemic, and what has been Dubai Chamber's role? <br></strong>The UAE has employed a successful strategy in introducing comprehensive testing while protecting business continuity. Analysis of global pandemic data conducted by Deep Knowledge Group, a consortium of commercial and non-profit organizations, placed the UAE among the top five countries for testing and within the top 10 for treatment efficiency, which is judged on a country's ability to monitor the spread of the virus, treat patients, and develop, test and deploy potential vaccines and treatments. Beyond its borders, the UAE has launched an international 'air bridge' in partnership with the UN World Food Programme, designed to deliver essential health and humanitarian supplies to nations in need. The partnership will supply items to more than 100 countries in the months ahead. Closer to home, the UAE responded swiftly to unprecedented changes in the world of work. Dubai Chamber underwent a full smart transformation, with 100% remote working introduced in March and 100% of its services made available online, providing a seamless transition to digital business and ensuring no interruption to service for members. Expanding on its smart transformation, Dubai Chamber also launched a series of webinars to disseminate information to members.</p><p><strong>How is Dubai Chamber working to facilitate high levels of public-private sector collaboration? <br></strong>Internationally, Dubai Chamber is working closely with the authorities in the 10 countries in which it has a presence to implement global best practice, minimize the risk of transmission, and ensure business continuity with stakeholders. Dubai Chamber remains committed to activating PPPs during this time to respond to global challenges. In early May, it organized a virtual meeting of 30 business-community representatives, chaired by HH Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed, which included open discussion about the challenges and effects of COVID-19 on the business sector and wider economy. Private-sector representatives affirmed their confidence in the government measures that have proven effective in containing the virus, mitigating its spread and protecting lives, while preserving the economy. In addition, a March meeting with business groups and councils resulted in an economic incentive package that reflects the UAE's commitment to the interests of investors. An additional economic stimulus package will be implemented to improve competitiveness in the private sector. Combined, these measures communicate a strong message to the private sector: we stand by the interests of investors—and will work to grow their investments, provide a secure environment conducive to growth, and remain alongside them in the face of global challenges.  Let us be optimistic about the future. Let us take this opportunity to thank our courageous and dedicated health professionals. Let us look out for one another. By pulling together and proceeding with unity, we will emerge stronger. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>With Expo  approaching, Dubai is bringing the planet together at a single destination, and we are well on track to bring you the world's greatest show of human brilliance and achievement. As we recently found from the results of the Dubai-commissioned Global Optimism Outlook Survey, the first such survey in the world, people around the globe are unified by a desire for a more collaborative, inclusive, tolerant, clean, and stable planet. We aim to help meet those laudable desires by presenting the most inclusive and international World Expo in history, thus reinforcing the UAE's status as a connecting hub for the globe and a place that, as of October 1, 2021, will see 192 participating countries converge, collaborate, and strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations. We will present an enthralled world-within-a-world for visitors to explore, highlighting the wonders of each of these 192 nations with no need for a passport. </p><p>World Expos have long prided themselves on being catalysts for change, showcasing ground-breaking innovations that impact the world today to this day and sparking discussions that have changed the course of history. Visitors to Expo 2020 will witness new acts of human genius and see what's next in art, music, food, and tech from around the planet. Across a span of six months, we will welcome more than 200 participants and an estimated 25 million visits. As the first World Expo in the region, for six months, all eyes will be on the UAE as it delivers an exceptional Expo that entertains, enlightens, and unites. It will be the 'be there' moment of our time.</p><p>Staging such a large-scale, global event is an unrivaled opportunity to showcase our dynamism and hospitality and highlight our vision of the future as we carry this innovative and collaborative spirit forward for generations to come. Hosting it also presents the UAE with a huge social opportunity to inspire and empower millions of visitors, whether it is discovering ways we can pull together to nurture our natural resources at Terra, the sustainability pavilion, or exploring how we can unlock everyone's potential at the opportunity pavilion.</p><p>There is more, however, to our ambitions than six months of world-class entertainment and enjoyment. Our goal from the very beginning—even before 2013, when Dubai won the right to stage the event—has been to ensure Expo 2020 leaves behind a meaningful and lasting legacy after doors close.. We are committed to extending its benefits beyond the six months of the event and beyond the UAE to the wider region and rest of the world. Not only are we hosting a spectacular mega-event to impress the world, we are also making a long-term investment in the future of our country—one that will significantly boost the UAE's economy, spur growth, and support jobs for many years to come. </p><p>The next 12 months will be an enthralling journey, but there will also be many significant milestones in the days and weeks ahead. We are making great progress, and it is truly exciting to see the transformation of the Expo 2020 site from a barren desert to a global hub for celebration, inspiration, and innovation. We have already completed the three thematic districts, and the construction of the remaining permanent developments are on track to be finished by the end of 2019. This summer, there was incredible demand for 'The World's Greatest Show in the Making' tour, which saw more than 3,300 people snap up all the available seats on bus tours of the Expo 2020 site, with overwhelmingly positive feedback on their experiences.</p><p>It will be just one in a series of opportunities for everyone to be part of the Expo 2020 story. There will be more exciting events and activities in the run up to us welcoming the world, and as event time draws near, we will be revealing more of the thrilling programming that we will be packing into our global celebration. Expo 2020 is something truly historic, not just for Dubai and the UAE, as we approach our nation's golden jubilee, but for the entire world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the biggest challenges to doing business in the country? </h4><p>Mozambique lost three places in the World Bank's 2019 Index of Doing Business. While the slight fluctuation in ranking should not be taken too seriously, there are important gains to be made by rationalizing the overall regulatory framework, transferring good practices from some parts of the economy to others. The country needs a more straightforward procedure for work permits, registration of companies and building permits. Besides these problems at the micro-level, we would like to encourage the government to take a comprehensive view on legal frameworks in PPPs and infrastructure projects, in order to streamline the process for investors and crowd in private capital, at a time when the public budget will remain under pressure for some years. The government must take leadership of designing and driving a national program for infrastructure development and energy, with set criteria and standards, and use as far as possible transparent and competitive processes to select developers and implementers, moving away from an approach based mostly on unsolicited bids. These are necessary if the government wants to attract top players. There are already some examples, notably in the energy sector, where significant efficiency and cost gains have been achieved for the consumer thanks to such an approach. The local private sector needs to be more proactive in seeking opportunities, innovate more aggressively and seek transfer of knowledge and technology This is a relatively young private sector that needs to consolidate its competitiveness and be able to face the markets.</p><h4>How does the AfDB articulate its mandate in Mozambique? </h4><p>The AfDB focuses on five priorities at the continental level: Feed Africa, that is turning Africa into a net exporter of processed agriculture commodities; Light up Africa, achieving universal energy access; increasing industrial GDP; Integrating Africa, interconnecting African economies and standardizing regulatory frameworks; and Improving quality of life for the people of Africa, creating job and developing skills for the youth. Our focus in Mozambique is to support the government in developing a sufficiently diversified economic base to generate inclusive growth and avoid the resource course scenario, once gas production begins. One of the main pillars of our strategy is agricultural transformation: we want to link agriculture and agro-business to the global markets, strengthen the value chains. While talking about agriculture, also gas has a direct input into agriculture through fertilizer, if the right policy and investment environment is there to actually develop a downstream value chain for this type of gas. A key concern for the transformation of agriculture is climate resilience — an issue that was made all but obvious by Cyclone Idai and major floods that occurred in the last months. These include investments in water harvesting and technologies for basin and reservoir water collection and the distribution of solar-powered irrigation kits. Most of these projects are directed to small-scale farmers and farmers' associations. Looking forward, we want to move one notch up the value chain to have fully-fledged agro-industrial parks. To support agricultural transformation, our second pillar of investment focuses on enabling infrastructures, notably transport, to connect producers to markets, and energy, to support processing.</p><h4>Can you explore in detail one of the projects you support? </h4><p>We invested USD300 million of our own resources in the USD5 billion in Nacala Corridor Railway, which connects the Moatize Mines to Nacala Port through Malawi. The railway enables the transportation of coking coal, used for steel production, from the mines to the port for export. Crucially, while the capacity of the railway is 18 million tons of coal per year, it also has a 6 million tons per year of general cargo capacity. This is a private sector investment, done entirely on a banking basis without any government money or public guarantee; revenues from the coal mine will finance the railway, a public service. The idea is to fundamentally create a logistics corridor to ship commodities out of Malawi, Zambia, and Mozambique; there is a lot of potential for resource interconnection between these countries. Zambia, for example, is increasingly importing fuel through this corridor, at a lower cost than before the project was completed. We have extractive resources that we are monetizing through taxation and exports. However, we need to build on these experiences to make sure to create direct linkages between the domestic economy and the natural resource projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have your operations evolved since opening in 1987, and what are DHL's operations in Morocco today like?</h4><p>We were the first express company to operate in Morocco since 1987. We started as small shop and went on to become one of the top 150 companies in Morocco today. Our staff, assets, clients and volumes have grown substantially during that time. Our main focus is still to be the partner and provider of choice in order to reinforce our position as leader in the market by offering the best service quality to our customers.</p><h4>What is the strategy behind your facility expansion in Tangier?</h4><p>Tangier is becoming the fastest-growing area in Morocco. As a logistics company, we have to follow and listen to the voices of both businesses and customers and invest where the need is in order to be very close to our customer and provide the best solutions. Today we are the only express logistics company with a warehouse in Tangier. The warehouse is 1,800sqm, and we have a daily weekday freight aircraft Airbus 300 that lands there in the morning and takes off in the afternoon with a capacity of more than 60 tons per day.</p><h4>What are the most important sources of revenue for DHL here?</h4><p>In Morocco B2B is still the dominant contributor to our revenue at more than 80%. Our different offers suite the market needs and our customers' portfolio is rich and variant, wherever we can have additional revenue we will operate and offer our services. We serve the automotive, aeronautic, banking and financial, textile, handy-craft and logistics sectors for example. We are here to answer to market needs whether it is B2B or B2C. We invested in many cities and regions from north to south of the kingdom and we are happy to offe  our services at 20 service points and express centers.</p><h4>Will e-commerce grow further in Morocco?</h4><p>Yes it will, indeed we noticed during the last couple of years that e-commerce in Morocco is growing in both ways “Import and Export." With regard to import we are as a compliant company working hand-in-hand with local authorities to ease the use of e-commerce shipments to Moroccan customers. On the other hand we offer our expertise, knowledge, and infrastructure to our customers to help them selling their goods to their customers sited abroad. The world today is more oriented to digitalization and e-commerce is seen to be the digital market for the future. With recent upgrade of hard currency allowance from foreign exchange office we can expect that inbound e-commerce shipment will increase further, in parallel the increasing number of new startups is an encouraging sign that e-commerce will also increase in export. We in DHL Express are ready to serve and support this increasing business by giving advice based on our own experience in Morocco and worldwide, by offering the largest coverage of the kingdom in terms of infrastructure and staff, the largest international network covering 220 countries and territories. We also support our customers in terms of IT and selling advice. As a logistics company, we have to listen to the market, and for the time being B2C is one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.</p><h4>How will the digital revolution change the market in Morocco?</h4><p>Morocco is affected by digitalization as much as anywhere in the world. Our daily challenge is to make our customers' lives easier by giving them the opportunity to manage and access information immediately, and the digital revolution is offering this and will continue to positively push  markets. This will help mainly in terms of time and cost saving and in terms of fluent and fast communication. We have seen the massive use of new technologies like smartphones, and the importance of social media. Another important aspect  of digitalization is robotics, and DHL now has three innovation centers globally oriented toward new technologies. The last one opened this year in the US. We provide our customers with the newest technology available.</p><h4>What are your requirements for your human resources, and what measures did you take to win the best employer award?</h4><p>Our main question is: what can DHL do to improve your life? Once we make sure we motivate our people, then the workforce will recognize the efforts made by DHL. Since then being best employer and top employer becomes logic retribution and we are proud to be in this position. It is definitely a challenge to be top employer for two years in a row. It is even more difficult to sustain this recognition and improve our employees' life. We are looking for excellence through different programs and will continuously work every year, month, week, and day to make sure today is better than yesterday. Our workforce is our main differentiator, our power to deliver the best quality of service that our customers expect from us.</p><h4>What have been your efforts regarding sustainability and green practices in the country?</h4><p>We engage our employees through different initiatives across three programs. One of them is Go Teach, and this year we were happy to go to an area in Labrouj 200km from Casablanca to refurbish a public school there. We went there again with our employees to make sure things have been done and are sustained. We have another program Go Help, which has not less than 20 activities that we do on an annual basis. Last but not least is our program Go Green where we plant trees, contribute to reduce CO2 emission and usage of paper to make sure we are focused on the environment. Go Green, Go Help, and Go Teach are global programs that were launched a few years ago, and we continue to apply and leave them in Morocco.</p><h4>What is your main goal for the company in 2020?</h4><p>We are in a good shape so we will not change much of what we have done so far. We will continue to take care of our employees, focus on quality, and listen to our customers and make sure we are their first choice whenever they think about logistics. In Morocco, we will continue to invest in our people and in our infrastructure listening to the voices of employees, voices of customers, and voices of business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the UK's expectations for President Nyusi's second mandate?</h4><p>We would like to commend President Nyusi for his strong leadership during the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, which kicked in just 2 months after his re-election. From a bilateral perspective, we have a good relationship with the Mozambican government, and we are looking to deepen that relationship during president Nyusi's second mandate. Our relationship has traditionally been tilted toward development; however, we have been increasingly focusing on building a true partnership based on strong commercial and cultural ties. Our aim is to unlock mutually beneficial economic opportunities and sustainable jobs for Mozambique's talented youth, so to be active part of the country's positive story. From a political perspective, we have closely followed the whole peace process. It was a privilege to witness the signing of the cessation of hostilities between FRELIMO and RENAMO in Gorongosa and to see both parties present and publicly reiterating their commitment to peace when the Pope visited in September 2019. We hope that the second mandate is an opportunity to cement and complete the whole disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) process, putting an end to the attacks in the center of the country and to leaving this chapter behind Mozambique once and for all.</p><h4>How has the UK-Africa Summit redefined the UK's role in Africa, and what were the outcomes for Mozambique?</h4><p>First, we thank President Nyusi for attending that summit as it was only one week after being sworn in. He brought a strong delegation to the conference with a clear message about Mozambique's priorities and where they saw our relationship aligning. While gas will play a pivotal role in Mozambique's next future, we want to unlock potentials in other sectors to push for a sustainable growth. In this regard, we identified interesting opportunities in sectors such as agri-business, renewable energy, and SME development. Moreover, we were keen to see the summit produce concrete outcomes, such as the announcement of a GBP100-million trade finance facility by Absa bank and CDC to support SMEs in five countries including Mozambique, or the UK's commitment to provide GBP40 million to support the agriculture sector, in addition to the GBP17 million injected into the African network of Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) initiatives to support financial inclusion. The UK has also committed to scale up female economic empowerment programs such as Mover, to ensure that young women partake in the gas sector's eventual success. The endpoint of the UK-Africa Summit is to build a mutually beneficial relationship with the African continent, and Mozambique has the potential to be one of the beacons in this framework.</p><h4>What are the most prominent areas of trade between the UK and Mozambique?</h4><p>We are excited for the future of the gas sector and for the opportunities it will offer to UK companies. There are already a number of UK companies involved in other sectors, from agriculture to renewables to manufacture, and so on. We have seen our total trade in goods and services between the UK and Mozambique increase by over 45% in the last quarters to 2019. An important sector where we want to increase our investments is technology: the digital economy and fintech are in their infancy in Mozambique, with great room to expand. People in Africa are quick to embrace technology, creating an amazing potential for technology leapfrogging.</p><h4>How should the international community and the UK shape their response to assist the government against the growing insurgency in Cabo Delgado?</h4><p>Stability and security in Cabo Delgado is of the utmost importance to the UK government. The UK signed a defense MoU in May 2019 with the government of Mozambique, and we continue to work in partnership to address security issues of mutual concern. While we remain concerned about security, we need to respect the sovereignty of the nation to address the insurgency in a humanitarian way, but there is plenty of help the international community can provide. The immediate priority is addressing the humanitarian assistance required to support the thousands of displaced people who were directly affected by the insurgency. This is all the more urgent given that until recently ï›May 2020ï half the cases of COVID-19 in Mozambique originated from the Cabo Delgado province. We are working on with the Minister for Social Protection and the international community, through partners and NGOs, to make sure assistance is provided. From a more long-term perspective, it is key to address the socio-economic inequalities in the north to mitigate tensions and limit the spread of the insurgency. We commend the Mozambican government, which recently announced the creation of the Integrated Development Agency of the North (ADIN) to foster the economic development of the north, including Cabo Delgado. The international community must work with the government to come up with a strategic plan to make sure that resources produced by the gas industry are invested in Cabo Delgado's economy to create real jobs for the youth and a real alternative to crime or insurgency as a deterrent. Agriculture and agri-business will undoubtedly be the focus of this strategy, as more than 70% of the population works in this sector, and the LNG industry will bring growth in demand for food and agricultural produce.</p><h4>You are celebrated as the first black female High Commissioner for the UK. Why is it important to tell this story?</h4><p>The world is currently undergoing a profound movement of change, prompted by racial tensions. It is in moments like these that I remember why it is important to tell this story. It is important to be able to see yourself in different walks of life, and by representing the UK abroad, I can contribute to changing the international perception about what the UK is and looks like. In my opinion, one of the greatest gifts the UK offers is a rich and diverse diaspora that forms part of its human capital. The UK is not only Downtown Abbey; our strength is our diversity, and we must recognize this. I do not know why it took this long to have a black female High Commissioner, but I hope it can inspire other black children to aspire to fulfill their dreams regardless of skin color or social class, and that ten years from now it will not be so unique to see a black diplomat in the UK.</p><h4>From a personal perspective, what makes you excited about Mozambique's future? </h4><p>Mozambique is a young country demographically, and it deserves a bright future. As 2019's cyclones and regular droughts sadly prove, Mozambique is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world, and it should address sustainability as a central priority of its future. If we start offering the opportunity, there is great potential to see the growth of sustainable entrepreneurship models and create a sustainable future. I have been personally involved in “Green is the New Black," a project about sustainable fashion. The clothing industry is one of the highest contributors to global pollution, so it is important we change the way we do fashion. This project is also a way to support entrepreneurship for talented youths without the means to start their career. We started with 10 youths, who have done different trainings online and have had an amazing virtual exhibition of their pieces. Some of them are currently making the capulana (traditional Mozambique sarong) masks that we see everywhere in the streets. Some have even started providing sustainable designs for larger designers here.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How long has Doka had a presence in Qatar and what are some of its notable projects?</h4><p>Doka Qatar was formally established in 2004, albeit its first project was delivering a water tank project almost 35 years ago in 1985. Since then the company has grown from seven people in 2004 to over 100 today. As one of the world's most advanced formwork and scaffolding specialists, Doka Qatar has worked on several of the country's most prestigious projects, most notably Doha International Airport, Lusail City, Sidra Medical Centre and The Pearl.</p><h4>What are the benefits and added value that Doka brings to companies in Qatar's construction sector?</h4><p>When it comes to formwork and scaffolding, our greatest strength is engineering. Doka puts a lot of energy into its technical solutions and ensuring a high level of service. Historically we are a pan-European business, however, when we work in different regions around the world we adapt to the environment while retaining our core solutions. Having worked with Doka for over a decade, I believe we are a global leader when it comes to delivering complex projects. As part of our value-add we offer sophisticated, technical solutions with fast access to materials and back-up services. Our sales engineers, back office and site teams place an emphasis on providing the maximum amount of support to our clients; in short, with engineering solutions the biggest contribution really comes down to productivity on site. This is crucial to saving money and being aware of safety. I would say holistically, this is where we add the most value. Having large premises with quick access to materials means we can offer a highly flexible and efficient service.</p><h4>What is your current assessment of Qatar's construction sector?</h4><p>Coming from South Africa and having worked in the construction industry during the build up to its World Cup in 2010, I have seen how this trend typically works and my initial assessment is that Qatar is in a similar place. There is still a lot of preparation work to be done, but things are moving at the right pace. It will be more challenging than it was before, specifically for structural work, however, we are involved in a diverse range of sectors, including oil and gas and the industrial sector. With the slowdown in H1/2019, the construction sector has pressure to pick up the pace in order to meet its 2022 deadlines. I see positive trends in 2020-2021. If we look at the Qatar's National Vision 2030, the plan is to maintain the economy after the World Cup; the question is what that means for our industry? The likelihood is the high volumes of work that we've seen in advance of the World Cup won't continue, particularly when many of the projects currently being completed are for long term infrastructure, such as the Metro, Airport and roads. In the near term the airport extension will be a great project to work on so I would say I am cautiously optimistic and excited to see where the economy goes post-2022.</p><h4>What opportunities does the expansion of QP's LNG trains offer Doka?</h4><p>The industrial sector, including oil &amp; gas is relatively new for us however; the Ras Laffan expansion is certainly relevant to our business model. One of our most recent and popular products has been DokaScaff UNI, a ringlock scaffolding system designed to save time and money, while providing considerable safety for site teams. We recently completed a roadshow that showcased our product to site teams across the country, allowing contractors and consultants to better understand the system's features. The feedback has been very positive, not only illustrating the demand for evolving scaffolding as a product, but furthermore diversifying our business model. Certainly Qatar's carbon energy is a robust sector and we look forward to working more closely with it.</p><h4>What can Doka bring to the market in terms of innovation and increased efficiency?</h4><p>Since our establishment over 150 years ago, Doka has always placed an emphasis on R&amp;D. We try to find ways to improve the productivity of the greater construction industry through technology. We've recently launched the first e-commerce store for formwork in Qatar, which not only makes ordering easy, but allows us to pass on big savings in time and money to our clients. Another excellent example of innovation is our award-winning product, Concremote; a device that monitors the maturity of concrete using live data from sensors placed directly into the concrete. The sensors keep the site or project manager informed in real time via their smartphone or tablet devices and alerts them once the concrete has reached its perfect strength, thereby prompting deshuttering at the earliest opportunity. In terms of innovation, Doka also has a global sustainability strategy, something that is highly important to us.</p>
<p>About Doka</p><p>Doka, a subsidiary of the Umdasch Group is one of the world's largest manufacturers and suppliers of formwork products and systems with more than 160 sales and logistics facilities in over 70 countries. From its headquarters in Austria, Doka's heritage of innovation has positioned itself as a front-runner in creating disruptive technologies for the construction market, with an emphasis firmly placed on supporting the needs of its clients. Covering some of the fastest developing economies in the global construction market, Doka Middle East &amp; Africa's office oversees operations from Cairo to Istanbul. Based from its regional headquarters in Dubai, which includes both offices and a distribution center, Doka Middle East &amp; Africa's operation has been structured to provide maximum agility for its subsidiaries, allowing it to react quickly to market changes and to extend the highest levels of support for its clients. Doka Middle East &amp; Africa's office covers the following subsidiaries: United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Egypt. This organization also supports projects across Northern Africa and Central Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some promising ongoing collaborations, and what value do they bring to your company?</h4><p>Locally, we have partnered with companies like OCP and Managem. OCP is in the #1 exporter of phosphate and its derivatives in the world and Managem is a global player in the mining sector. From manufacturing spare parts for pumps for industrial users as well as OEMs, we are also a manufacturer of pumps. This project was a core development with OCP, which did the engineering of the pump, while we did the manufacturing of the parts. The pumps have been successfully tested and are operating on the field. We were essentially a manufacturer of replacement parts with reverse engineering capabilities. We have for the last ten years managed to diversify our customer base and serve OEMs with pump parts in the dredging industry in many geographical areas of the world as well in mining. We collaborate with their engineering department and have the advantage of manufacturing répétitive series instead of unit parts as in the replacement market. We deliver up to four tons pump casings in heavy-duty material all over the world including the Netherlands, Germany, France, Algeria, Tunisia, sub-Saharan Africa, and the Middle East. It represents 50% of our sales. More generally, we have three main activities within the Mafoder group: steel and cast-iron foundry products, prefabricated concrete, and outdoor furniture.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in the development of your business?</h4><p>We do a great deal of product development because bringing new products with better performance to the market is necessary to remain the leader. We regularly introduce products which meet ISO standards and which actually solve problems for end users. We entered the prefabricated concrete business because the construction of underground networks, under the manhole covers we manufacture, was of poor quality. Instead of pouring concrete on site to build the manholes, they would be prefabricated in a factory. This was a revolution since we brought a standardized solution for an equipment that could be installed on construction sites with efficiency, ease and a proven quality. It was a product in concrete that was closely associated with our ductile iron covers, although in a different material and technology.It helped us strengthen our position on the market because we were combining our services into a more integrated approach and solution. In terms of urban furniture, we did the shelters for the Casablanca tram, which was a big project for us. We transferred our know-how of foundry and concrete to this new business line thanks to our experience in material shaping. Foundry involves heavy-duty parts with high value added from casting, machining, and heat treatment.It is very challenging. For the replacement market in Morocco, the market for steel castings is very fragmented.Most of the time a customer brings in in a new replacement part to manufacture ,we have to take the measurements and create the drawings and then cast, machine, heat treat, validate, and test the parts. This has taught us how to respond quickly to this fragmented demand on the market. To better serve our customers, we have developed rapid prototyping techniques in order to reduce time to market. We gained great agility over time and we can say that innovation was always part of our DNA because it meets the values we cherish such as freedom to create and full commitment in our endeavors.</p><h4>What are the main struggles that companies face in the sector?</h4><p>The rigidity of the labor laws means that over time you need to restructure your workforce. Severance packages are costly and there is little flexibility in hiring people on a limited basis. It is also difficult to bring in talent because the education system is not efficient, and training institutes do not really target the specific needs of the foundry sector. The younger generation has sometimes unrealistic expectations that we cannot meet because they seem impatient to take responsibilities. The problem is that Morocco has opened its borders to many countries with free trade agreements which creates a big problem for the local industry. The local companies cannot face open competition without government support because our market is too small and input costs are not always favorable. Tenders are designed in a way that does not allow Moroccan companies to compete. I also do not see much help from the government in supporting local SMEs.</p><h4>As a member of the board of EFE Maroc, what measures has the organization taken to address youth unemployment?</h4><p>We have provided extensive training on soft skills because this was lacking in the market. We needed to improve communication skills and the attitudes of the youth on how to orientate their careers, seek opportunities in the market, write their CVs, prepare for interviews, find jobs, and improve their capacity to integrate the job market once they are hired. Sometimes, they have high expectations, are impatient, do not know what the environment they are landing in is like, or do not know how to resolve conflicts. We look at how we can inspire them to be great employees and present themselves properly. We have the privilege to be part of an international network in the US, Europe and the Middle East. We have been partnering with companies such as Master card , Accenture, Citibank, Boeing, Chanel, and CDG on coding. Over a 10-year period, 50,000 people have been trained. We have about 450 coaches that are EFE certified trainers, and we have trained people all over Morocco.</p><h4>What are the goals for the group in the upcoming year?</h4><p>We will continue to focus on our exiting business and increase our volume with European OEMs .We have recently acquired a major world renowned certification from the Meehanite Corporation that puts us in a great position to develop our business within the phosphate industry. In terms of urban furniture, we plan to work more with designers and architects to develop new lines of products. We have plans to be much more involved in the supply of solutions to urban planning. We will increase our presence in the arts and cultural scene. We are great believers in how the industry can collaborate with art. It needs to find its expression in our community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you explain the role and mission of FSD Mozambique?</h4><p>Financial Sector Deepening Moçambique (FSDMoç) was established in 2014 with the aim to support and facilitate the development of inclusive financial markets in Mozambique, with UK DFID and Sweden Sida support. FSDMoç recognizes the need for a greater focus on financial sector offering quality services that enable resilience and economic empowerment for all Mozambicans. To this end, it conducts research, evidence, and data analysis to help market actors to better understand the needs of (demand side) smallholder farmers, small businesses, women, youth and rural communities. This way, it contributes to the provision of knowledge and know-how to our partners and others, to build the business case for providing appropriate, affordable and accessible financial services and products. We work in close collaboration with government agencies and authorities, regulators, private sector actors, and development partners to support the development of a financial sector (banking, non-banking players including insurance, mobile wallets, and capital market) that meaningfully addresses the needs of low-income people and smaller and medium enterprises.</p><h4>What progress have you seen in recent years in terms of financial inclusion in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique has a National Financial Inclusion Strategy (2016-2022). This is a strong signal that the country recognizes the importance of financial inclusion for the social and economic development of the country and its citizens. The last financial inclusion consumer survey (Finscope 2014) data, showed that only about of 20% of adult Mozambicans had a bank account. Based on this information a joint effort from the government, regulators, financial service providers, and other organizations like FSDMoç work together to contribute to the improvement of financial inclusion indicators. We understand financial inclusion in three dimensions, namely access, usage and quality of people's life. We are now analyzing Finscope 2019 data and we expect good news. Another source is the Financial Inclusion Report 2018 produced by the Central Bank which indicates an improvement on access to bank account by 32% of the adult population and more than 50% uses Mobile Money accounts. Other interesting fact is that both banks and insurance companies are increasingly offering digital solutions, extending their services far beyond the limits of their physical presence. We are also working on insurance penetration to respond to the needed of low-income segments. Despite these visible achievements, we still have more to do, particularly when it comes to as areas like: (i) increasing the usage of financial services and products; (ii) access to capital markets as an alternative finance sources for SMEs; (iii) financial products must be practical; (iv) financial inclusion must improve the quality of life. In the area of innovation, in 2018 the Central Bank, in partnership with FSDMoç, launched a regulatory sandbox— the 2nd in Africa. This initiative is promoting innovations developed by Fintech companies, under the supervision of the central bank, to strengthen the regulatory approaches necessary to be supportive and adaptive to those innovations. FSDMoç is also building the Fintech Ecosystem through the establishment of a Fintech Association and the provision of technical assistance and capacity strengthening on digital financial services. The central bank has recently launched the 2nd edition of the sandbox. Financial inclusion must also address issues of practicality of the service, in other words whether the financial services respond to a general demand and whether the beneficiaries have the means to use that service. The expansion of mobile money and emergency of a new category of actors, such as fintech payment aggregators, plays a key role in this. Financial inclusion is inextricably linked to development; in this area, we still have a long way to go. While the work of FSD initially favored access to services, this quality of life angle on financial inclusion is becoming increasingly important in our work. We are now trying to respond to how we link to the sustainable development goals and climate change and financial inclusion.</p><h4>What are the priorities for FSD in 2020?</h4><p>We do have a new strategy called FSD 2.0—which is a new phase of financial sector development. FSD2.0 is the name given to the new guiding vision adopted by the Financial Sector Deepening (FSD) Network in 2019, composed of 10 FSD in Africa, in order to express our view of contributing more to the second (usage) and third (quality of life) dimensions of financial inclusion. Our priority for 2020 is whereby we intend to focus on sustainable development and agriculture, the primary source of employment in the country. The need to expand levels of people's and companies' access to formal financial services in Mozambique. Under the new FSD 2.0, the priority areas are: (i) Investments, in this area the development of the capital market will be a key dimension, (ii) access/usage, the digitalization as a mechanism to reach underserved people with impairment from financial and basic services (iii) stability and integrity with more emphasis on data privacy and protection, digital ID, cybersecurity (iv) innovation. The academic community should play an important role in strengthening digital financial service professionals, equipping them with skills and technologies such as the blockchain and artificial intelligence. We started this year taking part in the UK-Africa summit, whereby our financial support from the UK government was renewed for the next five years. This commitment represents the start of an important new approach to financial sector development in sub-Saharan Africa. The package from UK Aid recognizes that a comprehensive, integrated approach to financial market development in Africa is required to realize the continent's potential and help meet the United Nation's global goals. We will continue work with all the key players and with our partners in the development of more inclusive affordable financial products and service which address the needs to the majority of the Mozambicans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of IPSEN Logistics since starting activities in Morocco in 1995 under the name of Compagnie d'Emballage et Transport Maritime?</h4><p>I arrived in Morocco when I was just 23. I was sent by the IPSEN Group to set up the business in Casablanca. The group had a clear focus on this region with an existing office in Tunisia and Algeria, and it wanted to open in Morocco. I started from scratch here with two people. In the beginning, we were extremely specialized in conventional sea freight and cargo, as well as project cargo. Over the years, we grew to 15 people, and now we have reached a setup of 120 people. We have developed many services, and much of that is in supply chain. We have our own logistics warehouse as well. Some 12 years ago, we shifted our focus to logistics with an investment of EUR10 million with a local bank partner. We are also a customs broker via our subsidiary IGT (Ipsen Group Transit) that was set up in 2003 to follow the growth of our customers and handle new high value industrial project.. Now, we are heavily involved in the entire supply chain; when a product is moving, we are involved. We transport either by sea, air, or truck. We have a trucking business that travels all around Europe. We have consolidation hubs in Europe for pickup, stuffing, and moving products around. We can move products from all over Europe with main hub in Gelsenkirchen, Stuttgart, Milan, Lyon, Paris, Madrid, Barcelona, or Marseilles on a weekly basis to Morocco. We also have our own bonded warehouse in Casablanca with a customs officer on site. The focus is on transporting, clearing, storing, and distribution. We have our own trucks for local distribution and logistics customers. When you talk about the supply chain, we are actually a one-stop shop solution.</p><h4>As of January 2020, the logistics sector represents 6% of the national economy. What has your strategy been since the COVID-19 outbreak?</h4><p>COVID-19 was completely unexpected, and we had to take some drastic measures to cope with it. You cannot stop the supply chain, logistics, or the transport of goods. We had to focus internally on all aspects such as sanitizers and masks. We also have a doctor on our staff who visits once a week. We made a mapping of all of our facilities and offices, and we trained our people so that they would respect social distancing and work with masks correctly, for example. In addition, 80% of our office staff have begun working from home. In the warehouse, things are more complicated, but we could not take any risks; we had 50% of the staff at home on a rotating three-shift basis. People do not come into contact with each other as much. If we discover a case, we can easily isolate the entire shift and bring another shift on. As far as business is concerned, international transport has dropped evenly. If you are not able to pick up cargo, you can't transport it, so we have seen a drop of about 35% in volume and activity. We also have a de facto drop in customs operations since all transport has a customs clearance file along with it. The positive sign is that logistics is still booming significantly; we are working heavily in logistics. We consider it a good thing that we have involved ourselves in all these different segments; when one drops, another climbs. The fact is our warehouses are full. It was a huge investment of EUR10 million, and we are still paying for that over 15 years, though we are certain it was the right decision to be made. This economic crisis pushes our innovation further. Very recently we developed a specific department dedicated to our e-commerce customers for the last mile delivery.</p><h4>How would you describe the digitalization of IPSEN and the sector in Morocco?</h4><p>IPSEN is extremely well digitalized in terms of its level of IT and computer usage. We have our own system for transporting, accounting, and customer service. All of these are linked to our server and the cloud, and we can all communicate easily with all our offices. With digitalization, some specific applications will come later on for some particular bases. We do not have any digital applications that all our employees use, though it is something we think about down the line. Morocco has been pushing hard for digitalization, especially from the customs authorities. Increasingly, we are sending package invoices and commercial documents into its online system. Even release orders, which are the titles of the properties of the cargo, are done digitally. It is available in the customs system, which we call PortNet. Morocco is a year ahead of what it expected with this digital advancement, and we attended weekly training sessions with the customs authorities to ensure a smooth adoption of the new technology. We are also a member of a circle of experts who diagnose and solve problems in the system. It is certainly improving significantly.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the logistics sector in Morocco compared to the rest of the region?</h4><p>One problem we are facing is the price of land and the cost of real estate. The Logistics Development Association of Morocco (AMDL) is currently in the process of identifying several zones with high priority and asking us if we are interested in some land there. AMDL is a major part of our focus in coming years, because it will be able to provide us land at an affordable cost and restructure logistics in Morocco by putting us in a dedicated zone. In Casablanca or Tangier for example, everyone has their warehouse, whether close to the city or far away in an industrial area, and for many years, there has been no focus on where we need to set up. Now, that is changing, which is a positive thing. It will mean that making an investment will be safe when you know you are in the right zone. The land will be affordable and we can focus on our business plan rather than scoping out expensive land in a zone we are not certain about. I am in close contact with the general manager of AMDL as well as all structured logistics operators, and we all give a lot of input to its strategy. It has open arms to everyone in logistics so that it can come up with the best solution for the next 10 years. The sector is definitely on track in this respect.</p><h4>What are your goals for the year ahead?</h4><p>In Morocco, there is a great deal of competition. There are perhaps 2,000 freight forwarding competitors in Casablanca alone. There are 800 competitors in customs clearance, 300 in logistics, and possibly 1,000 when it comes to local tracking and distribution. For many years, and still to date, the informal market is hurting us. It is working but does not pay any VAT, social security, or retirement plans. This is our first obstacle, which is extremely tricky, and we hope that in the coming years the authorities will focus on eradicating such activity. We cannot sell a container from Shanghai for USD2,000 when there is someone selling it for USD1,800 since they do not pay social security, and when they are caught, they closes down and open something new. Hopefully, the sector will be more formalized. We see it happening with the Association of Freight Forwarding of Morocco (AFFM). We have to focus on the fields where there is less competition and where we can provide the best added value for customers. We can figure out the best niche that will allow us to follow their growth. On a daily basis, we are investing in IT, maintenance, space, people, and everything else for our customers. This is the best focus for us for the next five years. We want to grow every day, increase our margins, buy better, get more trucks, and have a bigger space. The focus with AMDL is to sell our current warehouse so that we can build a bigger warehouse in a dedicated area. We will move from 20,000sqm to 50,000sqm, but it is a huge project that will cost a large sum of money and take a long time with banks. However, the bigger we are, the more we can reduce costs. The future of our scope is to be able to concentrate all our activities in the same area with customs process, logistics warehouse, bonded warehouse, free zone warehouse, distribution and dispatch center, etc,… that way, we can offer to the market all supply chain answers and mutualize the resources and costs to a high scale.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has GDI continued to diversify its portfolio? </h4><p>2019 was the year we decided to diversify both in terms of our typical business lines and countries. Before, we were known for pipeline construction and mining work, but now we have decided to diversify into the complete midstream segment, especially in storage terminal construction as EPC contractors. Now we design, procure, and construct projects for storage terminals. We finished the Veracruz hydrocarbons terminal, and we have decided to enter additional international markets. One market was Europe, and the other was Nicaragua in the mining division for a small quarry private client. In Europe, we looked at a 15 river crossings for a gas pipeline in Serbia, which required a lot more collaboration.</p><h4>What are your next steps when it comes to international expansion?</h4><p>We are evaluating Canada and Texas for oil and gas. In mining, 2020 will be a year of execution. Now that we are in Europe, we have to see if it is worth staying there. To be honest, we are forecasting that Saudi Aramco, thanks to its IPO, will require a lot of infrastructure, and Saudi Arabia is going to be the next place to look at for midstream projects. The world has become a globalized economy, even though people are closing doors. If you keep waiting for a country to give you work, there is no chance to grow. As Mexicans, we need to get rid of the mentality of waiting for work. We should try to export our talent and see what we can do somewhere else.</p><h4>Is expansion one of your main goals for 2020?</h4><p>For the moment, yes. We are building a storage terminal in Manzanillo for the private sector. The challenge is that it requires a lot of offshore work and a landfill connection between land and sea. The installation of the terminal, both connecting it and installing it, has become a huge challenge and it will make 2020 busy. It is a new challenge in Mexico to export or import hydrocarbons, and this kind of technical work must pay close attention to safety and environmental policy as well as quality. With that, there are specific alliances with other offshore companies currently working.</p><h4>What are the most important characteristics your are looking for when it comes to international partnerships?</h4><p>We are looking for a local partner who can help us grow fast and with whom we can complement the construction of pipelines or storage terminals. We have identified certain companies in Texas and Calgary. With that in mind, we are trying to see if there is a cultural match. When you arrive in another country, it is about matching the culture and wanting to get things done. As long as we find the right partner, we will be happy to continue working.</p><h4>How do you ensure success in GDI's international ventures?</h4><p>The mentality of staying in one's own country, seeing what happens, and growing with the country is not enough. If you want to grow and if you want to go far, the world is your oyster. It is the reality of globalization. The project in Europe is a small project around USD15 million. The one in Nicaragua is around USD28 million. However, these types of projects give us a chance to understand the country and how things work. Once we visualize the project, we can start thinking about how to mobilize resources. The first step is knowing how to collaborate far from home. For me, mobilization simply involves technical practices that need to be performed. Mexico is a huge country; going from the south of the country to north is like going from France to Portugal. We do not know yet if there is a market in Europe. The economy there has kind of stagnated like Mexico. Other countries like Saudi Arabia and Canada are growing, especially in gas, and I'm interested in this growth.</p><h4>What are the main areas of opportunities you have identified within the global energy transition? </h4><p>The world is going through an energy transition and the growth of gas is just a tiny variable. Now we are going through a generational change. MIT produced an interesting tool that allows you to understand that this energy transition is an 80-year process. Even with taxes on coal and oil and subsidized renewables in the simulation, this tool shows you that this is not enough to achieve the requirements of the Paris Agreement. As GDI, we want to follow the transition accordingly by focusing first on oil and gas and then transitioning to other infrastructure. Diversifying is about planting seed-by-seed and watching how they grow.</p><h4>Do you plan to diversify into renewable energy in the future?</h4><p>I would love to, but in the short term, it is not possible. Energy depends not just on what you want; it depends on the political context you are in. In the US, Mexico, and Canada, it is gas. The fact is, adaptability is the highest standard you can have in this dynamic world: Continue moving, think fast, and start thinking about whatever you are going to do next. We noticed that even though we are excellent at what we do, we needed to diversify toward other markets. We also need to look at different industries. We are thinking more strategically about what to do, what not to do, where to go, and where not to go. The world is going through a lot of compliance and digitalization. Everyone wants to know what you are doing, which has made things interesting.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main operations in Morocco?</h4><p>The energy transitions which rely on renewable energies and on energy efficiency demand long-term policies. The chance in Morocco is the Royal will and vision that is being implemented. A phenomenon that provides glimmers of hope is the cost of produced energies from renewable resources which continues its already dazzling decrease. Nowadays, the least expensive way of producing electricity is through photovoltaic power generation. Wind energy comes in second place. Some industrialists implemented energy efficiency measures while producing with renewable energies and that, successfully resulted in a drastic drop of their energy bill whilst reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. This applies for the industrialists, but is also becoming more and more attractive to households, cities, and rural communities. The evolution in energy storage, whose cost also decrease, shows that new environmental and economic solutions will be implemented to supply energy without any wasting while being consumed, especially on our continent where still 600 million inhabitants have no access to electricity. The case of the Kingdom of Morocco is interesting from this perspective: being the source of only 0,15% of the world emissions, the energy transition represents a political will to the highest level of the State, and did not emerge during the COP 22, but since 2009. Priority was given to renewable energies and to energy efficiency, through two dedicated agencies: the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency (AMEE) and the Moroccan Agency for Sustainable Energy (MASEN), in charge developing the largest projects around renewables. Both must go hand in hand. It is essential that, at the same time as renewable energy, a voluntarist policy in energy efficiency must be developed in all sectors: electricity production, industry, urban planning, construction, transport, agriculture… Energy efficiency establishes itself as a key lever,  by being the most effective strategic approach so that countries meet their commitments to reduce greenhouse gases at a fast speed and at a lower cost : let us recall that the least expensive energy is the one which is not consumed. This year, the industrial, agricultural and public construction sectors were the main targets of the Moroccan Agency for Energy Efficiency. We could go faster if the green financing was available, as even if renewable energies are easily financed today, energy efficiency requires however more financial support.</p><h4>If people install solar panels on roofs, can they sell electricity back to the grid?</h4><p>No, one can only produce electricity for personal use. Today, there are public projects for utilities, and MASEN is launching tenders and buying all the electricity produced from promoters. However, there is also a law allowing individuals to produce their own renewable energy and even sell it to another industry, though only on high tension. Low and mid tension is being debated. We have many completely private projects selling to other private companies in the steel, mining, and railway companies that are purchasing electricity from private wind projects. We are pushing for legislation on small projects and for public buildings at the highest level of the state. All public buildings such as AMEE should be an example by using a solar roof where possible and reducing their energy bills.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges to reach 15% energy efficiency by 2030?</h4><p>In some cases, it will be easy and in others it will be difficult. We are pushing to have national financial support for energy efficiency because we can help all farmers be more efficient. In industry, we also need more financing, though it is great that local banks have loans dedicated to energy efficiency. We also need water treatment station for residential uses and biogas as energy, with the water being used for irrigation. There is a nexus between water, electricity, and energy. That is there is a program for all 12 regions in the country that we are discussing with mayors to have this energy efficiency reflected. They receive projects from hotels, industry, hospitals, and so on. We can help check if the projects have an energy-efficient approach.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your energy-efficiency workshops in rural areas and how this will be implemented nationally?</h4><p>Heightening awareness and capacity building are keys. We are rising awareness of farmers in all the regions. We train young people how to size, install and maintain solar pumps. We have a training center in Marrakesh called Green Platform which help capacity building in different sectors linked to energy efficiency for Morocco and for all Africa. AMEE has 20 agreements with different agencies in the continent. The approach is to have young people who are locally trained doing the right job for installation and maintenance of thousands of small projects. This is how we can create jobs by providing the energy service to millions of people.</p><h4>What are you focusing on in 2020?</h4><p>We want to help all five sectors to decrease their energy bill. For some we have to push, as it is clear it is economically viable. Agriculture for example is crucial. Also, in the building sector we are pushing for regulation to be applied in all regions. We will also monitor energy efficiency, and by law, we will now follow the consumption of all big consumers in Industry. We have a program to monitor and label all imports and to establish minimum energy performance standards. When one is importing fridges or air conditioning, they will need to have energy efficiency labels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the university adapt to the current situation of COVID-19 not only for its students but also society?</h4><p>During this international crisis, our country had quickly taken, under the direct supervision and leadership of His Majesty the King, strong and proactive actions to manage this unprecedented crisis. It is in times like these that we recognize structured states and the efficiency of their institutions. During this crisis, our university has taken various measures and actions for its students and for society. First, we implemented close to 100% distance learning for all our programmes (in education we rather use program and not program). To ensure equity and equal opportunities for all, we provided, with help from the EU, new computers and 4G internet sticks with one-year subscription to 530 students from rural areas and from low-income families to allow them to be connected and to have access to distance learning as the other students.  We also took action to take care of our foreign students who unfortunately could not return to their home countries and are currently living in our university dormitories. We sterilize the dormitories and hand out masks and hand sanitizer gels regularly, and we give them packed lunches, drinks and other items. We also provide them with psychological assistance, when needed. For society, staff at our university have voluntarily donated part of or their entire one-month salary to the national fund for the management of COVID-19. Second, we have produced thousands of protective visors and donated them to hospitals and administrations in our region. We have also developed and fabricated washable, sterilizable, and reusable plastic masks with homemade filters that comply with international medical requirements. The masks are manufactured in our university with 3D printing facilities. We have developed a new respirator-valve and a new air-flow meter in our university in collaboration with doctors from Rabat that is currently being tested in hospitals. We have also developed an application for the virus tracking that will be put at the disposal of the authorities. Our university has been extremely active during this period of containment and confinement. We do not communicate a lot about our actions in this period of crisis, but we are doing our best to take care of our staff and our students and we are strongly committed in technological projects that are of help to the society.</p><h4>UEMF has a wide portfolio of studies, such as social sciences, political sciences, business school, architecture, and engineering, among others. Which of these see greater demand?</h4><p>In September 2019, we opened a new engineering school, which is first of its kind in Europe and in Africa region: a 5-year engineering school completely dedicated to Artificial Intelligence (AI). There are some schools in North America and Asia but none yet in Europe or Africa. We have concluded several agreements with various universities from the two shores of the Mediterranean, with generally double diplomas for students. Presently, we have nine entities, three faculties, three engineering schools (Mechanical engineering, civil engineering, IT engineering, biomedical engineering and AI engineering), a school of architecture, a school of business, and an institute of law and political sciences. In September, we will open a faculty of pharmacy. UEMF offers world-class bachelors, master's, and PhD programs, both in research and education, in humanities and social sciences, life sciences, engineering, business, and architecture.</p><h4>UEF is part of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM), which brings together all EU member countries and 15 countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean. What are the main goals and initiatives of this organization?</h4><p>UfM was extremely instrumental in the creation of the university. It also played a crucial role from political standpoint and helped to complete the budget of the University. A large part of our budget comes from the Moroccan state and the rest from UE and from the European Bank of Investment (EIB) in form of loan.  I take this opportunity to express our high appreciation and our gratitude to the Moroccan Government, to the EU end the EIB. </p><h4>UEMF has several partnerships with foreign universities such the Sorbonne in Paris or the University of Florence. What is your strategy in this regard?</h4><p>The strategy of the university is to act as a platform that bridges, from educational and cultural viewpoint, the two reams of the Mediterranean. We have strong collaboration and partnerships with several universities and research institutions from Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, Belgium, Sweden, UK, Germany, Greece, Slovenia, Canada, US, China, Tunisia and other countries, including from sub-Saharan Africa. Presently, students and faculty members of our university represent 32 nationalities, both from north and from south. They work together in harmony, they imagine and they innovate in a collaborative way. UEMF is a true multicultural and multidimensional environment with a Euro-Mediterranean-African identity. We also have collaborations with other regions of the world beyond Europe. For example, this summer we were expecting to receive some students from Stanford University (USA), but unfortunately this had been postponed due to COVID-19. We also have collaborations with China, Canada and Chile. We are currently preparing for international accreditations with the assistance of UfM.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your eco-campus?</h4><p>From the beginning, the campus sought to be an eco-campus that got the labeling from COP22 that was organized in Marrakech in 2016. We have in fact included several technologies of sustainable development, with the objective to be energy sufficient, to consume a minimum of water and to take maximum benefit from natural sunlight. The used technologies include highly insulating materials, photovoltaic, and thermal solar devices, recycling of gray water, rainwater harvesting and its reuse for watering gardens. The design of the buildings was inspired by the ancestral know-how of the city of fez in terms of ventilation and natural air conditioning. Our students from architecture and from the Master's on Renewable energy program conducted several projects about sustainable development on the campus.</p><h4>How would you rate the Moroccan educational sector compared to the region?</h4><p>In the last five years, we have witnessed an important expansion in the higher education system, with a wide choice of universities including public universities, not-for-profit universities that are endowed with public utility status like our university, and purely private universities. The number of students has also tripled, with more than 1.2 million students currently. This brings various challenges, such as dealing with this significant expansion by operating a true digital transition in our universities. Second, we have to design career-oriented programs that are closely linked to economic strategic sectors in the country. More than that, we must design proactive programs to shape a generation of entrepreneurs who can create innovative start-ups and their own businesses to generate wealth and participate to Morocco's economic and technological development. It is also of high importance to revise the 01-00 law governing the higher education in Morocco and have more operational governing bodies of the university and render the higher education system more flexible and agile to respond to the society needs and challenges. The new law should include, among others, the autonomy of the universities and the status of the not-for-profit universities that should be distinguished from the purely private universities. To comply with international standards, the Moroccan universities should also be open to the diaspora and to foreigner talents by recognizing their achievements in foreigner countries and include them within the national system. Finally, a true assurance quality system should be implement in universities with a top-down and bottom-up assessment and evaluation including the evaluation of the faculty members, the chairs of departments, the deans and even the rectorate team. Such performance-oriented strategy should concern also universities with a contract between the Ministry of Higher Education based on clear deliverables. Such assurance quality system should be accompanied by a posteriori control of the achievements and the of the financing of the universities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main reasons behind Dow's success in Mexico?</h4><p>Our 60 years story in the country has been founded in transforming ourselves, because the markets are never stagnant. At Dow, the continuing changes in infrastructure, automotive, construction, packaging, and major sustainability challenges are great opportunities. We trust that our expertise will put us at the forefront of these issues. We are ready for the following challenges that will arise from in the future. We are extremely optimistic that we will continue growing. Also the market is currently characterized by the growth of the middle class, and in effect its increased consumption. Based on this automotive industry, and the manufacturing industry, including oil and gas, have also been the great pillars of Mexico during this period. Dow's current portfolio is aligned with those pillars. The Mexican consumer needs Dow's value chains. Another reason behind Dow's success in Mexico has been the investment in technology and manufacturing. The great investments that Dow did especially in North America have been an important catalyst for us. It has made high-quality products available for the Mexican market. Investments were done, especially in the area of Texas and Louisiana, but also in our Querétaro, Tlaxcala, and Toluca plants. Our local manufacturing network and the one with the US allow us to be extremely competitive to meet these needs. This is why, 25-30% of our business in Latin America is in Mexico. Our relevance in Latin America and globally is evident, for example, we have Research and Development laboratories in Mexico, and it is not just about importing technology from other places and position them locally but also seeing what the Mexican market needs and can provide.. As another example, we have several members of our team in Toluca that have created a patent developed in Mexico that we are marketing today in the world. We actually bring in our global capabilities in order to create things in Mexico.</p><h4>What sectors are you prioritizing in terms of investment in Mexico next year?</h4><p>Our presence is diversified, but the first area is related to the consumer sector, which includes our portfolios of packaging, personal care, technology, etc. Almost everything you use at home. Consumer trends go extremely well with the technologies we offer in our portfolio, for example, specialized plastics for packaging that could help us to address food waste, polyurethanes for a more comfortable mattress, or products for sustainable paints. We are in 96% of value chains in Mexico according to our analysis. This can give you a picture of our relevance in almost every market. Besides that, development of technology is necessary for our manufacturing processes. We can proudly say that we had jumped into Manufacturing 4.0. That's why we had implemented state-of-the-art technology in our sites, such as our innovative Mobile Worker project in Querétaro. Which brings the expertise of our people, by taking advantage of newest systems and processes. This is not only for our benefit, but for our customers. We are really optimistic, that's why we had been in Mexico for more than six decades. Regardless of GDP reports, our mentality is to always have a growth plan.</p><h4>What was the objective behind being the first to improve a road with recycled plastics?</h4><p>Circular Economy is one of our strategic Sustainability Goals and plastic is one of the noblest materials that can have more than one useful life. For two or three years, there has been a lot of news and actions about plastic waste. Based on this, we are working to provide clear information on plastics, its impact and the huge benefit that a correct waste disposal can bring.  We are also designing products that are designed to be recycled since its production, also we will also continue working on packages that use less material, because we have to maintain the balance in the rational use of plastic. And last but not least, we are also developing strong projects that can assure a social impact aligned with the Circular Economy piece. The road is a part of this idea. There are over 400,000 km of unpaved roads in Mexico. There is also the problem of what to do with plastic waste. That's why along with other allies, we managed to create an asphalt road improved with recycled plastic that can increase its durability, and it is competitive in costs for the public and private sector. It is a win-win where the plastic waste is reincorporated in a high-value application. That ecosystem is a winning formula.</p><h4>What are your priorities as president of ANIQ?</h4><p>There are two big priorities. The first on is the Circular Economy, with which our industry was one of the first to adopt its principles. On this, we are working with the public policy authorities to seek for alternatives in which the industry, our customers and the consumer feel comfortable with a clear focus on sustainability. That's why we are working to help on rational, data-based public policies. The technology exists, but we need the rest of the value chain to have waste collection, segregation systems, have collection centers, and so on because otherwise there is no matter. We are working together. Public policies must be adequate for all of us to do our job. The second priority is keep growing our capacity and keep gaining relevance as a key industry. Around the 1970s and 1980s, our industry experienced a Golden Age, when PEMEX was a stronger player, we had more integrated chains, and so on; even though, the interesting thing is that in the past six years, our industry in Mexico had more than USD18 billion invested to productive assets. It has been a 5-6% growth per year of continuous demand for the industry; however, the access to raw material and energy has been a challenge. In 2018, the Mexican chemical industry accounted for 2.1% of GDP. Currently, many things have to be imported, or the supplies have to be shipped at great distances before they are delivered to the consumer. We need to keep working to assure the availability of gas and raw materials. The petrochemical industry must be strengthened. It is good for the whole country in any dimension that is seen. There are no advanced economies without strong chemical industries. We have to be specific in the steps to reactivate the availability of materials in Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will the new labor reform law impact Mexican companies? </h4><p>The new reforms are actually taking us backwards. In the past, we didn't see as many human rights negotiations in areas such as gender equality and discrimination. Prior to the reforms in May 2019, you couldn't file a claim or a suit for sexual harassment in the labor environment but now you can, and that is the only advantage of the new reform in my opinion. In 2012, there were other reforms that made the working system between employees and employers fairer. The new reforms are similar to the labor laws that were introduced in 1931. Such laws allow social rights groups to put all the blame on the employer. In the past, employers had the ability to persuade employees to buy clothing and food from their own stores, for example. Nowadays, with all the technology, communications, and new systems we have, it is not necessary to make employers prove everything. There is also a new accessory law that claims that all unions have to activate or legitimize themselves. Employees have to vote for the union they want. After that, they have to ratify their vote one by one. After a collective negotiation, or once a deal is made, employees can veto it.</p><h4>How would you compare the performance of the law firm in 2019 to 2018?</h4><p>Our performance in 2019 was quite similar to 2018, but it was impacted by a general slowdown of the Mexican economy. We got a lot of new clients and retained all of our old clients, but the economy stayed flat. As a result, clients started to delay payments. We have a presence in all sectors, from mining to transportation, industry, and pharmaceuticals. We are also in technology and services. In 2019, we saw a lot of collective agreements and strikes, as well as individual litigations.</p><h4>What is the main added value that Maillard offers?</h4><p>One advantage that we offer is our specialization. We don't hire lawyers from other law firms. We only hire new lawyers and train them in line with our values, goals, and vision. If you compare us to the rest of the industry, we're one of the law firms with the lowest employee turnover at just 18%. The other added value is our technology. One of the services we offer that no other law firm in Mexico offers is that all of our clients' trials are on the cloud. No other labor legal law firm has the technology we have. Clients don't need to call use every month to learn what is happening with their case; they can access that information anytime with the click of a button. This means our clients can access their trials on the cloud. We are developing an app that will allow them to scan a QR code for immediate access. We also have a new agreement with a company to develop an AI system that will specialize exclusively in Mexican labor law. We see this as the future.</p><h4>What do you think of the conditions of the new NAFTA agreement?</h4><p>They are clearly aggressive toward Mexico. By forcing some companies to move back to the US, which is something the democratic party in particular is pushing for, more jobs will be created in the US as opposed to Mexico. This would hurt the industry in Mexico. We have to be positive, competitive, and continue working hard to make sure we keep growing and not be afraid of the government's policies. They want to take manufacturing back to the US, especially manufacturing of cars and auto parts, as well as steel and metallurgy. We can help these companies by negotiating with chambers of commerce so that new reforms that would hurt these companies do not pass. If you are a new company and you want to be an entrepreneur in Mexico, you need to pay nearly 70% in taxes. If there are no new companies, the competition will die out. It's hurting the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide a general overview of the aerospace sector of Morocco, which has grown exponentially in the last 10 years?</h4><p>2020 represents the 20th anniversary of the emergence of the aerospace industry cluster in Morocco. Today, there are 140 companies, and the 2020 objective is 20,000 jobs, USD2 billion of export turnover, 40% of local added value, and 40% of women in our teams. We have had a growth rate of 17-18% on average in the last five to six years. Today, the Moroccan aerospace base is recognized as the most competitive base at the door of Europe, the second-largest aerospace market in the world. Morocco has attracted major players such as Boeing, Safran, Bombardier - Spirit (which acquired Bombardier), Stellia (Airbus subsidiary), Thales and Hexcel in the composite technologies, as well as many SMEs such as Tecalemit, GOAM, TDM aerospace and others. Today, we are moving on to Phase II of aeronautics that we are calling Aerospace 2.0. This phase is characterized by attracting new Ecosystems even more complicated such as the engine, composite materials, embedded electronics, 3D printing, fiber optics, and others. Phase II is about going faster, further and higher. The first one, faster, is about attracting new companies. In the beginning, we attracted many French companies, and today we are attracting American, Canadian, and even Japanese companies, in MIDPARC, the Moroccan Aerospace Cluster Casablanca Going further is about attracting companies beyond the field of aeronautics, namely defense, on-board, electronics, energy, composite materials, medical, and engineering… because these are aeronautic sisters industries. Going higher implies more added value, namely overcoming or “escaping the trap“ of low-cost production and becoming a hub for technological research. 20 years ago, we started with a workforce asset; today, Phase II is intelligence, technological research, and engineering. If we want to boost our aeronautics, automobile, and electronics industries and make these sectors more robust over time and we must increase the local add value and attract technological research. Otherwise, in the coming years AI will destroy some of the jobs, and other more competitive countries will also pull in other industries from Morocco. To me, now in Morocco we have gone beyond the concept of manpower is, it is force power, and force power includes not only the cost of labor but also talents, added value dedicated people, flexibility... if today there is an aerospace industry in Morocco, it is because we have nearly 20,000 young people who are highly dedicated to their jobs.</p><h4>What will make Morocco preferable to other countries then?</h4><p>What makes Morocco different is its capacity to provide talents and solutions for SMEs, as they have technology and markets, but they need to be more competitive. How can they be competitive? There are two solutions: innovation and talents. Here, they can find the talents they need, which is why we built the Moroccan Aerospace Institute (IMA) Casablanca, with the high value aerospace cluster just across the road. We work with universities to provide training for the engineers needed for the aeronautical professions.</p><h4>Does the public sector offer the specific training needed in the field?</h4><p>This is one of my day-to-day concerns: creating more links with universities to be able to provide the talents that we need, namely young people with engineering education, the ability to use simulation systems, can speak English, and have the right skills. For our Aerospace Phase II, we will focus more on talents and highly skilled persons. When we talk about aerospace today, we are talking about a number of sectors, namely assembly ecosystems; for example, everything from aircraft and engine maintenance to electrical and engineering. However, we are in the process of adding other bricks to aerospace, such as engines, on-board electronics, composites, and manufacturing. Through the IMA, we train our engineers and give them the skills and the values. It is important that we teach all these young people an ethical sense and integrity, how to innovate, quality, responsibility, professionalism, delivery on time, customer orientation, and education.</p><h4>How did Morocco become the most competitive base for Europe?</h4><p>There are three major markets for aerospace in the world: the US, Europe, and China. To penetrate the US with competitive costs, one needs to have a part of their business located in Mexico, because the costs in Mexico are a third of the costs in the US. For Europe, it used to be Eastern Europe or Ireland, but in the last years Eastern Europe joined EU and prices increased, for the benefit of Morocco. Close to Europe, there is no more competitive region than Morocco; Turkey is 35% more expensive, while Tunisia is really small and does not have a large base . That is why in September 2017 Boeing signed an agreement for USD1 billion per year to outsource from Morocco to draw 120 companies and employ 8,700 people. The last two reasons for our success are because we have a dedicated cluster here, Midparc, and because we established IMA to supply talents.</p><h4>What role has GIMAS played in the development of aeronautics in Morocco?</h4><p>GIMAS represents the industry, the valued partner of the state to promote Morocco as aerospace industry base. We set up a join marketing and communications plans for international airshows and BtoB meetings, we receive yearly at least 40 missions from companies who come to Morocco to visit, and when they see what we do, it encourages them to invest here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the greatest accomplishment of Victaulic in Mexico in 2019?</h4><p>It is a complicated question because the Mexican economy saw little growth in 2019. One of our greatest accomplishments this past year was to consolidate our presence in the markets we work operate in. There is general concern because the amount of business has fallen in all sectors, especially in energy generation and oil, gas &amp; chemical; however, in turn, this has helped boost demand for solutions that have added value. We can present our solutions as higher quality, less risk, and with more added value than competitive pipe joining methods. Now, we are focused on working with the new refinery to present alternative pipe joining solutions aimed at improving installation efficiency and safety.</p><h4>Considering the volatility of the industry, what strategies are you using to mitigate those risks?</h4><p>Our main goal is to transform systems that use old pipe joining and fluid control technologies toward new and innovative technology. To modernize and add value in installation, security, and efficiency. We are being more aggressive, taking more risks, and are providing extended warranties up to 30 years for new constructions. We are being aggressive because we trust our solutions, despite the fact that many sectors still see the initial cost as prohibitive. We will be working more on market penetration in 2020.</p><h4>What are the most important products you offer?</h4><p>We offer a hybrid fire extinguishing system, Victaulic Vortex, that uses hybrid technology to extinguish fires in special applications utilizing, nitrogen and a small volume of water as the extinguishing agents. It is an extremely versatile and 100 percent green technology since it does not use exotic or toxic chemicals to extinguish fires. Victaulic Vortex is used in control rooms, archives, data centers, museums and machine rooms. It has significant advantages over traditional water based fire sprinklers systems, CO2, and fire suppression systems based on more exotic chemicals. We can now be used on smaller diameter pipes where their traditional installation via threading was extremely dirty and labor intensive, and that is changing the fire protection industry. We have a wide range of pipe joints for fire protection piping systems that offer fast installation and a union at every joint which significantly increases efficiency during the initial pipe installation and during maintenance.</p><h4>Is there a particular sector that you have identified to diversify your current portfolio?</h4><p>We have always targeted all sectors, for example industrial, oil &amp; gas and fire protection, since our pipe joining and flow control solutions can be utilized on a wide range of piping application. If there is a construction project that requires fire protection or piping and valving for fluid transmission, we are there. Right now, we are being more aggressive in pursuing projects that we may have missed in the past. We are trying to communicate better among divisions within the company, so that we have information on time and can therefore participate with our solutions such as in projects for medium-sized malls, hotels, and food storage facilities. Last year (2019) was the first year where we did not experience growth in the past 15 years. We foresee the six-year period of the current government to be a period of slowed growth.</p><h4>Do you plan to launch new products in Mexico?</h4><p>We are focused on innovation, and a large percentage of our investments goes toward that goal. We are always developing new products; that is the heart of Victaulic. We are also looking into new technologies for pipe insulation, automated pipe preparation tools,  and joining solutions for plastic piping.</p><h4>What is needed the most in Mexico to renovate processes in the energy sectors?</h4><p>We need new plants, such as the refineries. Also, Mexico must invest in new power plants, including alternative energy sources such as solar and hydroelectric, and we provide a range of value added solutions for all sectors. When reviewing a project,  we sit down with our partners so they can understand that their total installed cost will be lower by using Victaulic solutions, even though the initial cost is higher when compared to traditional pipe joining methods. Victaulic solutions help reduce risks  and increases efficiency during piping system installations.  We are willing to work with them to show them the numbers and programs. There can be a reduction of costs of around 5-10%. We use work with engineering to use 3D modeling of the piping system design to increase the construction efficiency and reduce waste.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Karpowership's operations, and what measures have you taken to ensure safety onboard your vessels?</h4><p>Karpowership needs to maintain 100% reliability and availability to our customers because the electricity generated on our ships represents the baseload electricity capacity in our markets. Thus, we took several measures to ensure reliability and availability as the pandemic persists. The normal rotational period for employees on a Karpowership vessel is from one to three months. Thus, the moment we heard about the global spread of COVID-19, we relocated our teams that were well-rested to ships so that we could complete the rotation before the virus spread too far. These new and rested teams would not be rotated for the next three months. That was our first action. The second action we took was to completely stop the ins and outs from the ships. We were able to do that because our ships are fully contained living facilities. There are entertainment facilities on our ships such as Playstations or basketball courts, and they have full accommodation, showers, water treatment, on-board cooks, high-speed internet, and everything else to make them comfortable. For any very crucial activity that needed someone to board or disembark, we would first take their temperature, do a COVID-19 test, and then accept them onboard.</p><h4>How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted demand for Karpowership's power generation capabilities?</h4><p>I can approach this from three different angles—the sharp fall in tourism, lower fuel prices, and access to electricity. In saturated markets where electricity supply already meets full demand, the impact of a drop in tourism naturally lowered demand. However, where we see lower energy prices for natural gas or fuel, it has made it cheaper to buy electricity from the powerships, which has had the reverse impact on demand for electricity from our ships. This is the story for countries that have tourism as the major source of revenue, such as Cuba and Lebanon. For the less-touristy countries where we operate, such as Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and Gambia, we cannot actually meet the full demand with our current supply anyway. So when demand dropped, the supply was already here. Overall, none of our ships have reduced capacity. Customers are consuming 100% of whatever we can provide, even if their contract capacity is less than that of our ship. They want to benefit from this low-cost fuel environment, which may be short-lived.</p><h4>Karpowership has its largest presence in the African market. What are your ambitions for the African continent as it develops both its indigenous energy supply and greater traditional electricity generation capacity?</h4><p>Our vision is to use their indigenous natural resources. For example, we want to be able to use Sengalese gas in Senegal, Mauritanian gas in Mauritania, Mozambican gas in Mozambique, and so on. Until then, we want to provide the cheapest electricity possible. Those indigenous gas exploration projects may say they'll be operable in two to three years, in African conditions that could mean five to six years, if not more. You cannot leave a nation starved for power for that long and not expect it to have a major opportunity cost of growth. In order to be able to bridge from today until then, we want to be able to supply electricity for example via LNG, which is more environmentally friendly and cheaper. However, the future of Africa lies in natural gas.</p><h4>What market characteristics are most suitable for Karpowership?</h4><p>Almost all markets in Africa make perfect sense for different reasons. Many countries in Latin America and Asia are also suitable for us. A number of different market conditions can result in a need for solutions such as ours. For example, if a country has hydro capabilities, the major differences in many African countries between dry and wet seasons results in a need for backup generation for dry seasons. If they do not have hydro capabilities, they still may need baseload electricity because renewables currently do not generate enough electricity to be baseloads. Once battery solutions become efficient and feasible enough, they can be coupled with renewables and act as the baseload power source. Until that time, space- and cost-efficient baseload generation is key. With such a self-contained space, we are able to generate the full capacity required for a county. It is often easier to build a 500-MW powership in Yalova, Istanbul, in a shipyard versus building a traditional power plant in Africa with limited access to infrastructure such as roads, permits, logistics, transportation, and customers.</p><h4>What techniques do your ships employ to keep electricity affordable?</h4><p>There are two main thermal power technologies: turbines and engines. Our ships use engines that are interchangeable between gas and fuel oil, which allows us to use the cheaper alternative, based on price and availability in a given market. Turbines and engines have distinct characteristics that make them suitable for different markets. Turbines work well with extremely stable grids with no load fluctuations or supply interruptions. Engines, on the other hand, are far more durable and are not affected by load curves, frequency fluctuations, or hot temperatures. Africa needs engines, but unfortunately the lack of information about this means it has been spoon-fed turbines instead of engines for decades and decades. Our engine technology—which is hardly novel—still has the highest efficiency in the market and is the right solution for Africa. That is why we can make it so affordable.</p><h4>Can you give an overview of the vessel classes you are building in Istanbul now and the generation techniques you will employing?</h4><p>When we first started our powership fleet, we only had one class—which designates size and generation capacity—of ship. That was between 100-200MW. As we have expanded operations, there are many countries in Africa whose complete country-wide generation is just 40MW. In order to be able to provide a solution for them, we introduced a smaller-sized ship called the Seal class. There are also countries with shallow draft requirements that cannot accommodate a ship with a depth of 6m. We made a mid-sized class called the Mermaid class that has a 3-m draft and 80MW capacity. Some countries in Southeast Asia, however, like Indonesia, require 500MW. Ghana is the same, with a huge industrial economy that needs bulk power injection from one location. Thus, we build a vessel with the capacity to generate nearly 500MW, so we created the Khan class, which is now the largest vessel of its type in the world. The 20 vessels we have in the pipeline are from all of those classes.</p><h4>What main challenges will you face in the coming year, and what are your primary objectives?</h4><p>We have a strong balance sheet as a company, though third-party risks represent a challenge for us, especially considering the global economic troubles ahead. There may be suppliers with financial trouble or customers with currency problems. Our most important objective is to keep our employees safe. If we can achieve that, it will make it easier to maintain full reliability and availability for our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the company's key achievement in 2019?</h4><p>One key achievement was maintaining customer satisfaction throughout a challenging year. We sell measurement instruments, and our products are CAPEX investments, whereby the decision to acquire them involves an internal decision process. Therefore, 2019 was a year for consolidating our relationship with customers. We also seized this opportunity to train our personnel and team and be close to clients. We closed a project with a company in Guadalajara that manufactures lockers for residential homes. Its products are sold in Home Depot and other similar stores. We had another project in Obregon with Radial, a tier-2 client in the automotive industry, a sector in which our technology is in high demand. We also signed a deal with a supplier of General Motors for hardware screws.</p><h4>What is your key target sector?</h4><p>Automotive is a key sector, which accounts for 70% of our operations. Nearly 20% is aeronautical, while the remaining 10% is spread across a number of sectors including electronics and even the jewelry industry. In fact, we are in talks with the Chamber of Jewelers to become suppliers for the central laboratory and see notable growth opportunity in the sector. In Thailand, for example, Fischer is a supplier for Swarovski for the measurement of hardness of diamonds.</p><h4>How are you diversifying your products in Mexico?</h4><p> We are keen to increase automation in step with Industry 4.0. We have held talks with Metalsa, for example, and this could be a driver for 2020.</p><h4>Do you hold quality certification?</h4><p>We are audited by SQS in Switzerland, including our ISO 9001:2015 certification. In Mexico, we hold the PJLA ISO/IEC 17025 certification, which pertains to those firms that manufacture measurement equipment as well as their calibration traceability.</p><h4>What added value do you represent?</h4><p>Our products are ready for use. We have updated them for connection to robotics and other automation devices. The headquarters in Germany already has certain tailor-made products geared toward the manufacturers of semiconductors. Meanwhile, in Mexico we are mostly focused on industrial applications. We do not have an inhouse engineering division in the local market and need to establish partnerships with companies that integrate these products, say, in the automotive industry.</p><h4>What strategies do you plan to implement to further showcase your company?</h4><p>We are aware of the need for visibility on the media most consumed in the current era. We need to get clients talking about the benefits our technology. For example, we intend to showcase one case study of our work per month over a three-month period.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We want to surpass our sales revenue of 2017, our record year that built on the numerous campaigns we realized in 2015 and 2016 to promote our technology. It was the perfect storm, because as we started to present and establish the brand, many companies were simultaneously making the move toward these new technologies. We could also potentially enter the mining sector this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Our commitment toward developing and shaping the nation's talent implies that education should be accessible to all. Our programme of support for people of determination maximises inclusion in mainstream classes, with additional staff to facilitate personalised programmes of learning. We take a holistic view and maintain high expectations of social, emotional, behavioural, and academic progress for our people of determination. Aldar Education endorses an inclusive, sustainable education model that inspires changes in knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes to enable a more sustainable and just society for our students and our communities. These initiatives, along with many others, have placed us at the forefront of shaping the nation's pipeline of talent. Within the capital's educational ecosystem, we lead by offering community-based learning experiences and for this very reason we have instigated various sector partnerships to inculcate and demonstrate environment-friendly practices among our students. The core element of our success is in creating an atmosphere of partnerships with all academic staff and parents. By encouraging participation from teachers and parents at every level, we are able to create an engaged community based on trust and a passion to improve the lives of our future generations.</p><p><strong>What is Aldar Education's view on integrating continuously changing technologies into the classroom experience?<br></strong>Innovative classroom experiences are crucial, particularly as we prepare our students for higher education and employment in the future. For this very reason, we are investing significantly in technology and innovation. Introducing the latest and most advanced technologies across all schools as part of a drive to empower staff, students, and wider school communities with essential 21st-century skills. We remain a leading force within the UAE in incorporating technology within our facilities. Equipped with the latest technology in our classrooms such as AI-powered learning software, our teachers are able to customise the learning journey, depending on his/her needs and, therefore, we facilitate a more impactful and engaging learning environment. All our schools are accredited as Microsoft Showcase Schools, which helps us focus our delivery on learning and leading. We are planning to introduce world-recognized technology qualifications from Microsoft that students can enrol in whilst still in school. Through visual gaming tools, such as Minecraft Education, we are able to make teaching more focused and effective while engaging the minds of our students. Our recently launched LEGO® Education Innovation Studio offers a hands-on learning approach that actively involves students in their own learning process. By facilitating an innovative education experience and a comfortable learning environment, our students are able to take their learning a step forward and develop skills that will transform them into global citizens of the future.</p><p><strong>How does Aldar Education work with the government to help advance education in the UAE?<br></strong>At Aldar Education, we always strive to provide a holistic learning experience. With the support of a robust and dedicated team of education experts, we are working on strengthening Aldar Education's partnership portfolio with multiple government and non-government entities to collaborate on initiatives that will benefit our students and communities. Our strategic partnership formed with the Abu Dhabi Department of Education and Knowledge (ADEK) is part of a joint initiative to provide a world-class education system. As a result of the partnership, we have implemented an expansion action plan including the inauguration, management and operation of Al Rayana School, a pilot for the Abu Dhabi's Charter Schools programme, the very first of its kind to be introduced in the region. Through implementation of this system, we have witnessed a real difference in the learning experiences of our students with some of them surpassing national average scores, which is a momentous achievement given that this program is still in its infancy. Another testimonial of our commitment towards the community is our recent pledge to commit over 25,000 visits by our students to the Expo 2020 taking place in Dubai. We were among the select few to sign this commitment and extend our student's learning environment beyond classrooms. Through these initiatives and many others, we are working closely with the Abu Dhabi and Dubai government to provide high-quality education with international standards, and a focus on Arabic, Islamic Studies and local culture. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the ADSG's mandate?<br></strong>ADSG is focused on up-skilling government employees across many different sectors. Abu Dhabi's government recognizes the need for consistency in skills, competencies, and frameworks. ADSG provides a platform for cross-entity communication and collaboration; this allows for that consistency while also recognizing the importance of engaging the learner. By focusing on the needs of both the government and the individual, we aim to ensure that future challenges are appropriately met. The shelf life of a skill set in the past used to be around eight years, while today it is just 18 months. What's more, the government is disproportionately impacted by the rapid rate of change in technology in all sectors as it must monitor, regulate, incubate, and encourage economic diversivication of the private sector. We attempt to improve the skills of government employees to understand, analyze, implement, and evaluate information related to their respective industries.</p><p><strong>What criteria do you use to identify common skills gaps across the diverse spectrum of government services?<br></strong>ADSG actively engages with government departments. We talk to managers and students to establish what the expectations are across the varied disciplines. We find many commonalities and can create consistent models. Part of what we are building is future skills. This involves monitoring global trends and seeing where industries are going. Recently, we partnered with Coursera, which provides online education and 3,400 different courses that we can link to our competency model. Additionally, we are also building communities of practice. For example, we are launching our HR communities of practice. This allows workers in a sub-specialty to be certified within a particular skill set, as well as having a forum to exchange information. These specialists recognize the major trends across their respected industries. In turn, this gives us access to identify the silos and learning gaps based on experiences.</p><p><strong>What are some of the fundamental and transferable skills that are being taught at ADSG?<br></strong>Career resilience is vital for all employees. For example, in the US, people expect to have a lifelong career path. This may not be the best for the individual, the economy, or the government they serve. As the economy shifts, demand evolves into new areas. The best way for people to serve their country is personal development. No one knows where they will be needed in five years; however, if they have a basic set of transferable skills, they will be prepared. The most important thing anyone can do right now is to develop a culture within the government, and an ethos for themselves that fosters continuous learning and knowledge seeking.</p><p><strong>What are some of the ways that you have engaged with international stakeholders to build the learning infrastructure of ADSG?<br></strong>Part of our mandate is to engage with and support the existing market infrastructure. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel, nor are we a commercial enterprise. Our approach is based on the concept of dynamic learning. By remaining close to the learning industry we are able to engage with the most current, relevant, interesting, and impactful developments while remaining outside the rigidity of traditional academic infrastructure. We can focus on application and impact of learning, research, and skills. </p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the next five years?<br></strong>For us to consider ourselves successful, we want the government to create a curious and knowledge-seeking group of employees. People in the education system often lose their curiosity and innovation. When they enter the workforce, they are told to think outside the box but their entire paradigm and mental models contradict that. Given the rapid rate of change we do not even know what we need to be teaching five years from now. Our aim is to equip employees with the means to think how to best serve their country, families, and themselves. Data is important, but data is much easier to get than ever before. Interpretation and analysis of that data is the currency of the future. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the industry-specific education available in the Emirate?<br></strong>We need to bring general education to this industry, and the UAE has done a brilliant job in this respect. Film education in the UAE is growing, but, personally, I am an advocate for local talent attending the best international film schools and then bringing that world-class education back. Rather than reinventing the wheel by building new schools here, we should invest that same money and resource into other areas of the local industry's infrastructure. What the UAE needs is ongoing, practical training for professionals. Part of Image Nation's commitment to nurturing and developing future industry leaders has led to Arab Film Studio, our flagship training program. It offers intensive, hands-on training and mentoring for aspiring filmmakers across narrative, documentary, scriptwriting, and more. To date, we have worked with over 120 participants, and films created through part of the program have been shown at global festivals over 300 times.</p><p><strong>How has the launch of Quest Arabiya developed, and what does it mean for the industry?<br></strong>We have been incredibly successful in creating this channel. It is the 11th-most popular in the UAE and a top-30 channel in Saudi Arabia; it is watched in 22 Arabic-speaking countries. With the original content on Quest, we have set the same high standard in the factual entertainment space as we have in drama, impressing partners like the BBC, which has used our shows and marketing support materials to help its other licensees to elevate their own productions. The next step is to go beyond the single channel model and create versatile content to embrace the multichannel world.</p><p><strong>What are your plans for the year ahead, and how do you see the industry developing in Saudi Arabia with the lifting of restrictions on forms of entertainment?</strong><br>Abu Dhabi has gained global recognition as a leading creator of outstanding content, and winning both the BAFTA and Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for Free Solo with our long-time partner Parkes+MacDonald is a milestone that gives us even more momentum. We are also likely to have more original productions for international programmers. We have recently produced a film documenting Sheikh Zayed's efforts to save the African oryx that culminated with the Abu Dhabi Environmental Agency's release of the species back to the wild in Chad. Thanks to the leadership's confidence in us, we were able to document this incredible undertaking with a film that is now being seen around the world. Increasingly, government organizations are coming to us with their own projects, recognizing the value we bring. This will prove to be important not only for Abu Dhabi, but for the UAE as a whole. It is helping us build a critical mass of Emirati talent, which is necessary to create an industry. As far as Saudi Arabia is concerned, just as I have been advocating a national strategy for the creation of content in the UAE, we should have a regional strategy as well. It has taken us a considerable amount of money and nine years to get where we are. It makes enormous sense for the Saudis to take advantage of our experience and expertise and apply them to their scale. It is difficult to build a viable commercial industry with an audience of 1 million Emiratis, but in combination with 32 million Saudis, we can build an industry that in time will be capable of competing with any region in the world. The Saudis have been smart in first pursuing established concepts and projects that can be imported, such as Cirque du Soleil. This has demonstrated to people in the Kingdom and around the world that they are serious and committed to opening up and developing the entertainment sector. The next step to take is long-term investment in developing talent—something that cannot be bought. That will take time and patience. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>To what extent does Flash contribute to the development of Abu Dhabi as a major entertainment hub?<br></strong>Flash is the events arm of the government of Abu Dhabi, but we operate under a private sector mandate, so commercialization is our number-one priority. We are involved in conceptualizing events from production, ticket sales, marketing, communications, and backend support. Flash is incredibly diverse within its delivery scope, meaning we can oversee a Disney show, a Papal visit, a Coldplay concert, or the 2019 Asian Cup football tournament. We held several major events back-to-back in the last few years. The Pope's visit in early 2019 was attended by over 150,000 people and was the second-biggest single gathering in the UAE's history; only unification day in 1972 was larger. Flash also executed the Asian Cup, the biggest sporting event to hit the Middle East. Notably, we even beat Australia, the previous host, in terms of attendance with over 750,000 spectators.</p><p><strong>How do events raise the profile of Abu Dhabi, and what effect does this have on the overall economy?<br></strong>When presented an event opportunity, we look at how it will impact the profile of Abu Dhabi and the perception of the Middle East throughout the world. Events and activities bring a lot of attention to the UAE, and when outsiders see a Coldplay or a George Michael show it shatters misconceptions about the Middle East. Moreover, these events provide considerable economic benefits on the back of direct revenues, services, and support systems, as well as the infrastructure that needs to be in place to deliver them. Visitors are encouraged to come to the UAE, and residents have more opportunities to enjoy these events at home. These are all critical factors for our operation, and they help to pave the way for us to grow in a broader, more sophisticated way.</p><p><strong>Can the UAE act as a template for other countries in the region looking to expand their entertainment offerings and loosen restrictions?</strong><br>One of the biggest obstacles for promoters in the Middle East is bringing content from abroad to the region, which can be quite isolated from other parts of the world at times. More artists passing through places like the UAE will benefit promoters and consumers across the region as a whole. Hopefully, we will see the rise of more regional corporate partners and brand sponsors that can help with the commercial viability of the sector and build a stronger regional market. Within the UAE, there are still growth opportunities, for example in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, a market that has yet to be fully serviced.</p><p><strong>How can private-sector players collaborate with the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT)?<br></strong>Flash has worked closely with the DCT on several projects; our objectives align in many strategic areas as, ultimately, we wish to bring positive attention to Abu Dhabi and drive visitors. We are exploring new opportunities and looking at combined programs to increase the length of stay for visitors that come to Abu Dhabi for specific events. At present, a visitor can plan for activities that span several days, including concerts, mosques, museums, Formula One, tennis, and cultural events. Moreover, we can produce many ancillary events around major international properties while also highlighting Abu Dhabi's unique historical, cultural, and natural attractions.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for growth opportunities in the sector?<br></strong>We are pleased with Flash's growth and are looking at ways to expand. We want to make sure we can sustain a positive relationship with our home city and the residents of the UAE. We are also more thoughtful and deliberate in our planning when looking at our long-term goals in the Saudi market. At the same time, we are looking at horizontal integrations for some of our supply chains and how we can provide more value to our customers through our corporate partners and sponsors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[True to its roots]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[true-to-its-roots]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you situate the Rotana brand within the broader Emirati hospitality landscape?<br></strong>Rotana started in 1992 and currently has a portfolio of 112 properties, with 65 operational and the others currently under development. Rotana started as an Abu Dhabi brand and has grown to be present in 22 cities spread across 13 countries with an international and cosmopolitan client base. Our mindset as a local brand that thinks globally is reflected not only in our presence, but also in the way we operate and the standards we employ. Our philosophy is to be conscious of our roots, which lie in Middle Eastern hospitality. Rotana was formed after two friends and business associates, one of whom is an Emirati businessman, came together to create something unique but still true to the local environment. This spirit helps us avoid any pressure to compromise on our local, intimate feel as we grow. This is the cornerstone of our success and a defining factor of our future growth strategy.</p><p><strong>How have market tastes evolved in the Gulf in the last few decades, and how do these evolutions influence your business strategy?</strong><br>The local community has become more mature and better travelled, which has brought about a change in taste and approach to hospitality. There are now more two- and three-star offerings in the region in order to meet a demand for something other than ultra-luxurious offerings. As the market evolves, we now welcome more international tourists into our hotels across the region, and the number of travelers from China and India has grown substantially. The government and industry have been working together to cater to these new travelers.</p><p><strong>What are some of the biggest pressures to the bottom line in Abu Dhabi's hotel sector?<br></strong>Increased pressure on room rates as a result of new supply will be a significant challenge for hoteliers in the region. In the GCC alone, an additional 58,000 keys are expected to enter markets this year. With this, hotel operators in the region will be under real pressure to take measures that will maintain profits margins in their properties throughout the year.</p><p><strong>What have been the net effects of the reduction in municipal and tourist fees in Abu Dhabi, and the introduction of the VAT on the hotel sector?</strong><br>Initiatives from the government aimed at making Abu Dhabi a more competitive destination are always a positive step. It is too soon to clearly identify the impacts of Abu Dhabi's latest policies on reducing tourist fees and introducing VAT due to their recent nature. 2019, however, saw a succession of events and exhibitions that have brought in many guests. The loosening of visa restrictions and other initiatives aimed at making the city more competitive demonstrate the government's commitment to attracting more tourists to the Emirate. We can say these changes will have only a positive impact. Additionally, these changes do create a positive buzz, and that helps us to tell a story about positive evolution. That alone can be extremely impactful for our business.</p><p><strong>What policy recommendations do you have for the government to improve conditions in the industry?<br></strong>The Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) has been working hard to position Abu Dhabi as a new hub for major global events. There has been an impressive focus on developing events with short- and medium-term impact, like the Special Olympics and Expo 2020. Some of these larger events help to fill the hospitality offering while also providing great exposure to the Emirate and the city. Another highlight is the new airport; the project has been going on for quite some time, but considering the current market situation, it is still a relevant factor. It is all about making the destination more exciting. It is also worth highlighting Al Ain, which is an absolutely beautiful spot. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What insights do you have on the trends shaping national economies, particularly the Abu Dhabi economy?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi's government set out a clear strategy to build the Emirate's economy in the form of Economic Vision 2030 and the Abu Dhabi Plan. ADNEC is working closely with various government entities including the Department of Culture and Tourism and Abu Dhabi Convention Bureau to develop key pillars for the 12 sectors that have been identified. Furthermore, ADNEC contributes with its own economic impact. ADNEC works closely with organizers and partners to drive more business to Abu Dhabi. For example, in 2018 we contributed AED3.4 billion (USD925.67 million) to the economy, following nearly AED32 billion (USD8.7 billion) over the last decade. In terms of socioeconomic impact, we strive to bring the latest technology to our facility and create more jobs in the local market through attracting more high-profile international events to our venues.</p><p><strong>What lessons have you taken away from other markets in the MICE sector globally?<br></strong>We routinely attend events and conferences worldwide to learn about the latest trends and technologies that we can bring to ADNEC's facility in Abu Dhabi. ADNEC maintains a group of teams tasked with thinking of outside-the-box ideas. One idea that has come out of this process is the Hive, a meeting room facility with a specially designed environment that enhances the experience and interactions between listeners and speakers. Today, we have many clients who are interested in booking that space. While we originally imported the concept from outside the UAE, we have now developed it to the point where we are a leader in that space.</p><p><strong>How does ADNEC view its acquisition of ExCel London, and what other overseas markets might be of interest in the future?<br></strong>ADNEC has learned a great deal from its acquisition and improvement of the ExCel London facility. We are proud of what we have done with ExCel and appreciate the relationships we have developed with investors and partners. ExCel has also opened doors for us in the European market and taught us a great deal about the way the sector is run in Europe. Now, we have begun sending many of our local Emirati talent to be trained there, and they return as industry stars. We are currently focusing our expansion and innovation efforts on the Abu Dhabi market and on developing ExCel further. For example, we seek to replicate the Hive concept in Al Ain as well as in London. We want to show our clients we not only maintain our facilities, but also continuously upgrade them.</p><p><strong>What would be the ideal footprint of ADNEC one decade from now?<br></strong>ADNEC is the right platform for partners who want to enter this region. Our facilities in Abu Dhabi are state-of-the-art, not just by national or regional standards, but by global standards. Nonetheless, we want to be the leading venue in the region. To achieve that goal, one has to work closely with their partners, team, and suppliers. We travel to many international destinations and facilities and often see that the venue is in a poorly connected location with no hotels or taxi service. In those scenarios, people do not want to go through the trouble of attending an event. Here in Abu Dhabi, however, the government has a clear vision that connectivity and face-to-face interaction are keys to business if they are executed well. When people want to make large investments in military assets or in the oil and gas industry, for example, they like to see what they are investing in up close, in a way they can touch, feel, and interact with. That is the real value of our presence in Abu Dhabi, which is the basis on which we want to expand our footprint moving forward. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How do you see Yas Island fitting into the fabric of Abu Dhabi life?<br></strong>Yas Island has become a success story for all of Abu Dhabi to be proud of. It saw 25 million visits in 2015 and 28 million visits in 2018, which is testament to its status today as a globally recognized destination. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of Yas Island and its major theme parks, which is in part down to the unique and immersive experiences Miral has helped create on the island. Yas Island has become an entertainment hub for families and travellers, and allows them to enjoy a range of offerings. But there's more to Yas Island than theme parks, and one of its major appeals is its location: ten minutes from Abu Dhabi airport, 25 minutes from Abu Dhabi city center, and 45 minutes from Dubai airport. The master plan and the design of the island both complement its purpose. Today, Yas Island hosts seven hotels, a Formula One race track, the marina, a golf club, a shopping mall, and three theme parks.</p><p><strong>How does Miral work with Aldar to ensure that the entertainment offering enhances the residential offering?<br></strong>Both Miral and Aldar sit on the Yas Advisory Board, which meets every three months. The board is supported by sub committees for marketing, master planning, new developments, MICE events, and asset management. These sub committees cooperate on new initiatives, while the board gives strategic approval. There's excellent synergy between the stakeholders as we all share the same strategic goal, which is to position Yas Island as a top global destination for entertainment, leisure and business.</p><p><strong>What are some of the innovative planning strategies that Yas Island brings?<br></strong>Innovation is at the heart of our longterm growth strategy. Miral always puts customer experience at the core of its business. By adopting the perspective of a guest, we're able to come up with lasting strategies that make the entire Yas Island experience seamless  and unforgettable. Our vision is to connect all of our assets digitally and physically. Today, we are at Phase I in this online digital journey, and the platform will allow users to tailor and customize their experiences. We aim to add more of these combined experiences in the future. Physically, we want to make transportation between all the island's assets much faster and easier, as this will give visitors and residents the feeling of one connected resort. There's also a free shuttle bus, that allows visitors to go from hotels to popular attractions within the island in five to 10 minutes. In addition, we have a new initiative called Yas Captains, where our teams are trained to speak the language of the guest and promote all offerings on the island. This will provide visitors with a cohesive destination experience and create a unique sense of belonging.</p><p><strong>How do you plan to integrate your residential offering into the rest of the city and how can transport links be improved?<br></strong>For this, we work closely with Aldar, which owns that portfolio. Our goal is to provide our residents with services as if they are living in a resort, providing a platform where they can access different experiences and events that give them privileges as residents on the island. Consequently, we are also working hard to improve the transport links to the city for visitors. Our vision is for families to land at the airport, pick up a car, and arrive at the hotel, and once they arrive, they can use a platform to decide which experience they want for different family members. For example, this would allow various family members or travelers to enjoy the spa, play golf, and/or visit the theme parks separately. This platform means a family can share experiences, meet at night, and enjoy dinner in one of the many restaurants on offer. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>The National Ambulance is a partnership between the Social Security Fund for MOI (Fazaa Group) and Aspen Medical. Can you tell us about the value of this partnership model?<br></strong>When National Ambulance was established in 2010, we had a clear desire to partner with someone with prior expertise. We discussed partnerships with a number of entities worldwide, from places such as the US, Canada, France, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia, and even South Africa. We drew up a shortlist, and the government evaluated the options with representatives in our embassies in those countries. By 2010, the decision was made, and we had our first board meeting. 80% of the shares in National Ambulance are held by a UAE government entity and 20% by Aspen Medical. The partnership has been important in helping us meet the challenges of providing high-quality services and training and crafting our standard operating procedures (SOPs).</p><p><strong>What best practices are defining ambulance services worldwide, and how do you bring those to the UAE?<br></strong>Our policy has been to model our SOPs off countries with the highest standards. We have many international partners, such as the NAS in Ireland, the NHS in the UK, the ambulance services in Victoria and New South Wales in Australia, and some local services in Vancouver, Canada, and parts of the US, such as Seattle. The primary basis of our patient care protocols (CGP134) in the UAE comes from Ireland and the UK. We import knowledge and practices from these places and even feed them to partners elsewhere in the GCC and Asia. The UAE National Ambulance has been called upon numerous times to attend meetings in the region to review other nations' outcomes and protocols. The path is long, but we are on the right track.</p><p><strong>What is being done to involve more Emirati nationals into the medical sector, particularly as paramedics and ambulance workers?</strong><br>It is important for Emiratis to start immersing themselves in the health system and learning about it, and we have been doing this for nearly three years now. Paramedic work can be particularly challenging for local trainees because, for many of them, it will have been the first time they have been in such close proximity to the kinds of tragedy we deal with. We need to teach them many skills, so they can be prepared physically, mentally, and psychologically. When we designed our training programs for Emirati nationals, we reviewed the internships done by the Ministry of Interior, Abu Dhabi Police, Dubai Police, Dubai Ambulance, and the Ministry of Health in order to determine the best ways to empower and encourage them to be a part of National Ambulance. We started our training program officially in 2017, and the first and second cohort has graduated. Today, we are at the point where the program has so many applicants that we can be extremely selective for our third cohort.</p><p><strong>How can we expect the business model of National Ambulance to evolve in the coming years?<br></strong>We recently announced an expansion into the Northern Emirates, and we are working with a number of government entities to ensure our successes elsewhere in the UAE are replicated there. In terms of our business model, at this stage all our services are being paid for by the government and by semi-government, private shares. We need to make sure we are introducing a model that is independently financially sustainable, which means creating standalone, self-funded services. We are successfully moving toward that. In the Northern Emirates, where we are introducing an insurance program, we have recovered around 35% of the cost from that. Other factors are on our mind for future protocol and communications, such as engaging with the community and encouraging a prevention-oriented mentality that creates a culture of health. Our goal is to make sure that the UAE's National Ambulance leads the world by example. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is the strategy behind Mubadala Healthcare's investments, and how do they aim to address Abu Dhabi's healthcare needs?</strong><br>Mubadala Healthcare aims to bridge the gaps within healthcare by engaging in partnerships with best-in-class international healthcare partners. Our partnership with Imperial College London in the UK to bring the Imperial College London Diabetes Center (ICDLC) to the UAE is an example of how we aim to address pressing local healthcare issues through partnerships. Diabetes is a burden in the UAE and region in terms of chronic disease and lifestyle management associated with diabetes care. After witnessing the success of ICLDC's contribution in targeting the disease, we started to pursue further partnerships that would bring a similar quality of care to other areas of specialization in the UAE. Consequently, we negotiated a partnership and created a platform to establish Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, the first time the healthcare operator agreed to expand outside of North America. We took every step necessary to guarantee the patient experience in Abu Dhabi met the same high standards of quality. This was achieved not only through building state-of-the-art medical facilities, but also close collaboration between the hospitals, and ensuring our world-class doctors and caregivers share a patient-centric approach. When we opened, we thought we were purely addressing a gap in the local market, though now we have found people in other countries travelling to Abu Dhabi for care too.</p><p><strong>What synergies are created across these different entities and assets from a healthcare perspective, and how are they aligned with Mubadala Healthcare's targets?</strong><br>Through specialized institutes and centers of excellence across our assets, world-class doctors and surgeons, state-of-the-art medical and screening facilities, telemedicine services and long-term, post-acute care and homecare, we have created a fully comprehensive portfolio that addresses the needs of the healthcare sector in Abu Dhabi. We constantly find opportunities to tie in services and expertise across our network that enhance the patient experience and outcomes. From a wider perspective, Mubadala has transitioned from being a development company to an investment company. Our approach to healthcare has been to drive productive change in the industry toward sustainability, while also raising the quality of care. While our focus is providing world-class care, promoting population health, and driving medical education and research, we are also conscious of a double bottom line: financial and socio-economic sustainability. Healthcare differs from many industries because the services contribute to society both directly and indirectly. Meanwhile, we are also presented with the opportunity to leverage the IP that we have built and create disruptive innovation in the market internationally.</p><p><strong>What innovations has Mubadala sought to attract to its healthcare service offerings, and why did it decide to invest in the Abu Dhabi Telemedicine Center?<br></strong>Research and innovation are key strategies to develop a leading healthcare network enabled to organically evolve in a sustainable manner. To that, we have launched the “Test Beds" initiative at Mubadala Healthcare to source innovative solutions, screen them, and then pilot them within a Mubadala healthcare facility. In practice, this is done through many platforms and approaches. We look at the needs of our facilities, through close collaboration and focus groups that include our caregivers. We also utilize the resources we have within the Mubadala network to tap in to innovative projects. We are actively looking at opportunities and solutions whether in healthcare IT, big data, AI wearables, medical services, or biotechnology research to be implemented in three areas: clinical care and prevention, digital health, and healthcare delivery models. With regard to telemedicine, about seven years ago we saw an opportunity to serve the market beyond our brick-and-mortar services and created a telemedicine platform. I am extremely enthusiastic about this service because of the convenience it provides, particularly for those in remote areas. In addition, we have an application that utilizes video conferencing capabilities to deliver further detailed diagnoses. Overall, such services are the future, and we will see a global shift to more telemedicine services. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

We found that the education and healthcare sectors were lacking compared to others globally. Our vision is to assess problems that can be addressed by a technological solution. Thus, we launched with a vision to touch 1 billion lives through technology. Our strategy centers around developing innovative solutions that can be implemented across the globe, while aligning with the latest advancements of the fourth industrial revolution. As global businesses rise to meet consumer demands, we aim to lead the way from the heart of the UAE, in Abu Dhabi. This strategy aligns with our main objective, which is to contribute to strengthening the position of the UAE as a global hub for entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts. At our core, we define, design, and disrupt. We define global industry-specific challenges and design high-end solutions to improve the quality of life for people across different regions, thus disrupting industries. In 2016, we brought together innovative people from technical and human sciences to develop solutions that can genuinely spark an impact across their industries. Today, our technologies and AI-powered solutions are spread across the country. We have produced solutions across various sectors, including healthcare, government services, education, retail, entrepreneurship, UAVs, and much more. Despite being based in the UAE, we have already gone global. We have established partnerships in the US, the Netherlands, and Singapore and have presented in conferences around the world. We are proud to have already gone global in just a few years, and we aim to continue toward achieving our vision of impacting a billion lives across the planet.</p><p><strong>How do you work with stakeholders or institutions within these sectors to develop solutions?<br></strong>We have built close relationships with many major entities, and these relationships foster significant knowledge exchange. We have a measured approach to implementation, which means we can supply technologies that are appropriate for different scenarios. This process is also an opportunity for us to learn along the way. We also bring people together from diverse technological spectrums. We have experts from engineering, innovation, and investment backgrounds. When confronted with a challenge, we draw on all these backgrounds and find an appropriate solution. This is important because we follow a holistic approach. When you follow a holistic approach to business, you can better tackle challenges that come along the way, and you become equipped with the knowledge to build well-rounded solutions.</p><p><br><strong>Where do you see your solutions playing a role in the next five years?<br></strong>The wise leadership of the UAE continues to lead and encourage a culture of innovation in the country, and there is awareness that technological adoption carries a positive impact on society. I see our solutions growing on a larger scale and potentially enhancing the quality of everyday life for people in the UAE. AI, for example, has developed into something that comprises many practical functions. Moreover, the utilization of data helps guide decision-makers in making effective choices. The business landscape will be different in 20 years. If we look at successful organizations like Amazon, Airbnb, and Careem, they became successful not because of substantial investment in assets but through creativity. In today's globalized world, most people are educated and fully capable of applying their skills. It is up to us to engage these creative innovators and give them the platform to let their ideas become a reality. Fortunately for us, the government encourages the adoption of these broader trends. I fundamentally believe this region has a lot to offer, and I am fortunate that we are living in an era where we can contribute and touch as many lives as possible in a positive and impactful way. We are pleased to support the ecosystem and look forward to many exciting years ahead. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about Microsoft's positioning within the UAE and MENA IT sectors?<br></strong>Microsoft has been in the region for decades and has been a significant contributor to technological advancement in the region. Our goal is to enable businesses and governments to use IT services to deliver on their objectives and transform their societies. MENA covers a large area, with pockets that are as advanced and maybe even more than other regions. Some of our customers here, in government as well as enterprise, use cutting-edge technologies that Microsoft uses to develop its own product sets globally. There are locations where we are working predominantly on the infrastructure layer, helping to build a vibrant IT base that can act as a springboard for national development and close skills or education gaps. In other, more advanced locations, like the UAE, we are working with local enterprises and government institutions to help them adopt today's most transformative technologies, from IoT, AI, and blockchain and quantum computing. Overall, we are well positioned in a market that is keen to adopt the most advanced technology solutions.</p><p><strong>What impact does investing in advanced technologies have on a company's bottom line in the Middle East, and what is Microsoft doing to ensure that such investments pay off?</strong><br>Microsoft has seen some cases with a number of our key customers, as well as government agencies, where adopting our cloud architecture results in an immediate benefit to their bottom line. However, that is not the most exciting part. The real benefit is when our customers' adoption of cloud technologies transforms their policies, their interaction with their customers, and ultimately their whole business model. That is when we see them really disrupt their markets and give themselves what I call a 'risk insurance certificate' against being disrupted by competitors and other industries. We have great examples of disruption, from banking to insurance and even agriculture, in companies that have really sought to use these technologies not just for immediate cost savings, but to really affect their customers and the societies in which they are operating.</p><p><strong>How can large corporations like Microsoft help companies alleviate cyber fatigue and better prepare for cloud adoption?<br></strong>One of the biggest inhibitors to adopting and embracing new technology is a lack of necessary prerequisite skills. We are sharing something we call the cloud-readiness model or the cloud-adoption framework, which helps enterprises and governments examine their readiness for adoption. We have also embarked on a number of activities over the past few years, including Microsoft Cloud Society, an online education and up-skilling portal that helps individuals and corporations educate their employees on cloud skills. With Etihad Airways, we have helped to create an AI Academy to train their employees—not just the IT teams, but other employees as well—in understanding AI and embracing new technology in their daily business. These kinds of initiatives, once carried out in an adequate and scalable way, have a massive impact end-to-end.</p><p><strong>What do you see as the role of the private sector here in the UAE in democratizing AI and delivering its benefits correctly?<br></strong>I would compare the role of AI in democratizing information today to the role of the printing press in the 15th century. We are lucky to be in this era and to witness this type of change. The word “democratizing" is key in AI because we have to ensure that we are providing AI solutions for every individual and every government or organization, regardless of their size. That is why we are on a mission to democratize AI. That mission is founded on driving AI adoption in a fair, sustainable, and scalable way, including with our 17,800 partners in the MENA region. We want to help them to develop their applications and services using Microsoft's AI engine, so that it can reach the public in an ethical, fair, and scalable manner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Accenture's mandate within the UAE, and what makes the UAE a good regional base for an organization that is involved in strategy, consultancy, and digital transformation?</strong><br>The UAE is an excellent market for Accenture due to its appetite for innovation and transformation. There is a strong willingness to transform and implement the best technological practices from other regions to create superior experiences for visitors, expatriates, and consumers. The UAE is a country with a long-term vision that aligns well with our aims. Accenture aims to enable transformation in a long-term context rather than addressing the short-term cost equation. We bring all the different kinds of support together, from strategy and technology to digital and operations. The UAE serves as a platform for the GCC market because it is a place where we can attract talent from all over the world.</p><p><strong>The UAE aims to encourage deeper cooperation between the public and private sectors. Within the context of co-creation and realizing shared objectives, where have you observed productive outcomes as a result of deeper public-private sector engagement?</strong><br>The Middle East has excellent opportunities for PPPs. The process has started for most of the ecosystem, so you can easily combine the public and private sectors to deliver superior results. Tourism is one obvious example where this combination can offer exceptional outcomes. Similarly, real estate and infrastructure PPPs are converging together to deliver smart cities. Infrastructure, along with the energy transition, is another such area. Accenture aims to help this process. Our global business is mostly private-sector driven, so the collaboration between the two sectors is something that is at the core of our DNA.<br></p><p><strong>What were the driving factors behind the establishment of Accenture's hospitality and tourism innovation hub?<br></strong>Our annual innovation maturity index for the UAE indicates areas of potential. We estimate that USD575 billion is the trapped value that can be unlocked through digital transformation and the extensive use of digital technology. We assess how to bring data analytics, blockchain technology, and AI into an applied context for an industry. Moreover, we decided to localize what Accenture globally calls “innovation architecture." We support innovation and industry through research, labs, start-up inclusion, innovation centers, and factories. The tourism innovation hub aims to bring in ideas from elsewhere to create an environment that will shape innovation in the Middle East. The aim is to have the ability to accelerate and apply those innovations with relevance to the local and global markets. Within our innovation hub, we are leveraging data because we believe in the data revolution and the ability to capture, manage, and use data to make effective decisions. This is a game-changer. According to our studies, on average, around 70% of businesses are not yet ready in terms of capturing, managing and using data in their daily decision making. That ability is one of the key drivers of digital performance, and this is what we support through our innovation hub.</p><p><strong>Accenture is the digital services partner of Dubai Expo 2020. What are your expectations for the event?<br></strong>Accenture is a premier partner of Expo 2020. Before the event, we have been involved in different capacities. During the event, our role is to deliver a superior experience to visitors. We aim to showcase the potential of Accenture, so we will bring some global content and make it accessible at the Expo site. Most of our global clients will be brought to the Expo on a curated visit to show them the latest from the world in their specific industries or areas of interest within the Expo's theme of mobility, opportunity, and sustainability. Overall, we are excited about being able to do this and have an impact on Accenture's global agenda. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>When we look at sectors such as logistics, tourism, infrastructure, and air cargo, we understand that the UAE does not just say things, but makes them happen. We did not invent the airplane, maritime trade, or tourism, and did not have any of the fundamental cornerstones that make the UAE a leader in these sectors. But today, because of the vision and drive of our leadership, we were able to become global leaders in each of these sectors. Our strategy revolves around that. It revolves around making the UAE one of the leading countries in AI in the next 10 years. </p><p>We are entering a new decade, that of the digital revolution and AI. The UAE has certain advantages that make it a lot more prone to being a leader in AI than many other countries. We have 200 nationalities living and thriving here, and if you understand anything about AI, you know that AI lives on data. The importance of data has three Vs: volume, velocity, and variety of data. These 200 nationalities give us the variety. We have the most diverse data set on the planet. When it comes to the volume of data, the UAE has platforms that are local but operate globally. Just look at our port's operator, DP World, an operator that came out of the UAE but operates more than 68 ports and terminals around the world. The data center they have is more valuable than any other port's on the planet. The same can be said about Etihad and Emirates Airlines, which fly to more than 166 destinations around the world and are the biggest airlines in the world. These have the most important and unique data set when it comes to air travel. Finally, when we look at velocity, there has been a long transformation process that the UAE has been going through since 2002, which took us from being a traditional government to being an electronic, digital, mobile, and then smart government by 2015. It took many years of planning and implementation to become a leading government of the future. Today, we are ready for this transformation process and can become a cutting-edge country that exports technologies to the rest of the world. <br>The UAE's AI strategy revolves around three main foundations. The first is talent and capacity building. Only by attracting and retaining the right talent from around the world can the UAE become the leading country when it comes to AI. Some of you may ask why this talent would come to the UAE. This is because the UAE offers a unique quality of life. We have the mobility that no one else has. You can be in the UAE and access any market in one day through a direct flight. Also, the UAE offers a legislative process that is very agile and very flexible. So experts from around the world can come and deploy their solutions on the ground in the UAE in the most effective manner. We also believe in the need to create homegrown talent. We have also launched many programs to empower the youth of the UAE to understand AI and how it can give them the ability to understand whether they want to become doctors, lawyers, engineers, or join another sector. <br>The second part of this is the policymaking framework. In most countries, policies are made, and the private sector, academia, and people leading the effort are forced to abide by it. In the UAE, we have more of a consultative approach where we work with the private sector and academia to ensure everyone is happy with the direction we are moving in. Most importantly, then, is the question of responsibly deploying AI in key government sectors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[stepping-stone]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you walk us through Bloom Education's education philosophy?<br></strong>Bloom Education is highly aligned with the Abu Dhabi Vision 2030, which includes specific aims to improve the quality of education in Abu Dhabi. We work closely in partnership with globally recognized international schools to ensure our students experience the best quality of education in caring, supportive, and tolerant environments. In 2011, we opened our first Brighton College in Abu Dhabi, followed by Brighton College Al Ain in 2013 and Brighton College Dubai in 2018. Our schools benefit from the strong links we have with Brighton College UK; not only are our academic results consistently exceptional, but our schools in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain are both ranked as outstanding by the Department of Education and Knowledge in Abu Dhabi (ADEK). More recently, we partnered with Dwight School to open and operate its first school in the Middle East, in Dubai. We are also extraordinarily proud to have been awarded the operation and management of three charter schools by ADEK in 2019. The success of these partnerships in the UAE gives us an advantage to expand into other GCC countries. Besides taking our international brands abroad, we are also exploring how we can deliver more affordable high-quality education in the UAE.</p><p><strong>What are some other gaps within the education sector?<br></strong>The education sector in the UAE has certainly changed over the past couple of years. When it comes to education pathways, vocational studies is the obvious gap for some students as an alternative to high school or IB diplomas, GCSE, and A Levels, as not all students desire to become engineers, doctors, or lawyers. Vocational qualifications, such as B-Tech, offer a different route to university and are a mainstay in major education systems throughout the world. Unfortunately, these qualifications are not currently recognized in the UAE, meaning that they do count when it comes to obtaining the necessary equivalency certificate from the Ministry of Education for local students, which is essential for them to attend local or GCC universities.</p><p><strong>What are some of the fundamental skills and attitudes being taught at Bloom Education?<br></strong>As education providers, our role is clear: we must prepare our students for the workplace of tomorrow by providing learning environments and experiences that encourage and develop entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership skills beyond the classroom. It is difficult to know what skills the future job market will require; however, we can develop our students to think critically and have an inquisitive mindset. Engaging our students in their own learning is key, whether through project-based learning, innovative teaching methods, or embedding technology into our curriculum. We have introduced technology across all of our schools; a recent example being the introduction of Lego labs to teach physics, math, and creativity at our charter schools. It is essential to train our teachers effectively on how to integrate technology into their lessons. Entrepreneurship and innovation programs also play a key part. At Dwight School, the Spark Tank teaches K-12 students entrepreneurial, innovation, and leadership skills where they can apply for grants to develop and take their novel ideas and inventions with real-world application into the marketplace.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for Bloom Education, and what are your main priorities going forward?<br></strong>Education in this region is still very much on a growth trajectory, and our focus is to expand across the GCC with our international brands and enter the local mid-tier/affordable market. We also want to expand our charter schools program in partnership with the government. Also, we have a strong desire to develop vocational pathways in our schools once these are recognized by the Ministry of Education. There may also be an opportunity in the future to establish a training programme within our schools in partnership with local universities to develop a pool of talented local teachers. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you walk us through some of the recent milestones? <br></strong>As the leader in engineering excellence and innovation for over three decades, Sanad Aerotech has added several historic milestones to its steadily growing list of achievements in 2019. We re-branded from Turbine Services &amp; Solutions to Sanad, which signaled our readiness to embrace the future and re-enforced our unwavering commitment to placing our customers at the centre of our growth strategy. Our re-branding then got off to a flying start as we signed, within the same year, key agreements totaling more than AED24.5 billion. This considerable achievement has re-enforced our standing as a leader in the global  maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) industry and showed the global market's growing confidence in Abu Dhabi's and the UAE's leadership in the global aerospace sector. The signed contracts have also re-affirmed our status as a trusted, reliable and long-term partner for some of the world's largest OEMs, including Rolls-Royce, GE Aviation, and International Aero Engines (IAE), and the preferred aircraft engine MRO solutions provider for well-established and fastest growing international commercial airlines across the globe. Our standing as a Trent 700 Authorized Maintenance Center was confirmed through the nine-year AED24-billion deal we signed with Rolls-Royce at the Paris Airshow. This will effectively triple the number of Trent 700 engines we service annually from 25 to 75. We have diversified our product mix and added the most successful engine program in the history of commercial aviation into our portfolio as we signed a new landmark 15-year deal with GE valued at AED500 million. With around 18,000 LEAP engines designed for single-aisle aircraft in the delivery backlog, Sanad will become the first company to provide MRO solutions for the LEAP engine to the South Asian, Middle Eastern, and North African markets by 2021. We have also embarked on a digitalization strategy and early adoption of 4IR technologies at our 15,000-sqm state-of-the-art turbine repair facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport. By doing so, we are now the first aircraft engine MRO solutions provider in the world to employ several advanced technologies under one roof. Our future focus will be on delivering upon our commitments. To this end, we will further invest in our people, resources, and facilities, as well as deploy more cutting-edge 4IR technological innovations. This will increase our capacity to serve an increasingly competitive global market, as well as empower us to further expand and diversify our capabilities to support the growth and global operations of OEM partners and international commercial airline customers.</p><p><strong>What are some of the ways that you work directly with airlines and OEMs? <br></strong>Sanad Aerotech's strategy focuses on forming strong alliances with OEMs and leading global airlines. With our state-of-the-art capabilities, three and a half decades of engineering excellence, approvals from 17 civil aviation authorities, and confidence of OEMs, we will continue to strengthen our direct relationships with airlines across the world, such as TAP in Portugal, LATAM Airlines in Latin America, and Asiana in South Korea. Our partnerships with Ethiopian Airlines and Emirates Airline provide strategic opportunities that will support our business vision and growth. Our MoU with Emirates Airline through its leading aircraft engine MRO division, Emirates Engine Maintenance Centre (EEMC), is of great significance as it involves two homegrown aerospace giants. With a combined experience of over 60 years, opportunities are abound for the UAE aerospace industry to create aircraft engine MRO centers of excellence and build dedicated repair and training capabilities.</p><p><strong>What indicators do you use to project the growth of your business?<br></strong>Our business has experienced significant growth, and our future expansion is spurred by a growing global MRO market. We served 94 engines in 2018 and 125 in 2019. To support the delivery of the newly won contracts of AED24.5 billion, we will expand our engine MRO capacity from around 175 to 200 in the next two years. This means we need to double our output by end-2021. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the hospitality sector performed in the last few years?<br></strong>The number of hotel offerings in Abu Dhabi has stabilized in the last few years, with the growth in demand exceeding the additional supply in the market. Hence, the industry witnessed a double-digit growth in RevPAR in the upscale hotel submarket. As per STR reports, the market expects further growth in 2020. Main markets such as India, China, the UK, and Russia continue to lead growth, while some secondary markets such as Ukraine, Belgium, and South Korea have witnessed double-digit growth.</p><p><strong>How would you place the Jannah Burj Al Sarab hotel within Abu Dhabi's hospitality sector? What new amenities have been added to the hotel?</strong><br>Jannah Burj Al Sarab Hotel is an award-winning five-star hotel within the local hospitality sector. It is the flagship of our group, boasting 318 rooms and suites with various ancillary facilities. Our property is considered among the latest sustainable buildings, with main features such as rooftop solar panels and availing the latest in smart energy management solutions.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us about how you approach the guest experience at the Jannah Burj Al Sarab? Why do the hotels under your portfolio resonate so well with guests?</strong><br>Our guest-centric culture is our unique offering. Our talents are dedicated to offering the best service. Over the past year, we have established a strategic partnership with the best international platforms such as TRUSTYOU to monitor guest feedback and continuously work toward improving and rectifying any shortfalls. We managed to maintain a ranking among the top 20 hotels within Abu Dhabi since opening and continuously strive to maintain and improve this status in the last few years.<br><br><strong>How does sustainability feature across the Jannah Hotels &amp; Resorts group? Furthermore, how can we drive further sustainability across the hospitality sector?</strong><br>We strongly believe a major part of sustainability is in the day-to-day practice. We take pride in our commitment to reducing our carbon impact. The implementation plan among our team members in various departments is set with clear KPIs that are reviewed on a monthly basis. Some of our implemented drives include water consumption reduction, paper recycling, single-use plastic reduction, and waste segregation.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the tourism sector in Abu Dhabi, and can the industry grow? What are some of the ways the sector can work collaboratively to ensure Abu Dhabi differentiates itself in the region?</strong><br>The Tourism and Culture Authority plays a leading role in the industry growth to the benefit of all sub sectors, including hotels. We work closely with them to ensure we benefit from the new markets and align our packages with the Emirate's positioning as a leisure and cultural hub, not only a business destination.</p><p><strong>What will be the implications of the further adoption of technology across the hospitality industry?<br></strong>Technology is an ever-evolving component that is affecting most industries including the travel and hospitality industry. We have to continuously invest in this sector to match our more tech-savvy guests. We recently launched a revamped website that offers a multilingual feature and various additions to enhance the content for visitors. Finally, I am pleased to share the Jannah Hotels &amp; Resorts will be opening its sixth property in Dubai later in 2020 by the Creekside. The hotel will be latest addition to our existing properties in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Ras Al Khaimah. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you rate the maturity of the cybersecurity sector in the UAE and the wider region?<br></strong>Cybersecurity is a nascent sector in the Middle East, and the discourse around it is still in the making. I would dissect the question of its maturity along three layers: framing the discussion, formulating sound strategies, and executing them effectively. In the UAE, the consideration of cybersecurity is starting to take root in policy and strategy development, with the first federal strategy emerging in 2010. Anchoring the discussion on cybersecurity within the most senior circles of government and business is crucial. In terms of strategy readiness, I would qualify it as a work in progress. This is not specific only to the UAE, but something we see around the world. The reason is two-fold. Cybersecurity is a developing field, but on top of that, it is a field whose technologies, practices, and implications move at a speed unseen in other sectors. Discussions about strategy need to be well-crafted, and we need to know we have a handle on the cybersecurity agenda, both in the public and private sectors; only then can sound policies be made. After that, we come to the third layer, which is the need to make sure policy is executed clearly, with the right checks and balances in place. What we are observing around the world is that in countries with a higher cybersecurity threat level, there is an incentive to take on a more advanced stance. The UAE is in this group. The country has been a formidable and progressive socioeconomic platform in a region where geopolitical tensions are prevalent. Therefore, the UAE needs to have a robust stance from a cybersecurity standpoint, to defend both the nation and its private institutions. With the right policy and execution, we can have the peace of mind that there will be business continuity. What is rewarding is to see that the issue is taking center-stage on the agenda of policy-makers, and I would say that the UAE is more advanced than other nations.</p><p><strong>Societies are increasingly centralizing their data. Why is that important?<br></strong>The discipline of applied analytics tells us that the bigger the dataset, the more useful it is going to be. If, for example, I want to determine the best way to develop and drive investment to a city, or to maximize livability, I need to be able to access data related to different sectors to see where transformation is required. In the end, the most efficient way to do this is to federate the data. Whether you are a CEO or a president, your number-one responsibility is to make informed decisions. By design, or by accident, data will increasingly have to be federated and made available on platforms accessible to both the public and private sectors. The key is to ensure proper checks and balances, because the last thing you want is to make the data totally transparent and exposed to manipulation. DarkMatter was created with the view that although there is a lot the government can do from a digitalization and cybersecurity standpoint, there has to be a contribution from the private sector as well.</p><p><strong>What is the most important thing to keep in mind for companies looking to enter the UAE market and stay resilient? <br></strong>Companies coming to the UAE are entering an economy that is highly digitalized. They need to come in prepared to enter such an ecosystem. The bar is already high, so they cannot come in with the traditional ways of doing things. They have to have the cybersecurity checks and balances in place, and they need to connect with the relevant agencies. You need to develop an understanding of the different players in the ecosystem and know that no one entity has the silver bullet. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[win-win-for-all]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you place the W Abu Dhabi — Yas Island within the UAE's hospitality sector?<br></strong>W Abu Dhabi-Yas Island was built in 2009 and has since been an iconic landmark, not just on the island but for Abu Dhabi. In the last 18 months, it underwent an extensive design overhaul and was rebranded as W Abu Dhabi-Yas Island, marking the debut of Marriott International's iconic W brand to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Just a 15-minute drive from Abu Dhabi International Airport and a mere 30-minute drive into the city, W Abu Dhabi-Yas Island is surrounded by iconic landmarks and a wide range of attractions including theme parks, shopping malls, a golf course, beach, and a marina. The arrival of the W in Abu Dhabi marks a new chapter for both the brand and the city. Being a part of Marriott International, the hotel is accessible to over 140 million global Marriott Bonvoy members, who can earn points, enjoy benefits as well as redeem their points at this iconic location or enjoy experiences that provide access like no other. We are a large hotel with 499 rooms, which allows us to be an attractive destination for MICE or group business. The Formula One race weekend is a highly anticipated event on hotels' calendars. While this is perhaps one of the busiest weekends for us from a business perspective, there is always an exciting calendar of events that allow us to engage with the local community on an ongoing basis.</p><p><strong>How did the F1 race weekend in 2019 serve as a launch platform for the new brand, and in what ways do you feel you captured audience attention?</strong><br>F1 was a great opportunity for us to introduce the brand and showcase our refreshed design. We were also able to introduce the DNA of the brand and its energy through activities around the hotel and set ourselves apart from anything else Abu Dhabi has seen before. The vibe and energy we created by bringing the brand to life across guest experiences, and touch points were indeed helpful to attract and engage the glitz and glamour of F1. From music, dance, entertainment, F&amp;B, and the programming, we were able to build a momentum that will only help us going forward.</p><p><strong>What type of training, development, skills, or attitudes do you try to impart on the staff?<br></strong>The W brand service philosophy is built around the Whatever, Whenever mindset—whatever guests want, whenever they want it—as long as it is legal, we will make it happen. That is the mindset we want to instill in our associates, and we do this while respecting the local culture. We have six service foundations that define us, and they have just been recently launched globally throughout the W brand. Our staff must be able to practice and execute these foundations. They need to be engaged in the service and in tune with our guests. This is what brings the W brand culture alive.</p><p><strong>In what way do you see the tourism and hospitality sector collaboratively working towards attracting more tourists?<br></strong>I see the hospitality sector and the tourism boards working together with a collaborative approach to be the success of any destination. We are fortunate that both Abu Dhabi and Dubai tourism boards are extremely active and keep positioning the destinations globally. I see the two Emirates as complementary to each other, and this gives us the opportunity to do more. Expansion is never enough. It brings opportunities, and it brings people to the destination. Bringing the right entertainment to the destination is crucial. By combining what Dubai and Abu Dhabi have to offer for groups who travel to the UAE, we will be able to attract more tourists into the region. It can only be a win-win, and we look forward to playing a more active role in making this happen. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of JCDecaux, and how it has evolved since its inception? <br></strong>JCDecaux is the worldwide leader for outdoor advertising and the preferred partner of municipal authorities. We contribute to the development of cities worldwide by providing state-of-the-art street furniture and services to the public. JCDecaux partners with over 4,000 cities globally, including Paris, where the company is headquartered. Our product offerings have evolved through time to ensure relevancy to an ever-more connected and mobile audience. Today, we accompany cities with smart street furniture that offer contextualized content based on real-time information for greater engagement, charging stations, or Wi-Fi hotspots to remain connected at all times, or sustainable mobility systems with self-service bicycle schemes. In addition, JCDecaux also contributes to a city's beautification with a strong commitment to aesthetics. We partner with more than 50 international designers and architects, such as Stark, Villemotte, and Zaha Hadid, to create iconic structures. More than an advertising operator, we consider ourselves a long-term partner of cities, contributing to create vibrant urban experiences. </p><p><strong>How does JCDecaux approach the Abu Dhabi market, and what is your relationship with the Emirate?<br></strong>Many nations in this region are developing a long-term diversification strategy, leveraging on transportation, connectivity, and innovation, making the region and Abu Dhabi more specifically, a territory of opportunities for JCDecaux. We have been committed to Abu Dhabi since 2013, when we were awarded the exclusive advertising concession at Abu Dhabi International Airport. In May 2019, our successful partnership with the airport authority was further acknowledged as the company was awarded a similar 10-year concession at the Midfield Terminal, a truly iconic infrastructure where we will be deploying a state-of-the-art digital offering. We are also having interesting discussions with municipal authorities and believe that the government's strategy to promote PPPs is a strong signal that highlights the role and contribution of the private sector to the long-term development of the country. In October 2018, we signed an MoU with the Department of Urban Planning and Municipalities of Abu Dhabi and hold regular discussions with the newly created Abu Dhabi Investment Office to share best practices to encourage investment in the outdoor media platform and the street furniture platform locally. </p><p><strong>How does JCDecaux differentiate itself? <br></strong>Through regular contact with authorities worldwide, we have built best practices and defined a strong vision of how we can contribute to renewed urban experiences. This is through our ambitious out-of-home and digital out-of-home advertising programs that are based on long-term collaborative partnerships and aim to encourage innovation, entrepreneurship, and investment. These are essential in leading the transformation of our business into the digital era.</p><p><strong>What market trends will have the biggest impact on your industry? <br></strong>In our industry today, digital disruption is having a major impact. There is a major opportunity in this transformation for outdoor media to combine the reach of one of the only remaining mass media channels available in the public space with precise targeting capabilities. By allowing digitalization to engage specific audience profiles we would bring significant growth perspectives. Over the next few years, being able to contextualize content on real-time basis will be a major differentiating point, and this has already proven to be positive in terms of driving the growth of our media. It will be essential to invest massively in the right tools, both hardware and software, and define an ambitious data strategy to qualify audiences and make communication more agile and targeted. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you tell us about your current portfolio of products, and how you feel the brand resonates with consumers in the Middle East?<br></strong>The Nespresso story started with a simple but revolutionary idea: enable everyone to create a cup of coffee just like a skilled barista. Since 1986, our innovations have redefined the way millions of people enjoy their coffee, growing from a ground-breaking idea in Switzerland to a global brand with presence in 76 countries. With the touch of a button, customers everywhere can enjoy high-quality, sustainably produced coffee. As we continue to grow, we remain relentlessly focused on delivering the ultimate coffee experience to our customers around the world. Nespresso has been present in the Middle East for more than 20 years. In MEA, we operate through appointed local agents. Currently, we are present in the GCC and select African markets with our original line, which is the traditional espresso and lungo coffees, and with our professional line for HoReCa and offices. Moreover, in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait, we launched the Vertuo line in September 2019. In our product portfolio, we have 29 coffees for the original line, 13 for the professional line, and 28 for the Vertuo line.</p><p><strong>What factors led to the development of the Vertuo coffee line? Moreover, what are your expectations for this line in the UAE market?</strong><br>Vertuo was first launched in North America in 2014 and has been rolled out since in several markets in Europe and Asia. We based our decision to launch Vertuo line in this region on consumer habits. We noticed that coffee consumption in the Middle East has many cultural influences, where there is Arabic coffee, Turkish coffee, Lebanese coffee, soluble coffee, espresso, cappuccino, and more. Nevertheless, the common feature we see is a preference for a larger cup of coffee. Results also showed that consumers in the Middle East are tech savvy. Vertuo was a natural fit as it offers technology, simplicity, and versatility. We use centrifusion, a unique rotational extraction technology that reads the capsule's barcode and adjusts extraction parameters to create the perfect full-bodied coffee, finished with a silky and generous crema.</p><p><strong>How has your R&amp;D advanced since the inception of Nespresso? In what ways has consumer demand evolved over the last 30 years?</strong><br>Since 1986, continuous innovation and passion for providing highest quality coffee in every cup have been driving our quest to consistently bring new coffee pleasures to consumers at home and away from home. Through the years we have been able to source the finest green coffee from coffee producing countries and have even revived origins to offer unique blends. Our experts select, roast, and grind each blend that is then sealed in capsules for optimum freshness of aromas. Every year we launch new machines, permanent and limited-edition coffees, and accessories. We have built direct relationships with our customers, allowing us to anticipate their needs and tailor our offering and services based on the insights they provide. We therefore continue to spearhead innovations in our products, offering convenience, ease of use, and unique coffee blends.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about the sustainability aspects of your business?<br></strong>Our sustainability program is called the Positive Cup. We work closely with more than 100,000 farmers. These farmers are supported by more than 400 agronomists who provide assistance and advice. They teach farmers how to produce coffee sustainably, how to manage water properly, how to use shading techniques, and when to plant new trees to make the farms more environmentally friendly. Another element of the Positive Cup is our recycling program, which began soon after we started producing coffee. Club members can bring recycled coffee capsules to the boutiques. We can also collect capsules from their homes or offices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Alibaba Cloud recently made a strategic decision to expand its operations and widen its spectrum of services. What signal does this send regarding the direction of the company in the Middle East?</strong></p><p>Alibaba is the first global public cloud to have a data center in the Middle East. We have dedicated teams in the UAE to explore partnerships with suitable organizations. Strategically, our aim is to have the UAE as the center of our Middle East and Africa operations.</p><p><strong>What specific conditions do you assess when you approach this market?<br></strong>Throughout the region, the internet and business start-up activity is very active. There are many technological innovations taking place here. Alibaba Cloud has developed a clear ecosystem strategy for its business operations in this market. An integral part of this plan will involve building meaningful partnerships with more local players. We consider the UAE as the gateway to the rest of the region, and the Middle East is truly the bridge to territories further afield like Africa. We are fortunate to have many local partners here and have been steadily building our operations at a healthy pace. Every year, we have programs for our partners and start-ups. For example, we have a program called Create where developers and start-ups can share their creative ideas. There is an abundance of creative ideas and vision across the country. There are talented people within the local technology sector, which is a boon for our business and the entire ecosystem.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy for engaging with local partners, and how is Alibaba leveraging its global capabilities to bring solutions to the UAE?</strong><br>In terms of partnerships, this is something we consider to be our future. Alibaba is a platform company, and we are heavily involved in building ecosystems. We view the cloud business as a long-term endeavor; however, we cannot build this solely by ourselves, and healthy partnerships are crucial. In regards to digitalization, different levels of partnerships are required, such as system integrators, ISPs, digital consultants, and more. It requires different types of collaboration. The Alibaba Group can bring its own proven technologies and utilize these capabilities within this domain. Moreover, Alibaba is undeniably one of the biggest retailers in the world. Our experience in retail manufacturing and the internet allow us to approach the Middle East from a favorable standpoint. Consequently, these experiences have shown us that by partnering locally, we can localize packages for local customers.</p><p><strong>What would you like to see happen in the region from a policy perspective, and how do you see your business developing in the next five years?</strong><br>From a policy perspective, we have observed positive changes and a receptive business environment. We would like to see these positive adjustments across the ecosystem continue. Interestingly, we launched a joint lab with Khalifa University to nurture talent and enable innovation. Furthermore, we also launched the first clean energy-AI cooperation lab in 2018. Our research has also given us the opportunity to contribute academically to the study of geographic conditions for oil and gas. The traditional approach to the cloud is working with internet and data companies. However, we have seen with cloud computing and big data that technology should be more inclusive. It should be applicable to traditional industries, like oil and gas, manufacturing, and retail. Right now, our strategy is heavily focused on internationalization efforts. We are also deepening our presence across the African continent. Our operations in Africa allow us to provide local training and inhouse-certified programs in many nations in Africa. Over the next five years, we anticipate having a sustainable and thriving business across both the Middle East and Africa. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[securing-the-perimeter]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How was the idea to form TIP conceived?<br></strong>TIP is a defense industry hub created by the Tawazun Economic Council, which is the entity charged with developing the UAE's defense sector. The initial idea was to establish a center for defense and security manufacturing that would provide the sector with its specific needs in a single location. This led to TIP's official establishment in 2012. The plan was to create a safe and secure dedicated zone with specialized infrastructure for the ammunition industry in Abu Dhabi. Our location is somewhat remote, to strategically suit the purpose of our inception, and yet perfectly connected to all the Emirates, various ports, airports, and highways. TIP is only a few kilometers away from Abu Dhabi Airport and close to the Khalifa Industrial Zone Abu Dhabi (KIZAD) and Jebel Ali Free Zone (JAFZA), giving us the advantage of operating safely and securely without losing our local, regional, or international attraction.</p><p><strong>Why are specialized industrial parks like TIP particularly advantageous for the defense sector?<br></strong>Defense and security are highly specialized business sectors that require a correspondingly specialized infrastructure for which safety and security are paramount. Security is layered and varies as per the respective zone within a secure CCTV perimeter. Although we lack any comparison, the advantage of a regional hub like TIP is that it provides a secure single-window platform for investors in the defense and security industries. Our most defining and distinguishing feature is our ammunition zone where all our facilities, be it storage or assembly, are constructed and governed by the standards laid out in the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines (IATG). This makes us uniquely equipped in the country to handle operations related to explosive materials with the highest safety levels. Other than dedicated infrastructure and specialized real estate, we provide services such as facilities management, project construction management, telecommunication, public relations, and business development services to enhance and support our investor's operations. We have signed several MoUs and service agreements with government departments to offer their respective services on-site to enhance the ease of doing business for our tenants. Another distinguishing factor of TIP is its investor-centric relationship model that focuses on the investor's business plan. Our flexibility around tenants is another key strength.</p><p><strong>What role does TIP play in safeguarding the personal and corporate IP of its tenants?<br></strong>There are two considerations in protecting our investors' assets. The first is IT and IP security. In the last few years, we have worked closely with the UAE Signals Intelligence Agency to enhance our IT security to ensure that data is protected with the highest level of security. The second consideration is physical security. This also extends to both the investors' personnel and material. TIP has a single point of entry and exit. Everyone and everything going in and out is recorded and scanned. CCTV monitors all common areas, and only relevant production staff is allowed into Zone 1 facilities. Everyone who works here goes through a security check before being allowed access to the park.</p><p><strong>How do you envision TIP evolving over the next five to 10 years?<br></strong>In 2013, our infrastructure was not complete, and the utilization of the area was low. We have grown 800% since then and yet stand at about 23% of land utilization. We still have a tremendous room for expansion. We are also grateful to the UAE's leadership for the steps it has taken to enhance FDI, through the Tawazun Economic Council and other entities. This opens the door for more strategic ownership and investments over the next few years. Our platform is ready, and the signs we see indicate growth. Considering our current rate of growth, we might even double our size within five to seven years. In 2019, the Tawazun Economic Council announced the Defense and Security Development Fund, and TIP is working with the fund to provide incentives for SMEs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Rabdan placed in the education ecosystem and what factors shape the design of your curriculum?<br></strong>Rabdan Academy is a government entity and its founding decree allows considerable flexibility for it to work across the Abu Dhabi, federal, private, and international markets, under the direction of a board of trustees comprising senior leaders from our major stakeholders. The academy is now over five years old, with major stakeholders in safety, security, defense, emergency management, and crisis response (SSDEC), such as the Armed Forces GHQ, Abu Dhabi Police, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the National Security Council, amongst others. The academy acts as a catalyst to build and develop interoperability between relevant entities, based upon education and training programs, which aim to make the SSDEC sector more effective. The academy is also working with stakeholders to identify common standards and doctrine, and how these can be aligned for organizational interoperability. This should result in better coordination of training, which improves operational performance whilst resulting in clear financial benefits. The added benefit of coherence in the education and training system, such as agreed national standards, is that this enables nationally recognized skills certification, which ultimately creates a more employable and portable workforce. In addition to academic programs, the academy has also been making significant progress in the development and delivery of short courses and vocational training over the past few years. Moreover, we are working to provide more flexible pathways to education, including recognition of prior learning, suitable for future requirements and in alignment with relevant regulations, so that we can contribute to a highly skilled workforce that is prepared for future challenges. As the academy grows, we are also increasingly looking internationally to develop partnerships with top universities. </p><p><strong>How does technology affect curriculum design and how can technology be a utility to build transferable skills?<br></strong>Technology has a significant impact on curriculum design, as the SSDEC sector is moving fast across the spectrum of new scientific developments. In particular, everyone is talking about AI. With such fast technological developments, it is not easy for organizations to predict what skillsets they will need from employees six years from now, so this presents a significant challenge when designing a curriculum. However, I would contend that fundamental human skills, such as critical thinking and leadership, are going to be just as important, if not more, as AI enters the workplace. Our graduates will need to be able to do the things that AI cannot or should not do, such as showing curiosity, creativity and innovation, ethical thinking, and other human abilities that are hard to program into computers.</p><p><strong>What are your expectations and outlook for the year ahead?<br></strong>We held our first graduation ceremony in October 2018, so we are proud that our graduates will be using the skills they have learned at Rabdan Academy to make the UAE a safer and more secure place. We will be launching our new master's program in policing and security leadership. We are also seeking to expand internationally, building on our reputation for maintaining the highest standards and seeking the best possible educational outcomes for our students. We will be offering a wider range of vocational training courses to our stakeholders and also developing the centers of excellence project to enhance interoperability and effective, efficient training regimes. We are in the process of developing plans for a new simulation center, which we hope to have approved and building started in 2019. Moreover, we will continue to build our research capabilities. Rabdan Academy's reputation will continue to grow throughout 2019, and our alumni will be recognized for their achievement and contribution toward a more resilient nation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is KIZAD's role in the diversification of Abu Dhabi's economy?<br></strong>KIZAD plays an integral role in the realization of Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030. As a master developer, we have created an integrated trade, logistics, and industrial hub for the Emirate, helping it move away from hydrocarbon dependence to a strong, sustainable economy. By investing in infrastructure, technology and innovation, and local and international talent, KIZAD is helping drive diversification. At present, KIZAD and Abu Dhabi Ports together contribute 3.6% (AED19.6 billion) to Abu Dhabi's non-oil GDP, and by 2030, we plan to boost our contribution to 15%. Already, more than 400 companies have committed investment to KIZAD, which is a remarkable achievement in such a short space of time. Equally impressive is the diverse range of industries we have attracted, from automotive and metals to polymers, food and beverage, and oil and gas. There are many reasons for this, such as our strategic location between Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Khalifa Port, and innovative and flexible infrastructure that has been built for expansion. One of the biggest factors behind our success has been understanding the needs of each individual client, and then going above and beyond to ensure we deliver what matters to their business the most.</p><p><strong>What industrial sectors does KIZAD focus on?<br></strong>As per Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, KIZAD targets nine areas of industry, of which seven form our immediate focus. The first five are polymers, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, food, oil and gas, and automotive. The other two, logistics and utilities, support these industries.<br>One of the elements that is attractive to these industries at KIZAD is how the zone is made up of multiple industrial clusters. We allocate land by grouping certain industries and service providers together. As a result, firms can create value by leveraging our anchor tenants and facilitating synergies and operational efficiencies.</p><p><strong>How has KIZAD become financially sustainable?<br></strong>I have seen many zones around the world that are announced with a big fanfare. However, the majority fail, largely because they are subsidized to a level where they never learn to stand on their own feet. At KIZAD and Abu Dhabi Ports, we are not only operationally independent from the government, but financially independent as well. Four years after attaining financial independence, we have become a highly profitable business. However, we aren't complacent and will continue to exercise prudence in how we expand. One of the reasons behind our success is that we target customers who are sustainable and able to serve the market. We want those who can stand on their own feet and deliver value to the economy. Equally significant, KIZAD, with its road, sea, air and future rail connectivity to the UAE and GCC region, provides an excellent base for manufacturing, trading, and logistics industries. Unlike other industrial, logistics, and manufacturing zones, KIZAD is not hindered by urban congestion or ageing infrastructure—its offers superior multimodal connectivity via its road networks and highways, Khalifa Port, and four nearby international airports. We have both a strong offer and a sustainable strategy.</p><p><strong>How does KIZAD encourage innovation in Abu Dhabi's industrial sector?<br></strong>Innovation is at the core of everything we do, and we are constantly assessing ways to harness emerging technologies and trends to improve our processes and operations so our clients can improve their efficiency in turn. As a zone development and management organization, we have always focused on how small innovative ideas in infrastructure and services can positively impact our customers. One example is the Hot Metal Road, a specially constructed route that enables cost effective and energy efficient transport and delivery of molten aluminium. We have also specifically designed and built a sea water cooling and desalination system to ensure water returning to the sea causes no harm to marine life. We are confident that within the next 10 to 15 years, KIZAD will become the most vibrant industrial hub in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abu Dhabi has been ranked the safest city in the world for four years in a row by Numbeo. What policing measures have had the most immediate impact in reducing Abu Dhabi's crime index?</strong><br>Abu Dhabi being named as one of the safest cities in the world for the fourth year running by Numbeo is confirmation that the citizens and residents who live here and visitors that travel to the Emirate of Abu Dhabi are blessed to have a high level of personal security and safety. This accomplishment can be credited to the unlimited support and care that is extended by our visionary leaders, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, and His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi and the Deputy Supreme Commander of the UAE Armed Forces. It is not by chance that Abu Dhabi, and the UAE in general, has become an oasis of stability and safety. Our leadership prioritizes the promotion of peace and safety as two fundamental pillars in society and provides all the necessary resources to achieve these goals. As a result, our community is exceptionally safe and this has been increasingly acknowledged internationally, for example by Numbeo, which ranks Abu Dhabi as the city with the highest safety index of 88.67 and the lowest crime index of just 11.33. To maintain safety, Abu Dhabi Police continues to implement a comprehensive strategy and embrace initiatives that represent important achievements in the field of policing. These gains are important for community safety and contribute to the on-going story of the country as it continues to provide an attractive environment for citizens, residents and visitors to enjoy peace, well-being and an excellent quality of living. Central to our approach is the community-oriented policing and outreach initiatives that positively enhance our interaction with the community and helps to reinforce the publics sense of safety.</p><p><strong>What are some of the best current global policing practices, and how is the Abu Dhabi police incorporating these into local policing?</strong><br>Abu Dhabi Police constantly benchmarks itself against other police agencies and units across the world. Knowledge- sharing with global police and security bodies is also a key component of our development that enhances our ability to maintain, and improve on, best international practices in policing and crime prevention. The ongoing evolution of our security systems across the various sectors of the police, for example, is a reflection of the desire to benefit from our international interaction in order to enhance performance.</p><p><strong>Cyber crime is a significant threat across the globe. What are some of the strategies the Abu Dhabi Police is deploying to combat this?</strong><br>Highly trained and equipped staff that are well educated on the legal procedures surrounding cyber crime are a key layer in our ability to confront this challenge. The need to raise awareness on the dangers of cyber crime is also met by Abu Dhabi Police through the undertaking of campaigns, programs, forums, and participation in seminars on the best ways to fight this menace.</p><p><strong>What is the perspective of Abu Dhabi's law enforcement on the best ways to leverage innovative technologies?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi Police aims to promote employee creativity in all areas, which has led to the implementation of many innovations. For example, during the UAE Month of Innovation 2019, Abu Dhabi Police introduced a smart quad bike to its range of patrol vehicles. The specially adapted quad bike enhances our ability to patrol over rough terrain and access remote areas. It is equipped with a smart camera installed to capture, update, and store information. The bike efficiently performs all the functions of a traditional patrol vehicle but carries out the multiple tasks in a one-step process. Officers are specially trained to operate the smart bikes while the high-tech system enables the officers to respond to all types of emergencies and security situations across all terrain and locations. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>What are the most impactful ways in which the Department of Health drove its structural reforms and policies around the national vision?<br></strong>DoH has strategised six key pillars that underpin its goal of improving the well-being of Abu Dhabi residents through prevention as well as access to integrated, innovative, high-quality, and cost-effective healthcare. Quality remains at the forefront of DoH's priorities as it strives to continue enhancing the calibre of services whilst providing a safe and exceptional overall patient experience. In addition, DoH continues to work toward ensuring the delivery of comprehensive, continuous, and timely healthcare services to citizens and residents. As the healthcare regulator in the Emirate, DoH has developed a stringent set of policies and operational guidelines aimed at ensuring operational efficiency and boosting healthcare research. This is one of the most impactful ways in which DoH drove its structural reforms and policies around the UAE Government Vision 21. </p><p><strong>What are the distinguishing features of care offered in Abu Dhabi, and how does it synergize with the national offering?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi plays a chief role in the national healthcare landscape by bringing more investments and attracting key players in the industry to the region and the Emirate in particular. Abu Dhabi has also taken important strides in promoting innovation and digital health and offers distinguishing features of care including health data analytics, health information exchange, patient empowerment using mobility platforms, and telemedicine. DoH is intent on harnessing the power of technology to serve the healthcare industry, through investing in integrated health information systems to improve the overall quality of care and ensure patients' health and safety in the Emirate. DoH continues to work in line with the UAE Ministry of Health and Prevention and has integrated its efforts to provide exemplary medical services to ensure meeting the UAE's key objectives and synergizing with the national offering. </p><p><strong>Abu Dhabi's medical sector is noteworthy for its international partnerships. What is the Department of Health's role in fostering these collaborations?</strong><br>DoH's Capacity Master Plan (CMP) plays a crucial role in fostering international partnerships with the department by attracting key players in the healthcare industry to the Emirate. Through CMP, DoH strives to spur investment opportunities for the continued development and expansion of the healthcare capacity and services provision. This is implemented chiefly to meet the growing demand for healthcare services in Abu Dhabi. A recent example was signing a joint venture with Mayo Clinic Hospital to operate Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, the largest and most advanced hospital in the UAE. DoH continuously strives to learn from global success stories and showcase its own experience with others to open gateways for cooperation between different sectors that ultimately serves to improve patients' experiences, fill the gaps of specialties needed, and identify ideal geographic medical requirements. </p><p><strong>What major innovations has the Department of Health sought to attract in order to advance Abu Dhabi's standard of care?<br></strong>DoH has launched a series of digital health driven initiatives set to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the healthcare sector. Some of these partnerships incorporated projects including: localized diabetes risk calculator and cardiovascular risk calculator. In addition, DoH has collaborated with Saal to implement AI to provide insights on competency, training gaps, up-coding, and other trends in the medical sector. Furthermore, DoH has collaborated with Etisalat for the development of a digital healthcare center to drive innovation in the areas of chronic disease management and digital health, in addition to the use of blockchain, AI technologies, and big data to enhance the sector's outputs and quality of services. DoH has also launched an AI Lab to foster a new culture of innovation and inspiring cross-industrial collaboration in the sector with the aim to develop healthcare solutions through emerging technologies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What was the process of developing a port community system (PCS) for Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>Maqta Gateway was established by Abu Dhabi Ports after it became clear that Abu Dhabi could benefit from an advanced PCS. To build such a system, we carried out extensive research and feasibility studies. We also brought in consultants to study Abu Dhabi's trade community's needs. Our research led us to review the use of PCS throughout the major ports in Asia and Europe. Interestingly, PCSs have been in use for around 30 years, so there was substantial precedent upon which to draw. In fact, our initial studies actually took longer to complete than the actual implementation of the software component of the PCS. When we decided on a model with which to proceed, it became apparent to us that our PCS was going to be one of the biggest on record. Typically, most PCSs concentrate on the type of transport—for example, seagoing containerized cargo. Our PCS design is bigger in scope because we decided to cover sea, land, and air transport, and industrial zones and free zones. This allowed us to provide end-to-end visibility. Early in the design phase, it became apparent that we needed to follow international standards as closely as possible, and we consulted our stakeholders and customers throughout the process. Consequently, as of 2018, 80% of customer suggestions we gathered have been implemented. Ultimately, our overarching goal is to bring more trade to Abu Dhabi, and I believe we are in the process of accomplishing this goal.</p><p><strong>Considering that many private companies use their own systems to coordinate with their shipping partners, how can a PCS ensure it remains the dominant arbiter in the marketplace?</strong><br>Maqta is not promoting PCS itself. We are promoting trade facilitation. To be successful in this endeavor, we must ensure that we are adaptable and that our service offering remains integrated. Our trade facilities are unique because of the level of engagement with government stakeholders. Having Maqta play a role of an intermediary enables private businesses to overcome obstacles. This is something that existing market players cannot provide. Interestingly, World Bank statistics showed between 11% and 15% of trade value is lost due to red tape. If you are a small customer and you want an interface application to access the PCS, we can provide it. If you are a big player and you need access to our PCS to exchange messages, we can oversee this integration as well.</p><p><strong>What drove the decision to develop your own proprietary blockchain, Silsal, and what are some of its unique offerings?<br></strong>The motivation to develop the Silsal blockchain technology was driven by trade needs. By listening to the needs of our trade community, we realized they had specific requirements with regards to markets, security, integration, and other matters. Having experience within this market allowed us to approach this technology from a favorable position. One of the areas that we chose to focus on first was digital identity. Blockchain, by design, is supposed to bring security to a network; however, by accessing a network simply with a password, you are not maximizing security. Therefore, our solution was to integrate digital identity with a smart contract system that can create customized rules and authorize temporary users. This solution, by itself, brings unprecedented level of security. It will be interesting to see where blockchain can take the blue economy in the coming years.</p><p><strong>What is the significance of your MoU with NYU Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>Maqta Gateway's MoU with NYU Abu Dhabi seeks to explore a wide range of technologies, including AI. The substance of the MoU fits within the broader context of delivering economic growth at the port across six strategic areas, one of which is applying new technology. We have already begun adopting our own machine learning technology, which will help standardize routine jobs that are time-intensive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is Elite Agro positioned within the UAE's emerging agricultural sector?<br></strong>Elite Agro was established in 2010 to further the food-security interests of the UAE. We consider ourselves an investment company with a particular focus on food security and sustainability. Starting mainly with forages in 2010, by 2013 we built our first greenhouses. Now we have four main farms in the UAE, and in addition to production we also engage in trading. Elite Agro's products are mainly among the high-demand vegetable market, including tomatoes, capsicum, eggplants, potatoes, figs, lettuce, legumes, melons, and squash. Beyond vegetables, we also produce other food items, such as honey, olive oil, and olives. Our agricultural operations are located in the UAE, where we are the biggest vegetable producers, and also overseas, in countries such as Serbia, Morocco, and Mauritania. Our strategic assets overseas have combined with our work here in the UAE to revolutionize the local industry. Market disruptions happen in agriculture, as they did in Thailand, India, and Pakistan. We want to ensure that if we face something similar here, our external suppliers are ready. Today, we export our products to most GCC countries. In 2018, we exported potatoes to Somalia through a UN program, and, for the first time, our branch in Mauritania exported blueberries to the UK. Every year, technology is becoming more efficient, and we are seeing higher and better results year on year at lower costs. Our main goal is to ensure that our customers are satisfied and supplied all-year round.</p><p><strong>What is the level of sophistication in the UAE agricultural sector, as seen through Elite Agro's work?<br></strong>The UAE's climate is extreme, reaching 50 degrees Celsius in the summer. Water scarcity is also a major issue. The ground water has high levels of salinity, so we must use technology to overcome this and also use desalinated seawater provided by the municipality. The soil is also poor. On top of this, the market itself is tough, with high competition. Survival is such a market is hard, considering all of these factors and the cost pressures and competition from regional neighbors, namely Iran, Oman, and Jordan. Elite Agro has experts from more than 25 nationalities. While it was not easy for many of them to acclimate to the specific conditions that we face in the UAE, their experience has allowed us to reach a level where we are competing with advanced agricultural economies. We also have a robust R&amp;D team, which has managed to create products that consumers can distinguish on the shelf by virtue of their taste and shelf life. Elite Agro has one of the best post-harvest systems in the UAE. We are one of the few to use immediate pre-cooling, which increases the shelf life. Our table tomato, for example, can last 18 days thanks to our post-harvest techniques. We use plastic with micro-holes, allowing the crops to breathe. There is a real science to getting all of this right, and it is reflected in Elite Agro's certification by GLOBAL G.A.P., an international assurance program for good agricultural practices.</p><p><strong>How does Elite Agro counter cost pressures and ensure the sustainability of its business model?<br></strong>There are four ways that Elite Agro works to maintain profitability: refining the efficiency of its processes, targeting the right markets, achieving economies of scale, and investing in R&amp;D. In terms of targeting the right market, our sales team works hard to open new markets and secure the best retailers, food processors, and wholesalers. In Abu Dhabi, the agricultural sector is comprised of 4,000 small farms scattered throughout the region. Our four large farms, however, enable us to reach economies of scale that offset our general overhead and administrative costs, which tend to be high in this business. Finally, in the area of R&amp;D, Elite Agro has made a mark on the local market by building greenhouses. Elite was the first company in the UAE to produce tomatoes and capsicum year-round. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the concept behind Catalyst, its core priorities, and some of its recent milestones?<br></strong>Catalyst is a start-up accelerator that was officially launched in 2017, but traces its roots back to 2014, when it was initiated by Dr. Sultan Al Jaber, who was then the CEO of Masdar. Abu Dhabi's leadership wants the Emirate to become a dominant global start-up and innovation ecosystem. At the time of inception, we had the plans and roadmap in place to be part of the Masdar ecosystem. When you look at this ecosystem, it had the Masdar Institute, which was located at the time in Masdar City before it merged with Khalifa University. Now, we have the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence. We aim to attract innovative game-changers that positively disrupt peoples' lifestyles with their inventions. In addition to this, the other criteria we apply is that the start-up must be sustainable and focused on some of the following pillars: clean technology, energy efficiency, energy storage, agriculture technologies, e-mobility, and food security. When Catalyst was established, we had three applicants that came directly from the Masdar Institute. One was De L'arta, a botanical science and chemistry-related start-up. They came with a business idea that flourished into two distinct concepts. We also have Solva, the first to introduce electric motorcycles for delivery purposes in the UAE market. The third is BonApp, which falls under the theme of food security since it helps locate food before its expiration date at discounted rates. They have their own systems and algorithms and are now developing smart tagging to obtain more data.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>How would you summarize the benefits that the Catalyst program offers to prospective start-ups, and what incentive programs do you have in place for eligible participants? </strong><br>We provide funding and mentorship to organizations that have the potential to commercialize their innovative ideas. Catalyst provides accommodation for international start-ups, office space, legal, HR, and ICT-related support and mentorship. We also aim to give commercial knowledge and open new markets for ideas. What's more, we don't just focus on the UAE; we think about how some of our participants can expand into overseas territories. Catalyst is an excellent proposition in terms of location; we are located next to Abu Dhabi airport as well as major ports and KIZAD. The city itself is only 25 minutes away. Abu Dhabi's free zones and e-government services make it convenient for investors to set-up businesses. Catalyst was formed to integrate these formalities for start-up pilots. We can conduct all the due diligence with the board, shareholders, and professional workforce. We then evaluate and value the company before deciding whether or not to support it. This method provides greater transparency for start-ups as it gives them a much clearer picture of how to become a formalized entity. 2020 represents an exciting time for start-ups, and we are expecting Expo 2020 to be an interesting game changer for the region. </p><p><strong>Is there a perception among investors or the business community that clean technology solutions are not a good financial investment?</strong><br>This is a perception that has changed throughout the investment community over the last decade. Many clean technological solutions have proven to be a good bet for investors. What's more, with the utilization of data and other disruptive technologies converging, there is more openness from many traditional sectors about exploring, deploying, and investing in these. When we look at clean technology, the investments may not be tangible today; indirectly, however, they can create economic, environmental, or social benefits. Every start-up is a different case study. We look for unicorns, and two or three of ours will be unicorns since they are patent-generating companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How does Tamouh position itself in the UAE's property market?<br></strong>Tamouh owns around 60% of Reem Island in Abu Dhabi, whilst also maintaining a large amount of land in Al Ain. What differentiates us is our work on Reem Island. We began with Marina Square, which comprises of 14 buildings, a mall, hotel, and serviced apartments. The beauty of Marina Square is that it is located just outside of downtown Abu Dhabi. We delivered Marina Square in 2011, and it was later sold to a sub-developer. From there, we moved on to the City of Lights, where we developed six buildings, all of which were handed over in 2014. In addition, we also sell plots and buildings as part of our business strategy.</p><p><strong>What does the concept of happy living mean to Tamouh?<br></strong>When you are living in an apartment, you want all your amenities within easy reach. This is why we have focused on building communities that have all the necessary amenities for tenants and occupants to enjoy. These include—but are not limited to—walking tracks, retail centers, gyms, swimming pools, and mosques. There is a diverse range of nationalities, including Emirati nationals, who call our projects home. All this adds a rich cultural vibrancy to our communities.</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through some of the unique payment plans Tamouh has in place?<br></strong>Our aim is to be flexible. When the market goes down, we have to move with it. Some investors will be hesitant to sell when the market goes down. Recently, we rolled out a payment plan called "post-handover" for Horizon Towers. Horizon Towers is the only project with a five-year payment plan that allows clients to move in right away. This is done to satisfy the requirements of investors as well as the market. I believe flexible payment plans will become more widespread, and we will see more developers following such sales tactics. </p><p><strong>How do you expect the Ghadan 21 initiative to effect Tamouh's operations and developments?<br></strong>Ghadan aims to make the real estate sector more attractive in Abu Dhabi. The government has recently changed regulations to allow for titles to be transferred to foreigners. This is one factor that will help stimulate the economy. </p><p><strong>Are you utilizing any disruptive technologies?<br></strong>We always seek to upgrade our systems in-line with the market to enhance productivity and efficiency. We are also exploring some new technologies with the architects that we work with. Consider precast, an old technology that is taking on new processes. By using new technologies, precast parts can be built much faster, which ultimately helps the government build housing more efficiently.</p><p><strong>How do you scale projects while maintaining family aspects of Emirati life?<br></strong>For one of our major projects in Jebel Hafeet that comprises of 3,000 homes, we were conscious of building in such a way that would foster social interaction and build a real sense of community. This development is a fully fledged community that includes schools, mosques, retail centers, and a health center. Over the next five to seven years, our biggest market will be focused on Emirati housing as the population is growing, and the government is supporting projects of this kind. We are in communication with the housing authority, advising on how regulations can be changed or eased, in order to reach a level of harmony between the public and private sectors.</p><p><strong>What can be done to increase investor sentiment and revitalize the construction industry?<br></strong>It is paramount that the government is part of the solution. When the economy goes down, we must react and reduce prices. When the market goes up, we can look to increase prices, proportionately. This will cover losses when the economy goes down—adaptation is where we find strength. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Aldar position itself in the UAE's property development market?<br></strong>Aldar is the leading real estate asset investor, manager, and developer in Abu Dhabi with USD10 billion in assets and a 75-million sqm land bank. Our approach focuses on delivering operational excellence while creating value for our customers by offering exceptional and memorable experiences and outperforming their expectations. We regularly assess the supply and demand dynamics in the market in order to bring the right product at the right time and optimize our land bank. We are committed to driving long-term sustainable growth in everything we do, for our people, in the Emirate and beyond. So far, 2019 has been a remarkable year for Aldar, with strong operational and financial performance. We launched four land plot development projects—Areeman, Alreeman II, Lea, and Saadiyat Reserve—which have all almost sold out within their first weeks on the market. We were also awarded AED5 billion projects by the Abu Dhabi government that are expected to bring immediate and long-term commercial and socioeconomic value to both the capital and Aldar. We expanded our presence to Dubai, where we inaugurated our sales and experience center, which is aimed at boosting our international sales and outreach.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead, where do you see Ghadan 21 stimulus initiatives having the most significant impact on the property sector in the medium to long term?</strong><br>We are firm supporters of our leadership's vision for Abu Dhabi and have entered into a number of strategic partnerships under various pillars of the Ghadan 21 program. We recently partnered with the Department of Urban Planning and Municipalities and Abu Dhabi Digital Authority to launch 'Buy a home' Tamm Journey to provide customers with a diverse range of hassle-free services related to purchasing a home. We are also contributing to the promotion of private-public partnerships (PPPs) in the education industry, working closely with public academic institutions to provide world-class education in line with international standards. On the innovation front, Aldar, along with other leading Abu Dhabi entities, has pledged support for Hub71's MENA Growth competition, an initiative of MIT Enterprise Forum Pan Arab. In the medium term, we expect the introduction of new business licenses and ease of doing business initiatives to attract more companies and investors to Abu Dhabi, in turn increasing demand for both commercial and residential space and stimulating the real estate sector. Looking ahead, we expect this AED50-billion accelerator program to ultimately boost investment and innovation, create jobs, and improve the overall quality of life in the Emirate.</p><p><strong>What opportunities does the Abu Dhabi real estate market offer overseas buyers and investors?<br></strong>The new residency laws and simplified process for foreigners to own property are game changers that will further enhance Abu Dhabi's reputation as an attractive destination to live and do business. These new regulations are set to attract overseas buyers to invest in some of the Emirate's most promising residential and commercial projects. Our positive results in the first six months of 2019—which demonstrated continued profit growth—are a reflection of the positive impact of these initiatives and the strong fundamentals of both the sector and our business. We see growing interest from international buyers and investors, and, as such, our strategy is focused on leveraging our success globally and unlocking unrealized potential.</p><p><strong>What was the thinking behind the recent restructuring of Khidmah and the establishment of Provis?<br></strong>Aldar places customers at the heart of everything it does, and enhancing their experience in every interaction with us is key. As such, the decision to establish Provis, an entity to deliver market-leading, innovative estate management solutions to clients across the UAE, is perfectly aligned with our mission to create exceptional and memorable experiences for our customers. It allows us to offer our customers a more streamlined, integrated, and efficient service and apply innovative solutions and cutting-edge technology to add tangible value to properties at every stage of the property life cycle. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does ADHA work to fulfill the housing needs of Abu Dhabi citizens?<br></strong>The development and identification of housing needs is driven by a number of factors, with the supply and demand analysis being one of the key inputs in this process. The supply and demand analysis enable ADHA to plan the budgets for the various types of benefits that it provides to the public. This process involves coordinating efforts with various strategic partners such as Musanada and the Department of Municipalities and Transport.</p><p><strong>Delivering sustainability across the built environment is a major priority of the government. Can you walk us through the sustainability agenda of ADHA?</strong><br>ADHA has already developed housing guidelines to be followed by its strategic partners, and sustainability is one of the key aspects under these guidelines. As an example, we have even reviewed guidelines for plot sizes in order to secure land for future generations. Another example relates to housing loans, where we have improved the collection of mortgage payments, which in turn has enhanced the sustainability of the funds required for future loan issuances.</p><p><strong>In urban planning, there is a strong emphasis on creating communities that enable social cohesion. How does this factor into your strategic planning objectives?</strong><br>A key element of ADHA's strategic objectives and map is the creation of social cohesion among Emirati housing communities. Strengthening social cohesion through connected housing community will strengthen future Emirati generations and further enhance social and economic stability. This in turn will enable individuals to focus on becoming effective and contribute to the continuous development of the country.</p><p><strong>Abu Dhabi has unique cultural traditions. How do demands in housing differ based on such factors?<br></strong>The Emirati society has deep and historic traditions and traits, and it shares a number of common cultural and traditional characteristics when it comes to housing requirements. From our experience, at present, individuals in Abu Dhabi prefer to live close to work and the city. As a result, they are more willing to let go of other elements on their wish list such as bigger spaces.</p><p><strong>What technologies have benefited ADHA the most in regards to helping it deliver its mandate?<br></strong>The infrastructure implemented by ADSIC has paved the road for ADHA to become a pioneer in utilizing technology to connect through web interfaces with 20-plus entities. This has transformed the customer experience significantly as now clients only need their Emirate ID to apply for a housing benefit. Another key example of how ADHA leverages technology is the new system that allows UAE nationals to apply for housing benefits from anywhere. As for Bayti initiative, the reception has been great, especially when considering that this initiative not only provides applicants with options of several different home designs but also paves the way for future cost savings.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead, what future development plans does ADHA have in store over the next five years, and how will you expand your customer service offering?</strong><br>We are always looking to find new ways to serve our customers better and achieve the highest level of customer satisfaction. One of the key things we are focusing on is how we can reduce the time it takes for our valued clients to receive the housing benefits they applied for and eventually settle in their dream homes. Our housing policies are being constantly reviewed based on various factors including the government's plans, customers' feedback, and the challenges they face with current housing policies. This, in turn, enables us to constantly improve our policies as well as introduce new offerings. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been your main accomplishments and milestones in the last 12 months? <br></strong>The past 12 months have been transformational for Abu Dhabi Ports as it continues to roll out its long-term growth strategy. In December 2018, we inaugurated CSP Abu Dhabi Terminal, a semi-automated, deepwater container terminal at Khalifa Port, operated by COSCO SHIPPING Ports (CSP), under a concession agreement for 35 years. After only one year in operation, the terminal has shifted from its trial operation phase to being fully operational, which is a great achievement indeed. In fact, it has moved over 400,000 TEUs in seven months. CSP Abu Dhabi Terminal includes the largest container freight station in the Middle East and connects Abu Dhabi to CSP's global portfolio of 37 ports. Total CAPEX spent on CSP Abu Dhabi Terminal is approximately USD300 million. We also announced a major AED4-billion expansion at Khalifa Port, which includes the development of a new South Quay and Khalifa Port Logistics, alongside an expansion of Abu Dhabi Terminals (ADT). We have gone from strength to strength across all our assets in 2019. Notably, as of November 2019, we handled over 20 million tons of general cargo across all ports, surpassing the 19.7 million tons we handled in 2018. Over the same period, Khalifa Port handled 2.5 million TEUs, a significant increase over the 1.7 million TEUs the port handled in 2018. It was also an exciting year for our maritime technology business, Maqta Gateway. The subsidiary was founded to make trade processes simpler and more efficient through digital solutions, and plays a central role in driving Abu Dhabi Ports' technology partnerships and investments. Maqta Gateway has also been testing an international blockchain solution with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company called SILSAL, which aims to provide a seamless and secure link between stakeholders across the trading community. Finally, earlier in 2019, we were pleased to be recognized for our investment in our people, when we became the first organization in the Middle East to receive the IIP Platinum Accreditation, the highest accolade attainable through Investors in People (IIP), an international standard for people management. We are proud to be recognized for having a supportive working environment where employees are seen as a catalyst for innovation and profitability.</p><p><strong>Can you walk us through Abu Dhabi Ports' strategy for increasing its connectivity with other international ports and maritime hubs?</strong> <br>Our global strategy focuses on the following three key priorities: securing partnerships with some of the world's largest shipping companies and port operators; expanding capacity and interconnectivity between our facilities through investments in infrastructure; and investing in the latest technology to better connect with partner entities and customers. For example, in addition to the long-term concession agreements with ADT, CSP, MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, and Autoterminal Barcelona, we have a 35-year concession agreement to operate the Fujairah Port through which we are investing more than AED1 billion on the rejuvenation of the port's infrastructure. Our concession model provides an opportunity to establish and operate regional hubs to transport goods from Asia through to Africa and Europe and back, and along the Belt and Road maritime route. Abu Dhabi Ports is an ideal partner for this purpose, offering investors unprecedented access to local and global markets through advanced transport connectivity, an ecosystem that is backed by purpose-built infrastructure, efficient investor support services, and low operational costs. In return, our partners connect Abu Dhabi to an ever-growing international network of ports across China, Southeast Asia, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. This global network feeds directly into KIZAD, which has already attracted more than 500 investors and more than AED70 billion in investment across multiple sectors. We're looking to sustain this upward trajectory with ongoing infrastructure investment. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What institutional changes and added administrative and governance value has the consolidation of the Urban Planning Council, Department of Transport, and the Department of Municipal Affairs to become DMT brought to Abu Dhabi's residents?<br></strong>The consolidation has brought together all urban planning functions across the Emirate into a single administrative structure. This has aligned the DMT's strategic planning and the Emirate's overall vision with the daily operational functions of the municipalities and transport sector, creating more comprehensive urban planning, transport, and municipal services across the Emirate and enhancing the governance value enjoyed by Abu Dhabi residents. These changes have resulted in an improved and more streamlined approach to urban planning matters across the Emirate. The outcome of this approach, coupled with integration of key support functions, such as IT and GIS, have further improved the outcomes of urban planning and the quality of service provided to residents of Abu Dhabi.</p><p><strong>What processes drive the development of DMT's environmental and sustainability agenda, both in terms of thought leadership and consultative processes?</strong><br>As the entity responsible for supporting the growth and sustainable urban development of Abu Dhabi, DMT is continuing its forward-looking, modern, innovative, and cutting-edge approach to urban planning that has evolved successfully across the Emirate over the past 10-15 years. DMT continues to participate in global discussions on the latest solutions and approaches to urban planning, municipal modernization, and transport, while fostering new relationships and working with countries and governments across the globe that are also recognized leaders in this field. In February 2020, DMT will host the World Urban Forum in Abu Dhabi. This will be the first time an Arab country will host such a prestigious event and further recognizes the position of Abu Dhabi as a leading advocate for appropriate urban planning solutions. Closer to home, DMT's award-winning Estidama program, for sustainability within the building and development process across the Emirate, continues to be a leader in its field and recently picked up more awards for its training and development programs.</p><p><strong>How is feedback and day-to-day experience of ordinary residents incorporated into municipal policy?<br></strong>The urban governance model in Abu Dhabi has been evolving and developing rapidly in recent years. The evolution of IT systems and development of apps, as well as successfully completing our digital transformation program, have allowed DMT to develop many more tailored online services, which provide quicker, clearer, and accurate development information to residents, in accordance with the governance model. Many of DMT's recent policy approaches have been developed following specific feedback from residents and the wider community. DMT continually works with the community to enhance the level of urban planning services, according to the needs of residents across the Emirate. One example has been the successful launch of the My Land app, which provides accurate and up-to-date information to residents, on their plots within the city. This also aligns with one of DMT's core strategic objectives to increase customer happiness.</p><p><strong>How does DMT ensure that the urban evolution of Abu Dhabi aligns with the realities of the global economy while also being mindful of preserving the Emirate's unique cultural heritage?</strong><br>DMT maintains its understanding of the latest urban planning thinking, solutions, and practices, whilst also taking into consideration the wider financial and economic circumstances in the region and world. Abu Dhabi—and indeed the UAE—are uniquely placed to adapt quickly to any changes in the global economy, given the intuitive and innovational approach of its leadership. Abu Dhabi has, over the years, built up an impressive data resource of knowledge for all the natural and cultural assets. This resource, with the ever-developing regulatory framework being advanced by DMT, will result in greater awareness of these assets and help to direct projects to the appropriate locations within the Emirate, whilst conserving and preserving the rich and unique cultural heritage of Abu Dhabi. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is Siemen's position in the UAE's industrial landscape, and how does the organization leverage on its global resources to create specific offerings for the region?<br></strong>The UAE and the Middle East are important markets for Siemens, and our operations in this region are well established. The UAE has experienced rapid transformation across many sectors of the economy, to which Siemens' operations are very much aligned. Siemens is a leader in digitalization, with vast experience bringing new technologies to markets and applying them across a range of sectors. Our MindSphere platform, for example, is a cloud-based, open IoT operating system that allows users from a number of sectors to improve their operations through access to data and advanced analytics. We have three MindSphere Application Centers in the UAE and are working with a diverse spectrum of clients from the oil and gas, logistics, and industrial sectors. Representatives from Siemens work directly with specific industries, which helps create an element of co-creation. We aim to develop these solutions together with the industries that we serve. This is another part of our transformation journey in which we are part of the UAE's transition from hydrocarbons to a knowledge-based economy.</p><p><strong>Which of Siemens' business lines in the region exhibits the greatest potential?<br></strong>The region is still heavily dominated by energy, although we are seeing a shift from hydrocarbons to renewables. Siemens has been engaged with tenders for renewables plants across the UAE. The sustainability agenda is something that Siemens actively complements, and this is further supported by the technologies that we can implement. Naturally, we have a wide range of offerings within our traditional hydrocarbon business unit; however, we are also expanding our offerings within the area of renewables. For example, our H-class and HL-class turbines have up to 64% efficiency, which allows resources to be utilized in a more intelligent way. Across other sectors of the economy, there is also a desire to be more sustainable. Moreover, across many buildings in the UAE, we see the desire to drive efficiencies. This is an area where Siemens technologies can be applied, in particular its smart infrastructure solutions. Energy efficiency and building control are two important growth markets. In the larger picture, we are building a blueprint for the smart city for Expo 2020. This is the first cloud-operated city that has ever been built. I am also optimistic that many more technologies will emerge after the Expo concludes.</p><p><strong>Abu Dhabi has signaled a clear intention to boost renewable technologies. What might the renewable energy mix will look like over the next decade as this takes shape? </strong><br>Around 50% will remain fossil, but there will be a growth in alternative energy and renewables such as solar. For this shift to happen, the entire grid system needs to be ready. More importantly, power plants need to operate in an efficient manner. The more we use solar, the more fluctuations in power generation there will be. Therefore, grid management is extremely important. Management can be rather complex, which is why Siemens has devised smart solutions that allow for better integration and management. Storage will also play an increasingly integral role. Interestingly, one mechanism to store energy is hydrogen, and this is something we are piloting at Dubai Expo. We generate surplus energy from solar and generate hydrogen, as it can then be used in different applications. Synthetic fuels are another area where this region can play a pivotal role. There are obvious advantages when we look at electric cars, though they have many problems related to storage and batteries. Synthetic fuels provide an alternative. There is a huge benefit for today's economy if one continues with hydrogen, which gives us another way to handle it in the future. That is a renewable technology that is simultaneously a storage technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Would you provide an overview of TAQA and how it has formulated its investment strategy in both the domestic and international markets?<br></strong>TAQA was established in 2005, and today we operate and invest in 11 countries covering power generation, water desalination, oil and gas exploration and production, pipelines, and gas storage. Our focus has always been to optimize operations while maintaining strict standards for health and safety. We aim to achieve long-term sustainable growth and continue to maximize our existing asset base. In the power and water sectors, we are amongst the best-performing companies wherever we operate; in the UAE, our assets' availability and performance places us in the top quartile of the industry. TAQA has played a role in several milestone power projects in Africa, expanding the Jorf Lasfar coal-fired power generation plant in Morocco to have a total plant capacity of 2,056MW, in addition to a 330MW combined cycle power plant in Ghana. Similarly, in the hydrocarbon sector, we have developed a significant project in Iraqi Kurdistan and the second-largest gas storage facility in the Netherlands. </p><p><strong>What synergies have you created between TAQA's global investments, and how can that knowledge transfer generate benefits for Abu Dhabi and the UAE?</strong><br>TAQA has a successful record of infusing its strengths across various global business units. For example, we established TAQA Europe to create synergies between our operations in the UK and the Netherlands. We have adopted the same strategy in Africa, where we created TAQA Africa, which oversees our businesses in Morocco and Ghana. Collaboration between operations is essential to the company's continued success. We also have special forums where our staff from different business units, such as health and safety, get together to share experience and knowledge about the latest industry trends. In addition, we have monthly “Train Your Brain" workshops that include a department presenting something new to employees while explaining their individual roles. It helps build bridges among our staff while also highlighting the important role that every person plays at TAQA. As a multinational and operator across global markets, we are well-positioned to leverage the capabilities and expertise we gain in-country as well as abroad. </p><p><strong>What is the strategic importance of TAQA's water and electricity assets in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>The UAE represents the majority of assets under our portfolio. Out of the 17,400MW that TAQA generates globally, more than 70% are produced in the UAE. Notably, our eight power plants in Abu Dhabi represent approximately 90% of Abu Dhabi's total power supply. We began in the UAE and continue to support the country and region. </p><p><strong>How do you tackle the integrity and life-cycle issues across your assets?<br></strong>TAQA is a global late-life asset operator with expertise in safely and efficiently managing these types of assets. In the North Sea, we have implemented numerous initiatives and have successfully extended the life of our assets by many years. Our core priorities at TAQA include the safety and wellbeing of our employees, portfolio optimization, and executing cost-effective decommissioning. We have been carrying out initiatives related to well plug and abandonment since 2017, which is the first step in the decommissioning process. That process will continue at a controlled pace in accordance with detailed plans.</p><p><strong>What are some of the most interesting and innovative technologies you are implementing in your day-to-day business?<br></strong>Like many of our peers, we are always scanning the horizon for technologies that will make our operations more efficient. This includes implementing the latest decommissioning technologies as well as using clean and alternative energies. Solar and wind energy as well as battery storage will be key areas for the future of the utilities sector, both internationally and in the UAE. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Bloom Holding position itself in the UAE property market?<br></strong>The first differentiating factor of Bloom is customer-centricity. Our mixed-use developments that span the real estate, hospitality, retail, education, and healthcare sectors resonate strongly with our customers in the UAE. The second element is that we are aligned with Abu Dhabi's vision. We always consider the long-term impact of what we do, and sustainability is the cornerstone of our business. The third component that makes us unique compared to other developers is that we have successfully bridged the Abu Dhabi and Dubai markets. This helps to open the UAE market more broadly.</p><p><strong>What are some of the ways that you are expanding and developing your service offerings?<br></strong>Many of the developments in Abu Dhabi are targeted at Emiratis, and it is essential to understand what this demographic wants. Attention must be paid to privacy, seclusion, peace, and the physical environment. Bloom Gardens has been a phenomenally successful development for us. We have the opportunity to initiate phase five and ensure the original vision for that development is magnified. Furthermore, we also have Brighton College Abu Dhabi as part of Bloom Gardens and the Mindchamps nursery. We provide communities with convenient amenities, and at Bloom Gardens, we will invest in the social and physical infrastructure, such as landscaping, community centers, and support services. The aim is to fine tune our offerings to different customer groupings.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us more about the Edition hotel, and where it is situated within Abu Dhabi's hospitality sector?<br></strong>Our two hotels are highly complementary in that both are part of the Marriott International chain. The Marriott Hotel Downtown is targeted at the business segment and The Edition at the leisure segment. Due to location, our corporate client base for The Edition is growing. Many corporate customers enjoy the food and beverage offering, and other income streams have also responded positively. It is crucial to get that balance right for The Edition. The president of The Edition in the US has expressed satisfaction in how we're developing the hotel and understands that the market here is different from London, Los Angeles, Miami, and New York City. The Edition won top positions in the What's On awards in 2019, which is encouraging for a hotel celebrating its first year.</p><p><strong>What are some of the innovative technologies that you have incorporated?<br></strong>Bloom Gardens was one the first unique communities on the main island, and this has been the case with Al Bateen and JVC. Technology is really important, especially when we consider facility management and optimization. This impacts the cost for both owners and tenants. The technology we adopt in buildings is proven and usually related to efficiencies such as water or lighting. At our new development, Bloom District, we are creating designs that utilize nature to create areas that are pleasant to live, work, and play in.</p><p><strong>How have government initiatives impacted your operations?<br></strong>The leadership is taking imaginative and creative steps to stimulate the market. The easing of visas and business set-up formalities is progressive, assisting both the public and private sectors. A part of Bloom's mission is to support and enable Abu Dhabi to achieve its long-term vision. Real estate is recognized as such an integral part of the economy that everyone wants the sector to succeed.</p><p><strong>What are the advantages of having a presence in both Abu Dhabi and Dubai?<br></strong>There are obvious benefits due to the diversity of the two markets. To engage in that diversity is a beneficial experience. We are anchored in both real estate and education, which provides growth opportunities. The UAE is an excellent place for Bloom to evolve, but we are also exploring opportunities abroad. What works in Abu Dhabi may not automatically work in Dubai, or vice versa. That being said, customer-centricity guides our approach to operating in both Emirates. The markets are also different in terms of what attracts people to them. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the role of IRENA and its mandate?<br></strong>IRENA is an international organization dedicated to renewable energy and sustainable solutions. It is the first of its kind and approaches renewable energy in a holistic manner. IRENA's mandate is to support its member states to develop effective policy frameworks through innovative strategies that encourage a greater uptake of renewable energies. Furthermore, IRENA gives guidance on sustainable technology as a substantial portion of IRENA's work covers the strategic advisory and technology domains. As an example, IRENA uses sophisticated technologies to map the renewable energy potential of individual countries. Along with policy support mechanisms and technical advisory, there are also financial assistance schemes. Many of the financial support programs come to fruition through IRENA's connecting different entities to each other, such as the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD), with government entities seeking to advance their renewable energy capacities though various financially assisted international renewable projects.</p><p><strong>What have been some of IRENA's recent achievements?<br></strong>2020 saw the 10th anniversary of IRENA General Assemblies held in Abu Dhabi. In that time, the organization has grown to hold more than 160 member states, while USD3 trillion has been invested in renewables since we held our first assembly in 2010. The progress made in this industry has been remarkable, and the UAE continues to play a vital role in IRENA's growth and mission.</p><p><strong>How does the UAE forward IRENA's agenda, and, conversely, how does the presence of IRENA help the UAE build its status as a renewable energy nation?</strong><br>The presence of IRENA in the UAE represents a global endorsement of our leading role in the push for a global energy transition. To host IRENA, we had to compete with Germany, Austria, and other countries that have a long history in renewables. Our achievement is a testament to how the UAE has gained global recognition within the clean energy domain. The entire region also benefits from hosting an international organization of this stature and sends a strong message that the pursuit of clean energy solutions should be a global effort. We all need to address climate change actively. The global appeal of hosting IRENA is also demonstrated by the fact that our international partnerships to date have fostered successful projects worldwide. We have concluded a USD50-million Pacific Partnership fund in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ADFD, and Masdar. At present, we are in the implementation phase of the USD50-million UAE-Caribbean Renewable Energy Fund (UAE-CREF). The IRENA—ADFD project facility, established in 2014, has now concluded seven cycles, with USD350 million allocated to date. As a result, 32 renewable energy projects in developing countries have received financing.</p><p><strong>How do you see energy trilemma, or the connection between energy, the environment, and the economy playing out over the next decade?</strong><br>We need energy, everywhere and at affordable prices, but it has to be generated in an environmentally friendly way with fewer carbon emissions. Nor do we want to be dependent on other countries to get our energy. This is the trilemma, and each country has to find the right balance to achieve this target. Renewable energy has the potential to solve many of the problems. It is more environmentally friendly and is growing increasingly affordable, not only on a large-scale level, but also for remote areas and islands. It also helps many countries grow less dependent on fossil fuel imports. However, we still have to find solutions to the intermittency of renewable energy—the wind is not always blowing, and the sun doesn't always shine, but energy is required 24/7. The near future will see more work in R&amp;D and investment to solve this problem and advance the way of storage, for example battery and grid management systems. New players will enter the market, and we might also see a shift in geopolitics triggered by the energy transition. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[resolving-the-energy-trilemma]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>The creation of DoE marked the decentralization of regulatory and service provision aspects of energy in the Emirate. Can you tell us about the vision behind this reform?</strong><br>The overall objective of the government of Abu Dhabi is to have a sustainable utilities and sanitation sector that ensures optimal usage of natural resources. The vision also issued Law No. 11 of 2018, which established DoE to focus on developing a strategy for the energy sector, issue policies, and regulate companies active in the energy space. As the energy and water sector's transition develops, a clear separation between the asset owner on the one hand and the policymaker and regulator on the other will ensure Abu Dhabi is able to balance the competing interests of the 'energy trilemma'—the security of energy and water supply, sustainability of the energy sector, and ensuring the lowest costs to end-consumers. Additionally, Abu Dhabi is introducing non-fossil fuel generation, decoupling desalination, and adopting new technologies. Alongside its regulatory responsibilities, DoE is creating new water and energy strategies and policies to deliver these outcomes.</p><p><strong>What role does DoE envision for PPPs in driving the development of the energy sector?<br></strong>The local energy market in Abu Dhabi is becoming increasingly complex as a result of factors like nuclear energy, renewables, and the decoupling of water co-generation entering the energy mix. Furthermore, private investors lay a great deal of emphasis on certainty, and DoE can play a pivotal role in creating a conducive environment for their investment. As the policymaker and regulator for the energy sector in the Emirate, DoE is responsible for fostering creativity and reducing risk. This is especially relevant in the area of clean and renewable energy, where there is little experience at the Emirate-level at the moment.</p><p><strong>What challenges will Abu Dhabi face in increasing the solar share in its energy mix?<br></strong>In most developed markets like Abu Dhabi's, the first wave of renewable capacity can be integrated into the wider system without difficulty, and this is what we have been seeing with the Sweihan PV independent power project. As the scale of PV rapidly increases; however, we will start to face new and interesting challenges. Solar PV, however, is only one part of a broader energy transition for Abu Dhabi. We have to position our targets and policies so as to remain agile, able to take advantage of innovations as they become viable, without locking ourselves into particular technologies in a way that we might come to regret in the future. We also anticipate new opportunities to manage demand. As smart devices and electric vehicles become mainstream, they could provide some of the flexibility services that we will need. Water will also become a form of virtual energy storage and demand-side management, as we shift production of desalinated water from new reverse-osmosis plants towards the middle of the day, when energy from PV is most abundant. So perhaps the challenge is not whether we can make the system flexible enough to accept much more PV, but rather finding a way to make all the parts work together efficiently.</p><p><strong>What does the DoE's new integrated energy model bring to Abu Dhabi's energy sector?<br></strong>DoE has developed a holistic energy model that captures the full, end-to-end energy value chain within Abu Dhabi against the wider context of the UAE. The ambition of this project is to work with our multiple government stakeholders to develop and maintain the energy model collectively and systematically. Upon completion, the model will be accessible to all government departments. DoE will then work across the government to test envisaged scenarios and support other departments' work and energy-related policy development. Having the whole energy ecosystem on one platform will provide valuable insight into Abu Dhabi's overall demand and supply balance, helping to identify the interplay and inevitable trade-offs to be considered between different government perspectives, outlook scenarios, and subsequent policy choices. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you explain some of the unique features of your operating mandate and what resources and expertise you bring to the local EPC market?<br></strong>Técnicas Reunidas started operations in the UAE in 2007. Our first project was for Borouge (utilities and offsite). We have completed milestone projects in the Shah oil field, Al Hosn Gas, GASCO, and ADNOC and recently started oilfield expansion works for Bu Hasa, one of the most critical projects for ADNOC in the UAE at present. The increase in capacity relates to the UAE's self-sufficiency goals and energy priorities. The targets set for Bu Hasa are ambitious and involve fast track development. Overall, we foresee this project being a huge success. Moreover, we have been awarded projects with ADNOC LNG and are currently doing a front-end engineering design (FEED) for ADNOC Offshore. In addition to this, we have also been entrusted to carry out the FEED for the Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB) plant in the Ruwais Derivatives Park by the JV formed between ADNOC and Mubadala (Cepsa). A large percentage of our total backlog is in the Middle East, and the UAE is our second-biggest market after Saudi Arabia. In the UAE, we collaboratively approach things with clients to find solutions. It is important for a company to create a legacy. Hence, our role is to build on existing partnerships to create further value. </p><p><strong>The introduction of ADNOC's in-country value (ICV) program has driven change in the local market, particularly with regards to tender evaluation and contractor selection. What has been your experience working with the ICV program?</strong><br>We became involved in the ICV two years before it was launched. ADNOC invited some of its key partners working with other regional nationalization programs to get together and share their experiences. Interestingly, the origin of Técnicas Reunidas is rooted in ICV. The leadership behind the ICV program is proactive in terms of appraising it and making necessary adjustments. Consequently, it is not reasonable for companies to come here, execute one project, and then leave. We are now planning a six-month-long training program for 100 Emiratis. We aim to do this not just for the good of ADNOC or Técnicas Reunidas but the country and its people.</p><p><strong>What are some of the ways you are working to develop local human capital and the next generation of oil and gas professionals? </strong><br>The program we have developed has three categories: for high school graduates, undergraduates, and university graduates. It starts as a general program and becomes more technical, depending on the level of education and potential, as we take students to our operational sites and oil and gas fields. The qualification authority in Abu Dhabi is interested in the program, and we are discussing ways to have appropriate certifications recognized by the National Qualifications Authority. We have been approached to enter into a JV with government learning centers, while several technical skills colleges have also shown interest in the program. We recognize that to engage young people we must apply a flexible approach. If these students develop a passion for a certain segment, we will be quick to recognize this and develop it further. </p><p><strong>Where do you see the long-term impact of the energy transition, and how will your business model evolve?<br></strong>Traditional oil and gas will be a mainstay for some years to come; however, we must go greener, and there are many different ways of achieving this. Going green can relate to optimization for synergy creation, efficiency, or sustainability. This is also an opportunity for the entire sector to reevaluate its relationship with oil, gas, and petrochemicals. There is no doubt that the demand for petrochemicals will increase in the next few years, but to transition and go greener, we need to capture CO2 and improve reinjection. Standards will have to evolve, especially with digitalization entering the mix. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has SONGWON positioned itself within Abu Dhabi's growing polymer sector?<br></strong>SONGWON established its plant in KIZAD in 2016, since which the company has become a part of the Emirate's growing polymers industry. KIZAD lies between Abu Dhabi and Dubai and is easily accessible by sea, air, and road. Its strategic location provides easy access to commercial, technical, and logistical support. This is a positive feature for us, as our raw materials arrive by sea from Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. Abu Dhabi itself is at the heart of the UAE and the Middle East, which together constitute a major consumer market for additive blends known as One Pack Systems (OPS) and one of the fastest-growing for polyolefins. Being located here places SONGWON in a strong position to meet regional demand and enables it to contribute to replacing imports with locally produced products. From Abu Dhabi, we supply customers in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Oman, and the UAE. Our OPS customers are pleased to have a locally based partner with a global reputation for quality, service, and technical compliance that can offer them the security of supply they demand. In addition, Abu Dhabi provides an excellent and secure investment climate that creates a sense of dependability which is beneficial for attracting talent.</p><p><strong>What has been SONGWON's experience growing a foreign company within Abu Dhabi's industrial landscape?<br></strong>SONGWON benefits from its status as a well-established global company. We already had links with a large customer base before our arrival in Abu Dhabi. At the same time, the polymers industry is highly regulated, so everyone has to go through approvals processes which can take quite some time. Even when one has a strong customer base before entering a new market, one still needs to learn new rules, regulations, and procedures, and all the various import/export requirements. In any market, these are things which are constantly evolving in different ways. When we established SONGWON's presence in Abu Dhabi, KIZAD was still in its early days, and the regulatory environment was fairly challenging. Processes were not yet completely streamlined, and there were infrastructural challenges and approval time visibility issues, while the required approvals themselves were not yet optimal. This gave rise to surprises that required a great deal of hands-on follow up. The positive side is that KIZAD's management was highly committed to making improvements from day one. Year after year, I have seen an impressive streamlining of KIZAD's organization and ease of doing business. Today, KIZAD has a clear IT and tracking system, building permit processes are easy to navigate, and all the contacts are in place. Furthermore, various key government ministries have also digitalized their systems. Any company setting up here today would find it a walk in the park.</p><p><strong>How does SONGWON leverage its operations in other markets and its global resources to enhance its work in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>SONGWON is a fully backward-integrated company, which is how we guarantee quality and availability to our customers. All our manufacturing facilities are equipped with the latest, state-of-the-art systems that are continuously upgraded. SONGWON's Maeam Plant in Korea, which has a 70,000-ton capacity per annum, is the world's largest fully back-integrated site dedicated to antioxidants. Apart from this plant, we have two more in Korea, two in China, one in Germany, one in the US, one in India, and one in the UAE. We match the technology between all of our plants. In addition to my capacity as the head of our operations in Abu Dhabi, I have a global role in maintaining the manufacturing excellence and safety levels across all of our lines, so I know that we are consistently leveraging SONGWON's experience abroad to our UAE operations and vice versa. The Abu Dhabi facility with its initial capacity of 7,000 tons per annum was also planned and constructed so that later expansion would be easy. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What factors drove OMV's acquisition of a 15% equity interest in ADNOC Refining and the creation of the company's first integrated downstream business outside Europe?</strong><br>OMV's acquisition of a 15% equity interest in ADNOC Refining can be considered as a transformational transaction. In fact, it represents a major milestone in the execution of our 2025 strategy, which focuses on producing assets and expansion into growing markets. With this transaction, OMV established a strong integrated position along Abu Dhabi's value chain, spanning from upstream production to refining, trading, and petrochemicals. OMV is now a strategic partner in the world's fourth largest refinery. ADNOC Refining includes the Ruwais East and West as well as the Abu Dhabi Refinery. It has a total capacity of 922,000bpd. With the newly acquired stake, OMV's refining and petrochemical capacities have increase by 40% and 10%, respectively.</p><p><strong>How would you assess the intrinsic value of having a strong integrated position across the value chain?<br></strong>As outlined in its 2025 strategy, OMV aims at growing its downstream oil business by exporting its successful refining and petrochemicals business model to international growth markets. We follow the same integrated business model of downstream oil that defines our success in Europe. OMV has both oil and gas concessions in Abu Dhabi, with high-quality oil production already in operation at the SARB and Umm Lulu fields. With 1.7 million tons of propylene capacity, ADNOC Refining is already forward-integrated into petrochemicals. Further value will be created by setting up the new global Trading Joint Venture with the same equity shareholdings as the ADNOC Refining partnership. It will likely start operation as early as 2020 and will be the international exporter of ADNOC Refining, considering that in 2019, roughly 70% of the production was exported internationally. OMV's know-how will support the development of the JV, optimizing systems and managing international feedstock and product flows, and hence maximizing the margins along the value chain.</p><p><strong>What are some of the company's technical competences that will be applied in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>In the downstream sector, OMV is a European champion with excellent operations. According to the Solomon benchmarks, OMV is a top performer in fuels and olefins. We are outperforming the market in important KPIs such as Net Cash Margin, Cash OPEX, and Maintenance Index. We are leading in Process Safety in Europe and in Project Management Excellence globally. This allows us to manage the best integrated oil value chain. Through the 15% stake in ADNOC, we are partner of a Middle East champion and we believe we can unlock further value by exporting our expertise and a successful European business model.</p><p><strong>What developments will be fundamental in meeting global demand while also considering environmental, social, and economic conditions?</strong><br>OMV will shift its production toward jet fuel because it has a positive outlook. Furthermore, we will upgrade our production to petrochemicals, while using oil as a feedstock for high-quality petrochemical products and polymers. Environmental, social, and economic needs can only be met if the recycling rate can be increased through the circular economy, not only by producing petrochemicals instead of fuels but also by prolonging the lifecycle of hydrocarbons. Raw material recycling is an innovative OMV research project that uses old plastics to produce synthetic refinery feedstock. OMV sees immense potential for its proprietary technology and its associated services in a society that is increasingly looking for alternative resources and value-added recycling. With our proprietary ReOil technology, we can produce one liter of synthetic crude for every kilogram of plastic waste. This year we strive for the scale up of the process with the clear aim to start building the first industrial scale plant as early as 2025. OMV aims at increasing the share of sustainable feedstock co-processed in the refineries to 200,000 tons per year by 2025. This way, the refinery will still be the place for the conversion and value generation, however, with a reduced CO2 footprint. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the UAE's nuclear regulatory framework developed over the last decade?<br></strong>The foundation for the UAE's nuclear regulatory framework was laid out in 2008 by the Nuclear Policy, which was codified in the Nuclear Law of 2009. Prior to this, there was no national framework in the UAE for nuclear energy or even radiation technology. The latter, particularly in the medical sector, had different frameworks across individual Emirates. FANR was assigned the huge task of harmonizing everything into one national system. This involved creating regulations for siting, nuclear power plant design, radiation protection, and plant licensing application processes. FANR has now issued around 20 regulations, and they are all on the internet, with the exception of a few that remain classified. We still have some regulations to be worked out in the area of waste management, but everything else is complete. One specific feature covered by our regulations is what we call naturally occurring radioactive materials (NORM). This has been particularly relevant to the work of Abu Dhabi Oil Refining Company, which has built a treatment facility licensed by FANR to deal with radium byproducts from the oil industry. The facility is not the only one of its kind in the world but is unique in the way that it treats naturally occurring radioactive waste. FANR also continually updates all its existing regulations, one example of which is our February 2019 revision of the regulations on radiation dose limits. These were amended to reflect new research and updated international standards concerning the risk posed by radiation to the lenses of the eyes of practitioners in hospitals. Research suggests the lens of the eye is more sensitive than previously thought; therefore, we have changed the dose limits accordingly to properly ensure the protection of the lens of eye for persons exposed. The UAE is one of the first countries in the world issuing legally binding regulations around this issue. </p><p><strong>How does the UAE differentiate itself as an environment for nuclear regulators to develop best practices?<br></strong>Nuclear regulation developed in the UAE without any pre-existing legacy, skills, or training institutions. There was some existing knowledge in the medical field, and from the oil and gas sector, but we have had to build upon it. For the most part, the knowledge and experience had to be built from scratch by drawing from overseas standards and expertise, and adapting to the UAE's unique environmental conditions, such as temperature, dust levels, and salinity. Particularly in the area of nuclear power plants, these conditions are relevant because they might impact the aging of metallic components. Presently, FANR takes these factors into account and consults with internationally well-known scientists in its review of the operating license application for Barakah, the UAE's first nuclear power plant. We are also taking steps to build a sound knowledge base in-country. For example, we have an ongoing research project supported by France's Institute of Radioprotection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) at Abu Dhabi's Khalifa University, where we educate Emiratis on how to calculate radioactive substance levels in the UAE's unique environment, including examining how radioactivity spreads in the desert.</p><p><strong>What are the latest developments with the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant?<br></strong>It is proceeding well. It is a huge project; they are building four reactors at the same time, which is not that common, in a country without any pre-existing nuclear plant infrastructure, so everything has been imported. FANR is in the final stage of dealing with any remaining issues we have from inspections, checking the plant has been built according to the planning documents, and in line with safety assessments, and that the operating organization is capable of running it effectively. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Can you walk us through the operating mandate of Arab Development and how your key services, areas of expertise, and portfolio within the oil and gas and water and power sectors have evolved since the inception of the organization?<br></strong>Arab Development first started in the 1980s when its primary area of focus was power; however, this evolved over time toward the energy sector. I come from an oil and gas background, which has been beneficial in allowing me to contribute and add value to the company. What's more, it granted me the opportunity to grow Arab Development into an established entity within the oil and gas sector, a sector close to my heart. I am comfortable navigating the vast segments of the industry and am able to do business with diverse stakeholders. Even though the organization started many years ago, it is still very much relevant in today's economy. Throughout time, we have invested heavily in building competence, knowledge, and resources. We are thus well positioned to help the private sector, especially ADNOC and its subsidiaries across varied specialisms and projects. As an example, we can assist in the services field or manufacturing. ADNOC is an integral part of the private sector and the economy of Abu Dhabi. Consequently, the leadership of ADNOC also recognizes the role that the private sector plays in helping them to achieve their goals. Dr. Sultan Al Jaber has made it clear that he would like greater collaboration and synergies to be created across the industry and has stated he would like to find ways of improving the quality of key services and find ways to reduce costs. We must be careful about how we propose reducing operating costs in the energy sector as it is a highly sensitive industry. It is essential to deploy the right equipment and people. If operational problems arise, the consequences can be grave. </p><p><strong>What role do you see Arab Development playing in helping ADNOC achieve its ambitious production targets?<br></strong>The best operational practice is for a company to deploy technology that optimizes and improves production. ADNOC's ambitions to increase production to 4 million bpd is a significant challenge. As a result, companies that are experienced in executing the work in the fields will gain traction. We have seen this already with the historic concessions that have been announced at different periods over the last two years. Many of these companies have proven competencies working in challenging environments. What's more, it will be interesting to see how these companies cope with some of the rigorous operating environments here and how smoothly they can integrate new technology. ADNOC makes decisions quickly these days and continuously adapts and overhauls procedures. Consequently, they also listen to what's going on in the sector.</p><p><strong>What has been your experience working with ADNOC's ICV program since it was first introduced? <br></strong>It has been one of the best things to happen to Abu Dhabi, but what's significant is ADNOC accepting to change within six months as per the demand of other companies. It keeps improving the ICV by continuously fine-tuning it. ADNOC doesn't want it to be rigid and knows there must be corrections along the way. What ICV does is ensure there is a better utilization of local resources, in particular, human resources, that can be trained in the engineering, operations, and the commercial side of the business. Since the establishment of the ICV, there is now a backlog of work for some companies in fabrications, installations, etc. There are visible areas where ICV cannot be applied effectively, such as in gas turbines, big machinery, or motors. But everywhere else, there is great scope for Emiratization. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-best-interest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are your priorities in your first year of operation, and how do you expect to impact the financial ecosystem of Abu Dhabi? <br></strong>The fund's aim is to realize commercial returns by partnering with top tier investment firms and industry-leading businesses that can benefit from building a meaningful and sustainable presence in the Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). Abu Dhabi Catalyst Partners is backed by Mubadala, which has been instrumental in helping us launch. As a new entity, we have invested time in hiring exceptional talent, obtaining licenses, and building our corporate infrastructure. We want to make a positive impact across ADGM's financial ecosystem. Therefore, when evaluating investment opportunities, we not only consider financial returns but also evaluate the wider impact we can have on ADGM and Abu Dhabi. </p><p><strong>What are some of the opportunities you are currently exploring both domestically and internationally? <br></strong>We are considering various strategic and long-term opportunities that complement Abu Dhabi's own ambitions. Given its geographic location, Abu Dhabi is a natural transportation and logistics center. ADGM has the potential to become a financial hub that supports both industries. As a bridge between the region and major financial markets, Abu Dhabi can offer unrivalled opportunities for companies to expand internationally. We have an ambitious investment strategy targeting opportunities across asset management, specialty finance, and financial infrastructure. Investees are expected to have a presence in ADGM to create a positive impact on job creation and engagement with the wider ADGM ecosystem. In the long term, we are interested in opportunities presented by India and Africa due to their proximity to Abu Dhabi. </p><p><strong>How are you working to grow both the indigenous and global talent of Abu Dhabi?   <br></strong>We want to ensure that jobs are not affected by market volatility and have a meaningful purpose. Employment opportunities should be sustainable over the long-term. Transportation will evolve, but in 100 years there will still be a need for people to travel and trade. Growing talent is about mapping out core areas of interest. This requires a broad range of skills from the UAE and abroad. Formal education is important in nurturing talent; however, job training and mentoring is equally important. We place emphasis on ensuring that our investees hire locally and train their employees regularly. </p><p><strong>Abu Dhabi has become known as a regional hub for fintech. Where do you see opportunities here?<br></strong>It is a cliché to state that technology is changing everything, but it is. We consider technology in its widest possible context and how it impacts all of the businesses in which we invest, not just financial services. For example, a crucial part of logistics is managing data. These days, it happens increasingly over mobile phones. Generally, technology is transforming sectors such as banking, oil, and shipping to ensure they are more efficient in operations. A good example of this can be seen in how Palantir Technologies, the Silicon Valley-based tech firm, has optimized flows of oil through BP's pipeline network, increasing its delivery of oil by 30,000bpd. We are interested in nurturing this type of technology company by bringing them to ADGM. <br></p><p><strong>How would you summarize the advantage of ADGM as an option for global asset managers, international lenders, investment funds, and tech companies? </strong><br>Abu Dhabi is a premier financial district for many reasons. Firstly, 80% of the world's population lies within an eight-hour flight of Abu Dhabi. We are strategically located to conduct business with large parts of the world. ADGM is also one of the world's fastest-growing onshore financial hubs. The regulatory authority has done an excellent job facilitating investment and commerce and is open to collaborate on best-practice initiatives. A good example is the leadership role ADGM has taken with cryptocurrencies, as well as the creation of the first digital legal system. Finally, Abu Dhabi remains an attractive tourist and residential destination. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are ECSSR's current policy priorities for the UAE and region? <br></strong>Over the past 25 years, ECSSR has supported the UAE's development by providing the nation's decision-makers with studies, ideas, and recommendations that best serve the country's interests. ECSSR also cooperates with national ministries, authorities, and institutions to support its respective objectives. ECSSR is effective in conducting field studies, public opinion polls, and offering ideas to aid the realization of national goals. Additionally, we recently created the Storm of Thought Alliance to unify the efforts of Arab think tanks, mainly in countries taking part in the Decisive Storm coalition in Yemen, to support respective decision-makers and enhance national and regional security. Moreover, we have entered into cooperation agreements with several Arab research and academic institutions in our effort to support scientific research and development pertaining to regional challenges. ECSSR examines a broad spectrum of political, economic, social, and security issues, continually seeking a realistic evaluation of these issues to anticipate future outcomes. This approach allows us to determine the priorities of the center while also increasing the accuracy of our recommendations.  ECSSR will intensify its focus on the impact of the Industry 4.0 and AI, as these issues will have a significant impact on the future security, stability, and development of our region and the world. Looking ahead, ECSSR will continue to focus on issues related to educational development, addressing extremist thought, and exploring energy development opportunities. We will support the national priorities of enhancing constructive societal values such as tolerance, centrism, moderation, coexistence, and openness. </p><p><strong>What is the best way for the UAE to navigate the tension between cybersecurity and individual data privacy?<br></strong>Weighing the protection of individual privacy and data and fighting the threat of possible cyber-attacks is not a big issue. They are two interdependent approaches. Protecting online personal data is essential to ensuring trust in cyberspace and for the safe use of ICT, particularly when it comes to financial activity. Similarly, cybersecurity for government and private sector institutions is critical to national security, considering the massive threat hacking poses to potentially disrupt, destroy, and steal data. This is a particular concern in light of the global shift toward automation and the widespread reliance on modern information and communications technology in services and activities critical to national security. The nation should seek to ensure the protection, as much as possible, of the data privacy of individuals and institutions by enacting legislation to sanction individuals or entities found to be violating privacy or attempting to damage state institutions. This does not impede the state's right to monitor social media use and content published online in order to protect individuals and prevent the internet's misuse, which jeopardizes security and stability.</p><p><strong>What key areas is the UAE poised to play a regional leadership role in over the next decade?<br></strong>The UAE has become a powerful and active force in the region as it advocates security, stability, and development. It is a pioneering role model for the region and the best destination for Arab youth. The UAE tirelessly seeks to spread positive values that promote tolerance, peace, and progress to oppose sectarian forces that incite violence, hatred, and extremism. The UAE's leadership also possesses the determination and perseverance to confront any risk that threatens the country's national security, interests, or prosperity. There are many areas where the UAE can play a leading role in the region over the next five years. One of the most important will be leading the region toward Industry 4.0 and the age of AI. The UAE can also lead the way in ensuring sustainable and comprehensive development in the post oil-era, as well as spreading tolerance, moderation, and openness to combat extremism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How important is the role of data collection?<br></strong>Data plays an integral role in society; it facilitates policy development and supports decision-makers in making effective choices. As a result, governments throughout the world utilize data. At SCAD, we have produced more than 1,800 indicators across various domains and sectors of the economy. We have targets to reach 4,200 indicators. This work contributes to the overall economy. It supports the various departments across the Abu Dhabi government and Abu Dhabi Executive Council. Looking more broadly at the economy, by having an accessible, transparent, local official data source, international investors have a clearer sense of the opportunities in Abu Dhabi. </p><p><strong>How are you working to change the culture and mindset around data collection?<br></strong>In our daily lives, we use data for a whole range of things. We are subconsciously making decisions based on data. Perhaps as a society, we sometimes take this for granted. Needless to say, it is crucial to demonstrate the importance of data to both the public and private sectors as well as members of the general public, the youth, and decision-makers. It is equally essential to make the data interesting and accessible to non-experts. Analysis should be based on facts, even if individual stakeholders have differing theories or views. Overall, this supports an effective and balanced decision-making process. </p><p><strong>How does the existence of SCAD ensure that bias is reduced?<br></strong>Bias is often described to be a deviation from the truth that may occur in the collection, analysis, interpretation, or publication of data. To ensure that bias is reduced, SCAD conducts the collection storage, analysis, and dissemination of official statistics in accordance with international standards and ethics. It is the core mandate of SCAD to conduct statistical surveys without prejudice of national statistical work. What's more, in SCAD's capacity as an independent regulator, the transparency of available data is improved. </p><p><strong>How do you see AI playing a role in the interpretation of data? Moreover, how can technology serve to attract young statisticians to this career? </strong><br>AI, digitalization, and other innovative technological trends are certainly buzzwords. SCAD carefully monitors the developments in areas such as AI and how these might have practical use cases for the organization. Overall, we are open to using resources and initiatives that help us deliver on our mandate. An interesting case for using AI in data is its ability to track enumerators in the field, with one application being able to analyze how households build trust with enumerators. SCAD can approach this technology advantageously thanks to the volume of data we have. What's more, innovative technology is a way of attracting young talent to the organization. Looking ahead, we want to engage fresh minds, especially in research and development. By having a culture of innovation, we are poised to advance as an organization. At present, we engage young statisticians through scholarship and secondments. In addition to this, we collaborate with other leading statistical organizations worldwide in the area of knowledge transfer. We have sent some of our people to countries such as Germany, South Korea, the US, and Singapore. These multicultural exchanges enable personal as well as professional development. </p><p><strong>Are there any specific international models or standards that SCAD follows?<br></strong>Like any statistics agency in the world, statisticians have standards. We follow international standards set by the IMF and UN, as well as our national agendas. Our first priority is to the national agenda, as our goal is to contribute to the Abu Dhabi government. SCAD participates in international events related to statistics, and we attend the UN's international statistics conference every year. SCAD has a deep awareness of international best practices. We aim to acquire new technologies and deploy these in Abu Dhabi, as long as they are in line with the laws and regulations of the UAE. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Within the last year, PTTEP was awarded an exploration agreement for two offshore blocks in Abu Dhabi. What resources and expertise does it bring to this project, and what competencies does ADNOC expect from a partner in a project of this magnitude?<br></strong>With our expertise in operating offshore fields from exploration and development through to production for more than 35 years in Southeast Asia, we bring all of our capabilities, experience, and technology along with a culture of ensuring safe and efficient operations to explore and develop projects in the Middle East. </p><p><strong>What are some of the synergies created between PTTEP and other major stakeholders across the various shared operating environments in Abu Dhabi?</strong><br>With PTTEP's vision of being the Energy Partner of Choice, PTTEP strongly recognizes the importance of cooperation and partnerships, and a crucial element to each partnership is to ensure sustainable value creation to all stakeholders. We always look for partnerships within the same scale or broader portfolios to create shared value, as part of our expansion strategy in our focus regions of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. As well as our experience of being a partner in numerous successful collaborations, we are confident that our differentiated technical capability is another vital key that allows us to operate in various operating environments. Most importantly, PTTEP's implementation of operational excellence across many countries and cultures means we have built up an understanding of how to operate in many environments, which enables us to effectively leverage our geographical know-how, local knowledge, government relations, and service provider connections.</p><p><strong>As the global oil and gas sector seeks to become more cost-effective and boost sustainable production, what are some of the ways that PTTEP is driving efficiencies, reducing capex, and optimizing assets across its diverse operations?</strong><br>Since the crisis in 2014, the E&amp;P industry has faced  a number of challenges. In response, PTTEP has restructured its cost base, resulting in unit cost reduction by 30%. In order to maintain this, PTTEP has also outlined a transformation program focusing on key digital and organizational pillars. Digital transformation enhances competitiveness across the E&amp;P value chain with AI, machine learning, and natural language processing applied across the value chain to automate processes and radically enhance the speed of decision making, accuracy, and productivity, like in accelerating subsurface and drilling activities, real-time optimization of production, and minimizing unplanned shutdown. Moreover, PTTEP has striven to become an agile organization, streamlining internal approval processes, encouraging trust and empowerment, and emphasizing team-based spirit to ensure strong long-term foundations.</p><p><strong>The implementation of digitalization, big data, automation, and the IoT is driving change across the oil and gas sector? What innovative technologies are you exploring and deploying over the next decade?</strong><br>PTTEP continues to develop technology and innovation in three key areas: enhance E&amp;P business, minimize the environmental impact for sustainable development; and explore future energy opportunities in preparation for energy transition. Our technology focuses on E&amp;P-specific challenges facing PTTEP, such as CO2 and H2S removal from gas, or Hg removal from condensate, while also allowing the company to operate responsibly at a lower carbon footprint with carbon capture utilization opportunities. In addition, we have embarked on the journey of digital transformation by implementing digital technology such as the application of AI, machine learning, and data analytics to help maintain cost competitiveness, increase efficiencies, and improve safety across all value chains. As a result, AI and Robotics Ventures Limited (ARV), a PTTEP subsidiary, was established in 2019 to provide cutting-edge solutions such as facility inspection and subsea pipeline surveillance and repair to support our E&amp;P activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>LUKOIL has recently been awarded a 5% stake in the Ghasha ultra-sour gas concession. What resources and expertise will Lukoil bring to this project?</strong><br>LUKOIL is the first Russian energy company to enter Abu Dhabi's upstream sector. In Russia, our company holds leading positions in offshore developments. Our benchmark project is the North Caspian integrated production complex, which consists of 10 fields and 10 prospective structures with total recoverable reserves of 7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In terms of technical complexity, the Caspian project is one of the most advanced in Russia. The company-owned institute, LUKOIL Engineering, engineers this development. An Integrated Operations Center also allows us to perform real-time control of production and significantly increases operational efficiency. Besides, LUKOIL has strict environmental policies. All our offshore projects follow the Zero Discharge principle. We are ready to share the company's expertise in the fields of integrated offshore developments, digitalization, and environmental protection with our business partners.  </p><p><strong>What are some of the synergies you expect to be created between LUKOIL and other concession holders, Eni, Wintershall Dea, and OMV, across operating environments?</strong><br>The Ghasha ultra-sour gas project is known for its challenging operating conditions. To ensure smooth synergy and positive outcomes, effective communication is necessary. I believe that for streamlined cooperation with concession's partners and with ADNOC, it is beneficial to have a “think pot" for digesting solutions and articulating ideas. The success of the Ghasha project ultimately relies on the professionalism and mutual decision-making from all the concession holders. Moreover, I think that work on such challenging and sophisticated project is a great opportunity to share the best patterns of corporate culture.</p><p><strong>As the global oil and gas sector seeks to create better cost-effectiveness and more sustainable production, how will Lukoil drive efficiencies, reduce CapEx, and optimize assets across its operations?</strong><br>The company approved a 10-year strategic program in 2017 primarily targeted at efficiency improvements and growth in financial results. In the upstream sector, we focus on assets with high profitability and high growth potential. For existing assets, our main aims are to maintain production rates and improve operational efficiency. The main instruments here are: digitalization, reducing losses of all kinds, increasing oil recovery, and saving on drilling and completion costs etc.  </p><p><strong>The implementation of digitization, big data, automation, and the IoTs are driving evolution across the sector. What innovations are you deploying across your operations?</strong><br>LUKOIL is a recognized leader in Russia in integrated production modelling. In 2019, the company won the ComNews Award for the Best IT Project for its digital production system in West Siberia. A key question that can be asked is: what is the difference between LUKOIL's setup compared to our competitors? Let's think back. Initially, it was not digitalization, but a comprehensive model of processing production operations, which was invented in the North Sea in 1990s. For Russian companies that operate onshore with significant well stocks, it can be more challenging to establish a similar approach. We must follow each given well to ensure monitoring throughout development. We created a system for these processes; at present, this has been deployed in various regions in Russia. The approach, known as a Choke Model, is a standard that is followed by many organizations across diverse industries. We seek opportunities to save in every aspect of the production chain. Energy efficiency is one of such options. In this respect, our latest innovative product, the permanent magnet motor for electric submersible pumps. Comparing this to asynchronous electric motors, PMM has a smaller size, higher efficiency factor (up to 92%), and lower energy consumption (25% saving in electricity costs). It is made of heat-resistant materials that allows using it for production during well-thermal stimulation. LUKOIL is already offering this motor to the Middle East market. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[pool-it-together]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Watania evolved, and how do you meet the demands for sharia-compliant insurance products in the UAE?</strong>Watania is a takaful company established in 2011 by Abu Dhabi National Insurance Company (ADNIC); Abu Dhabi National Islamic Finance (ADNIF), the sharia arm of National Bank of Abu Dhabi (NBAD); Aldar; and Abu Dhabi National Energy Company. In 2014, some of these founder shareholders decided to sell their stake in Watania, with the UAE's MB Holdings and Oman's Al Madina Takaful buying major shares of the stake. Meanwhile, the Insurance Authority (IA) established a well-regulated takaful system: Each takaful company has its own sharia committee, and we certify and approve our products through the committee. Watania's core products are medical and motor, though it also does property, casualty, engineering, and others to complement our product portfolio. As a takaful company, it is important to create a policyholders pool and retain a significant portion of that contribution pool. With the capital structure being what it is, writing middle-of-the-road businesses, which includes small business units, retail, individuals, and so on, aligns itself well with these basic principles. It is important for a takaful company to be conservative in terms of using its capital wisely to write business in segments that generate surpluses and are sustainable. </p><p><strong>How do you assess the role of the IA in the development of the sector?<br></strong>The IA assesses the industry, which is comprised of conventional and Islamic businesses. Regulations are always viewed from the perspective of the industry, as opposed to a particular segment. Takaful insurance regulation was introduced in the UAE in 2010, so the industry is still young and will continue to evolve as the regulators review and update regulations to keep pace with the sector's growth and development. Meanwhile, the IA's introduction of e-forms go a long way in creating a level playing field for companies and implementing financial discipline that adopts a uniform approach for all the companies. Regulations require all stakeholders to come together and draft laws and regulations that provides the right framework. Many scholars and practioners believe that existing laws are not aligned with takaful principles when it comes to the minimum capital requirement. Risk-based capital structure could be a more viable and possibly equitable alternative to the current regulation and could have a significant impact on takaful company's business model.</p><p><strong>What will be the significance of further consolidation and mergers across the local industry?<br></strong>We have seen some M&amp;A activity in the insurance sector, with Takaful Emarat taking over Al Hilal Takaful as the latest UAE example. The IA's initiatives focusing on strengthening capital, reserves, and governance could result in a significant consolidation of the market. While this will not resolve the challenges of a fragmented market, it will be an improvement on the current situation, where 66% of the market is controlled by six companies and 34% is between 56 companies. Consolidation will lead to better use of capital; investment in new technology; optimization of operational expense; and improved service and offerings, thus increasing insurance penetration.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the coming year, and how do you expect demand to evolve?<br></strong>While we did not grow as planned in 2018, we were well ahead of the market growth of less than 1%. We expect growth to be more modest, if not flat. The lack of liquidity and general economic conditions will impede market growth. We are optimistic about the medium term as there are number of development items on the anvil. Overall, the insurance industry's future, including takaful, is bright for two reasons: GDP is still expected to grow at around 3%, and this growth will drive the industries relevant to insurance sector. Second, current conditions are influenced to a great extent by the current political climate, which has created volatility in the financial markets. After this is resolved, things will move in the right direction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What key factors have contributed to your recent profit growth, and how does diversification feature in this?<br></strong>We can attribute our success to a culture of teamwork and a commitment to developing, mentoring, guiding, and empowering our people. Through comprehensive training, we have also provided a platform for our employees to upskill, and we were proud to recently host the globally renowned motivational speaker, Ron Kaufman. Another contributing factor to our success is the continuous improvement of our processes. As a leading multi-line insurer with a wide range of general, health and life products, business diversification does play a role in ADNIC's success. However, we do not pursue breadth at the expense of profitability or service quality. It is an ongoing task to keep abreast of the evolving expectations and needs of our existing and potential customers. </p><p><strong>What is the significance of your recent partnership with Al Etihad Credit Bureau (AECB) regarding the controlling and managing of risk across your operations?</strong><br>A major challenge in the insurance market is receivables, and signing the agreement with AECB is in line with ADNIC's mission to adopt innovative solutions in the insurance industry and implement international best practices. The move helps to further strengthen our ability to control and manage credit risk exposure in our operations, and in turn proactively select clients on the basis of appropriate credit and financial screening</p><p><strong>What is your view on the Insurance Authority and its contribution to market development? <br></strong>The regulator always adds value to the sector and ensures best practices are implemented. Additionally, it ensures that companies can continue to operate and honor the obligations to meet minimum solvency margins. The insurance authority sets clear financial guidelines and is also a strong advocate of clear, regular financial reporting, which is currently at a level of extensive electronic reporting. Among the most important financial guidelines issued by the regulator are investment allocations for different asset classes like real estate and equities. The solvency margin and capital adequacy are important in safeguarding the interests of policyholders and shareholders alike. Another notable exercise is the price review, which requires half-yearly reports from companies on the performance of each business line. This gives the authority accurate data on the state of the industry, both individually and overall, including CEO-level input on prospective developments. </p><p><strong>What is the role of technology when it comes to streamlining processes ? <br></strong>Investment in technology is a major focus for ADNIC, as we are aware that adoption of automation and digitalization will be necessary to meet the expectations of our clients. Furthermore, we appreciate that our clients and retail customers are keen to access insurance processes via their smartphone. Mobile apps allow individual customers to buy insurance and launch and follow up on their claims through their devices, while enabling call centers to respond immediately to simple transactions for basic products that require deep technology adoption.<br><br><strong>How can the insurance industry continue to evolve and what are your expectations looking ahead?<br></strong>Regarding the contribution of the insurance industry to the overall economy, the penetration rate in the UAE today is below 2.5%, or one-third of the European average. Therefore, the contribution of insurance to GDP is thin; however, the penetration rate in the UAE is still higher than most of the countries in the region. The positive side of this is growth potential. Apart from the penetration rate and share of the insurance industry in the overall economy, insurance is the backbone of commercial businesses as no enterprise can operate without it. With more than 60 players in the market, the sector is clearly competitive; therefore, M&amp;A activities may happen but could take time. We are optimistic about project growth both at the top and bottom line and see signs of growth in the market and the wider economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does CBC promote trade, investment, and commerce between the UAE and Canada?<br></strong>CBC promotes the bilateral economic relationship by serving as a hub for the private sector to network, grow relationships, discuss business trends, and identify opportunities. Our key mechanisms are events, marketing, roundtables, and our Community of Interest (COI) programs. CBC events include informative business seminars, ambassador's receptions for Canadian business delegations, community galas, and social events. Recently, member organizations have turned to CBC for business advice, advocacy, digital marketing across borders, and access to exclusive roundtables with visiting Canadian organizations. For example, we hosted a roundtable for a leading Canadian organization to meet with UAE-based experts to discuss healthcare, youth, and education. We have also significantly expanded our marketing outreach through a combination of an improved online presence, social media, newsletters, email lists, and strategic partnerships. For example, we partnered with the organizers of leading conferences such as Global Aerospace Summit, Global Space Congress, and Abu Dhabi International Exhibition &amp; Conference (ADIPEC). Such exposure has benefited our corporate members, which include Bank of Montreal (BMO), SNC-Lavalin, Bombardier, PAL Aerospace, and Air Canada, and UAE brands with Canadian interests such as UE Medical, Al Amal Business Services, Apparel Group, Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange (ADX), and Concorde Corodex. Our business connections and expertise, coupled with our reputation in the UAE and Canada, have enabled us to successfully use our mechanisms to promote bilateral trade and investment.</p><p><strong>Where do you see the greatest potential for increased trade?<br></strong>The greatest potential is in technologies and innovations where Canada has long been a world-class leader, given the UAE's continued vision to develop and adopt innovations and digital trends. Potential sectors include aerospace, energy, healthcare, clean technology, IT, and AI. For example, the WEF and UAE have recognized AI as fundamental to the fourth industrial revolution. We are seeing many sectors eager to explore AI and its benefits. Canada has an AI legacy, with world-leading hubs in Montreal and Toronto that have attracted investment from companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft. Other significant areas include healthcare, as evident through UEMedical's partnership with Canada's SickKids Hospital; energy, as evident through the province of Alberta's decision to expand its trade presence in the UAE and Mubadala's multi-billion dollar investments in the Canadian energy sector; and space, as evident through the MoU signed between the Canadian space agency and the UAE space agency. This increased bilateral relationship and trade growth is a sign of innovative Canadian technologies and capabilities and the Canadian private sector's confidence in the UAE's legal system, business practices, and stability. We project trade to further increase given such opportunities, common sectors of interest, and business environment.</p><p><strong>How will the shared values between Canada and the UAE serve to deepen the bilateral relationship?<br></strong>There are evident similarities between the UAE and Canada's values, for example on tolerance and women's empowerment. Canada has long been globally recognized as a leader in tolerance, with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom at its core. This is evident through examples such as its progressive immigration system, acceptance of refugees, protection of indigenous rights, and the maintenance of a gender-balanced cabinet. Tolerance is also one of the UAE's core values, with its Ministry of Tolerance and National Tolerance Program. With about 200 nationalities that are resident here, the UAE made 2019 its Year of Tolerance with key milestones such as the Papal visit and mandating that 50% of Federal National Council (FNC) members be women. The implications of such shared values are strengthened people-to-people relationships. This makes it more attractive for Canadians to feel accepted and call the UAE home, move their families here, and make long-term investments such as buying property. Similarly, Emiratis are able to integrate within Canadian society to study, train, and work. They then bring back knowledge and contribute to enriching the UAE and developing its knowledge-based society. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What sectors are the most appealing to Ali &amp; Sons?<br></strong>In general, Abu Dhabi is reliant on the oil and gas sector, which has always been a major contributor to its society and the primary driver of its economy. Within this space, there are more projects launching and a corresponding rise in the number of opportunities, which will have a positive effect on businesses over the next six to 12 months. The ongoing consolidation in the oil and gas industry is going to drive our focus in this space further by creating more relationships and partnerships. The entry of new investors also demonstrates that there is more trust in the market. Their investment brings more entities and businesses along with it, and that is all going to help the economy. Furthermore, the government has realized the value of economic support; hence, it launched the 'Ghaddan 2021' initiative, which includes a wide-ranging support package.</p><p><strong>How do you create synergies within Ali &amp; Sons subsidiaries?<br></strong>The biggest challenge that most companies have is communication—whether it be digital, face-to-face, or even with the past via lessons learned. This is why Ali &amp; Sons focuses on making people talk and communicate with each other. We want to continuously invent ways to streamline conversations and make them more accessible. For example, we focus on our ERP and quality systems, as well as on holding regular meetings with stakeholders and partner companies. At least quarterly, we have offsite discussions to exchange ideas and to just sit and take stock or have a structured brainstorming session. Intranet is also an important tool for us and a medium for developing and introducing new initiatives. We create award structures for employees with the best new ideas. We want to reach a point where our ERP reaches 80%, which we expect to achieve in 2020. </p><p><strong>What are your thoughts on expanding outside of the UAE?<br></strong>I would rather go international with a partner who has already done it. So, if ADNOC said it was entering other countries, I would go with them as they are my client, and I am comfortable working with them. They are, in fact, looking to move into overseas markets with some of their business units, and that is where our opportunity to go abroad lies. But there are a number of things we can do in the UAE. If you talk about the oil and gas sector, unconventional methods are coming up, and we in the UAE are still behind what is happening in North America. There is an increasing number of technologies, materials, and equipment that we can bring to the UAE. This means there are several opportunities left to uncover here at home. </p><p><strong>What would you say to international investors about entering the Abu Dhabi market?<br></strong>For our investment decisions in the UAE market, we consider the same variables that a foreign company would. They look at the long-term strategic investment potential, GDP growth, and the new plans coming in the region. Typically, the GCC has been a region that constantly bucks global market trends, meaning that even when there is a global downturn, the GCC still sees investment. At the same time, events in other parts of the world do affect domestic sentiment. In general, the GCC's business community relies heavily on belief and gut feelings, and its investors tend to develop emotional attachments to the businesses they are building. This means that as long as they are able to, they usually continue sustaining their investments for the long term, which creates a climate of stability. With all this in mind, if you are looking for a region that is stable, has a clean legal structure, is always looking for advancements, challenges, and technology, and is a base from which you can enter other neighboring geographies, there is no better place than the UAE. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the vision behind Hub71?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi's government has put in place a range of initiatives designed to accelerate the existing economic agenda and Abu Dhabi's integration into the global economy as a place that is even more dynamic, innovative, and technology-orientated than it is today. To this end, an AED50-billion economic program called Ghadan 21, meaning “tomorrow" in Arabic, is leading the charge; Hub71 is a key initiative of it. Hub71 was created to form the optimal environment for transformative tech companies and to further enhance the economy. As part of Ghadan 21's mandate to make Abu Dhabi one of the best places in the world to live, work, visit, and do business, we are supporting the 'knowledge' pillar. Technology is the cornerstone of Abu Dhabi's strategic growth story, from supporting private start-ups and entrepreneurs to bringing technology to all of society. Our mandate at Hub71 is more than just building up start-ups and helping them succeed. It is about making sure the whole ecosystem is working in their favor and providing favorable conditions for them to thrive in the long term. It is about creating opportunities that nurture the creation of new jobs, sectors, and home-grown technologies.</p><p><strong>As a newly established ecosystem that attracts start-ups and investors, what are the next steps to attract firms exhibiting high potential?</strong><br>When we launched, we researched what affects start-ups and VCs all around the world. We wanted to design a program that was unique and impactful, and make Hub71 stand out. In addition, we came up with the Hub71 Incentive Program, which helps start-ups with their overhead costs by providing 50-100% non-equity incentives consisting of subsidized housing, office space, and health insurance, depending on their size. But the benefits extend beyond this. Our job in building a complete ecosystem includes providing access to funding and market opportunities, and a favorable business environment to thrive in. And part of that means building a thriving VC and investor community. Just recently, we announced several VCs, including San Francisco-based DCVC, MEVP, and Global Ventures, coming to Hub71. The start-up ecosystem is growing quickly in the MENA region, with USD517 million being invested in 354 deals in 2019 thus far, an increase of 30% YoY. The UAE continued to account for the largest share of total funding, measuring 62% in 2019. Given Abu Dhabi's strategic geographic location, it is a great hub to base oneself.<br> <br><strong>What attractive features does Abu Dhabi offer as an emerging technology destination? <br></strong>The government is investing in putting the Emirate on the map as a regional technology hub. The signs are positive: Of the 156 institutions that invested in MENA start-ups in 2018, 30% were from outside the region. The UAE is at the center of this investment, where over 30% of all MENA deals are done. The programs we have in place are competitive enough to encourage investment from everywhere. The UAE is one of the first adopters of 5G and the first to appoint an AI minister. We had our first Emirati in space and saw the creation of Hub71; all this is evidence that the government is serious about making Abu Dhabi a regional hub for technology. According to the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness 2019 Report, the UAE has maintained its top spot for the fourth year as the most competitive economy in MENA on macroeconomic stability, infrastructure, technology, and business dynamism. In fact, more than 20% of our start-ups are UK- or US-based: they include Surkus, the world-leading experiential marketing company, Humanitas, an AI company driving social enterprise and philanthropy, Ammbrtech, a blockchain and telecoms infrastructure company, and Dopay, a UK-based cloud-based payroll service. They tell us that Hub71 has provided them with the impetus to make the move to Abu Dhabi. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the core principles that drive your investment strategy?<br></strong>Creating sustainable returns for our shareholders and investors is at the heart of Waha Capital's investment strategy. When assessing any potential investment, be it for our asset management or private investments division, we not only look at growth prospects by gauging potential appreciation, valuation, and internal rate of return metrics, but at recurring income because cash flow is a key metric for our business and shareholders. Waha Capital has the ability to invest across various phases of the investment cycle, so long as there is a clear growth trajectory and a path to profitably exit. Our strategy with private investments has always focused on taking an active investment approach. As such, we will continue to make investments in companies where we have a seat on the board and a substantial say. With regard to our asset management business, we continue to implement a robust governance framework that focuses on making measured cumulative gains over the years and managing funds entrusted to us in the most prudent manner while hedging our securities trading through a long-short strategy to reduce risks. </p><p><strong>What are some of the specific sectors you target?<br></strong>With asset management, we take an opportunistic approach, investing in multiple sectors and regions. Our private investment division has historically been overly dependent on the energy sector but given the boom in technology, we are increasingly looking at the promising field of technology and fintech. As a firm, we invested in Channel VAS, a fintech firm serving 500 million clients in 29 countries. Despite the massive boom in valuations of technology globally, we are still bullish and continue to appraise opportunities in the tech sector, especially fintech. We are also looking at the pharmaceutical sector as an area that we may invest in. Even though the medical sector has faced challenges, we have grown revenues at Arabian Anglo Healthcare, one of our portfolio companies, by almost 21% since 2016. </p><p><strong>What are some ways you are looking at the technology sector for opportunities?<br></strong>At Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM), several strategic incubators that focus on harnessing the potential of fintech have been set up to nurture growth in this key sector. The UAE has already been successful in this domain, and the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) is another entity that has been able to attract fintech firms. The technology sector is key to attracting FDI into Abu Dhabi, and we will be keeping a close eye on developments in the sector. </p><p><strong>What are the investment benefits of Abu Dhabi and the region?<br></strong>The UAE is a highly desirable location due to its attractive tax structure, world-class infrastructure, safety, security, and limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs and professionals. The country is guided by a forward-thinking leadership whose primary focus is the development of human capital. One of the most important things our leadership's vision stands for is the desire to explore new trends. Furthermore, the government is willing to explore innovation trends. In terms of technology, the sophistication and the penetration across the UAE government is more advanced than many countries in Europe. </p><p><strong>How will Waha Capital advance and develop over the next decade?<br></strong>In the asset management division, Waha Capital has become an established brand. Over the next decade, we will consolidate the brand by adding new funds to ensure smoother cashflow. We will not, however, adopt a one-size-fits-all formula and will continue to explore a broad array of different sectors to complement our existing investments. In the technology space, for example, digital banking is gaining further traction, we now have blockchain, and the next focus will be data. These areas exhibit growth potential, especially specific sectors within the data domain itself. We have an excellent future ahead of us in terms of profitability, return, and organic growth. These elements, coupled with our robust risk-reward scheme, will ensure excellent returns for our shareholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about the defining features of Shell's operations in Abu Dhabi and the significance of the UAE for the company?<br></strong>In 2019, we will celebrate our 80th anniversary in the UAE. This is a journey we started back in 1939, and our relationship here began in Abu Dhabi but expanded to include Dubai. Historically, we had a 9.5% stake in ADCO until the license expired in 2013. In 1978, we established ADNOC Gas Industries, or GASCO, a joint venture with Total and Partex. We hold 15% alongside Total's 15% with Partex having 2% and ADNOC maintaining a 68% share. Two years ago, we celebrated 50 years in Dubai, where we have been supplying aviation fuel and with a significant market share of that going to Dubai's airports to this day. With more than 500 staff across the Emirates, we are firmly committed to the UAE. We have a significant presence across the full value chain, including upstream, midstream, and downstream. With trading offices for some of our products, we supply chemicals, lubricants, and commercial fuels. Strategically, we deliver regional support to areas such as Iraq and other joint ventures in markets such as Oman and Kuwait. While our concession continues for another ten years or so, we are exploring other opportunities in which we can partner. Our discussions with ADNOC aim to uncover how we can best align their priorities with our financial framework.</p><p><strong>Where do you see opportunities to deepen this relationship with the UAE further, and what else are you also exploring?<br></strong>Beyond the joint ventures we have been involved in with ADNOC, R&amp;D, and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) competency have both been key to our efforts to support ADNOC. There is also strong support for upstream, midstream, and downstream activity. Additionally, we are also involved in human capital support with ADNOC Gas Processing and have secondees in various ADNOC departments such as finance and HR. Our gas research<br>center was set up in 2010 with several ongoing projects in conjunction with the Petroleum Institute, which today is a part of Khalifa University. Shell is a lot more involved with gas when we compare our portfolio to other IOCs, which was by design. Shell has also made bold commitments in regards to greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding collaborations, we will continue to look at where other projects can develop in step with ADNOC.</p><p><strong>How are you working in EOR projects, and how do you assess Abu Dhabi's EOR targets?<br></strong>Shell has vast expertise in EOR projects built up over 40 years and is probably the leader in EOR. This experience has been developed in neighboring countries. ADNOC's oil target goes from 3.5 to 4 to 5 million barrels. They are well-managed reservoirs, but the question is how do you extract more from them, and with gas injections of CO2, can they be effective? There are a number of pilot schemes being deployed regarding CO2 and polymers, another segment of our R&amp;D activities. Getting more out of the existing reservoirs and exploration efforts around the new reservoirs also help to achieve production of 5 million bpd. From an EOR perspective, going from gas injection to water flood should free up quite a lot of gas, which could help achieve ADNOC's gas self-sufficiency target, which is within reach. There is a combination of new gas exploration, and switching from gas injection to water flooding should release some of the gas already injected, potentially developing some of the gas caps that ADNOC has mentioned. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does the IA continue to facilitate the development of the insurance sector, and how does this serve the economy? <br></strong>The IA was established to identify key areas where the UAE insurance sector could develop. The authority formulates strategy and creates a framework to ensure the industry can be brought in line with international standards. Since its inception, the IA has overseen notable successes, such as the implementation of regulatory and supervision laws to increase awareness and the application of training programs. These advancements enhance the ability of IA to work on its mandate. Moreover, it also promotes competitiveness in the local market by providing social and economic protection. The authority has future strategic plans, initiatives, and projects to further this agenda. We aim to safeguard policyholders and insurers in addition to establishing preventive controls to avoid money laundering in insurance activities. This will reduce the likelihood that insurance companies will be exposed to these issues. Additionally, we will roll out a comprehensive campaign to spread insurance awareness among all segments of society. Some of our other strategic plans include increasing mandatory insurance protection for catastrophic risks; organization of reinsurance work; and developing interest in Takaful and marketing insurance policies through banks. Additionally, we wish to create smart applications and focus on innovation in the insurance sector. The UAE's insurance sector is expected to continue as a key driver of economic development and maintain a high rate of growth in the coming years.</p><p><strong>What will be the impact of compulsory health insurances in the UAE's northern Emirates?<br></strong>Health insurance is one of the most important types of insurance that concerns all segments of the population and is compulsory in most countries. Health insurance has been compulsory in Abu Dhabi as of 2006 and in Dubai since 2017. In 2017, health insurance premiums reached AED19.4 billion, representing 43% of the gross written premium. Compulsory health insurance in the UAE will provide insurance protection to the entire population and increase insurance penetration and insurance density (in terms of premiums per capita), which will benefit the UAE's economy and its citizens.</p><p><strong>With around 51% of UAE residents without life insurance, how can awareness of this line be furthered, and what other areas offer significant growth potential? </strong><br>The IA has created incentives to increase the rate of coverage, in particular for business, general, and life insurance. Several new regulations and amendments that seek to create further awareness have contributed to increased marketing of insurance products. Moreover, draft regulations concerning the electronic insurance regulations are in place to encourage marketing of insurance produces on nontraditional channels. Notably, the IA has vast experience in developing insurance awareness through an array of activities that bring a variety of promotional and educational programs to the national audience. For example, we launch insurance awareness campaigns through visual media suitable for all ages and categories of policyholders. Moreover, we have produced short awareness films and broadcasted these through media platforms, cinemas, exhibitions, conferences, and workshops. Similarly, we have created cartoon characters to motivate the public and policyholder's awareness to help drive this message. </p><p><strong>How critical is engagement with insurance leaders when the authority designs regulations, and what new regulations are in the works? <br></strong>The IA is keen to involve the entire insurance sector and relevant stakeholders in consultation whenever new drafts of legislations, regulations, and decisions are being reviewed. Moving forward, the authority has many strategic plans, initiatives, and projects, including newly proposed regulations. These include regulations for the organization of reinsurance operations; the licensing, organization, and control of insurance agents' operations; and the rules of ownership ratios in the capital of insurance companies. Moreover, draft regulations concerning the sharia controller's role in takaful insurance companies operating in the UAE and life insurance activities in the UAE will be examined. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What resources and expertise does OMV bring to the table?<br></strong>Our contribution is all about the kind of technology that we have successfully deployed in other projects in other countries. Our aim is to share knowledge and experience through direct cooperation with ADNOC. The key to success is close cooperation between all partners, in our case ENI, Wintershall-Dea, CEPSA, Lukoil, OMV, and our host ADNOC. Both upstream agreements deal with extremely complex projects that cross the entire technology spectrum, from subsurface geophysics, geology, reservoir engineering, production aspects, drilling to surface facilities and process technologies. In Abu Dhabi, a significant opportunity lies in developing the more complex offshore sour gas in rather tight formations. We have extensive experience in sour gas operations, having worked on it in Austria and Pakistan, and like ADNOC, we have a proven record working with mature and complex reservoirs. While the international average recovery rate for crude oil is about 40%, OMV has succeeded in increasing production rates of wells in the super-mature Matzen field in Austria, pushing ultimate recovery by above 55% by using water injection. In 2012, OMV started a pilot project for viscous saltwater injection in the Matzen field in Austria. In total, 200kboe incremental oil was produced by the end of 2017. OMV is currently pursuing its Smart Oil Recovery 3.0 program by testing a combination of viscous saltwater and alkali to increase ultimate recovery.</p><p><strong>What is Abu Dhabi doing to progress toward gas self-sufficiency and become a net exporter?<br></strong>The UAE now has the sixth largest reserves of oil and gas globally. To achieve gas self-sufficiency and potentially transform the UAE into a net exporter of gas, we are working with our concession partners on the Hail, Ghasha, and Dalma mega-project, which taps into Abu Dhabi's Arab formation, estimated to hold trillions of cbft of recoverable gas. The project is expected to produce more than 1.5 billion cbft of gas per day by 2025.</p><p><strong>How is OMV driving efficiencies, reducing CAPEX, and optimizing assets?<br></strong>In the past three years, we have managed to reduce our production costs by 50%. In 2018, we managed to reduce our production costs to USD7 per barrel. In terms of acquisitions, we have concentrated on regions with low costs and projects that are already up and running or are about to enter production. As a result, our operating cash flow has increased to over EUR4 billion. Notably, we improved the clean CCS Operating Result to EUR3.6 billion in 2018. Digitalization can only work with transformation, hence, its vital to create a digital mindset, reshape the talent landscape, and integrate technology partners and start-ups into the ecosystem. </p><p><strong>What innovative technologies are you currently exploring and deploying across your operations?<br></strong>Innovation and technology are key enablers of the group's strategy. OMV is among the best in the world in terms of achieving high recovery rates in mature fields. OMV focuses on various increased oil recovery and enhanced oil recovery methods. In order to develop a competitive and carbon-optimized portfolio, we actively explore new feedstock, technologies, and products. Close cooperation between OMV experts and external research institutes has yielded impressive results in artificial lift methods, including measurable reductions in power consumption and downtime of sucker rod pumps. In 2017, nearly 6,500 wells were equipped with artificial lift systems, leading to considerable savings in operating expenditures. And we are ready to go one-step further. We want to leverage digital technologies to make smarter investment choices with a high impact. We will innovate at speed and scale to adapt our organization, skills, and mindset to the digital world. We are building unified digital platforms to become a truly data driven company. This journey will open up a whole new world of opportunities, which is why OMV is investing more than EUR500 million in dedicated initiatives and projects to become a digital leader in the oil and gas sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Why is it necessary to have an academy to train future diplomats?<br></strong>The UAE is a country that has made impressive progress in a short period of time. Its sustainability agenda is a prime example. The UAE is also a champion of international solidarity and cooperation and has built a leadership role in security. Understanding and fighting terrorism and countering threats is a significant part of its agenda, and the UAE has participated in practically every NATO initiative, as well as several of the UN initiatives in the Middle East. However, it also understands that prevention is the best security investment. The founding father of the UAE, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, was clear that he did not want his country to merely be an oil producer. He was keen to diversify and invest in the most critical strand of public affairs, human capital. He also wanted the UAE to maintain excellent diplomatic relations and realized early on the merits of soft power. A decision was also recently made to expand the diplomatic network of overseas missions and embassies, both in terms of quantity and quality, given the UAE's desire to develop world-class diplomats for global policy and outreach. To achieve this priority, a specialized academy was required because diplomats need specific skills. </p><p><strong>What fundamental skills make a good diplomat?<br></strong>The world of education in general is shifting toward a balance of skills and knowledge, which is why it is essential to identify the right kind of expertise. Today, we have more access to knowledge than ever, but only a limited capacity to interpret and apply it. If you have the capacity to network, negotiate, persuade, and be successful in the international arena, then the future will be kinder to you. With this rebalancing, we still want people to know the main aspects of diplomacy, but at the same time be good negotiators with a broad skill set that includes different elements such as persuasion and leadership. Indisputably, leadership is an essential skill for those working in embassies and multilateral settings. While team building is crucial, the fact is that you cannot build or get the best from your team if you are not inherently a leader. To be sure, intercultural skills and multilingualism are two final critical skills, which is why our core courses are in Arabic and English and, in addition to six other languages—with plans to expand. </p><p><strong>How do the new regional areas in which the UAE is expanding its diplomatic network factor into your training?<br></strong>Areas such as international cooperation, trade, international investment, and security have gained importance, which means that today's diplomats need to familiarize themselves with all these aspects. Moreover, you also need to have generalists that can double as specialists because in diplomacy, you move seamlessly between different disciplines. Economic and investment diplomacy are new areas of interest. Sometimes the most prestigious companies in the country accompany high political delegations for the signing of trade deals. Some think this is 21st century diplomacy, but it is not. Trade diplomacy was born 4,000 years ago, but today we need to adapt to an unprecedented expansion of the economy. The focus now is less on war and conflict, and more on trade, as well as science, education, and other areas of international cooperation. We have to adapt to a diplomacy oriented toward trade and economy. Diplomacy is present in other sectors of society. We have students coming to us from the private sector as well as major organizations such as Mubadala or Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre, among others. This showcases the increasing importance of diplomacy in less traditional fields. Furthermore, while skills for networking and intercultural understanding are crucial for diplomats, they are equally important in the private sector. As diplomacy becomes more inclusive and global, it will pave the way for more economic exchanges and investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I want to inform the audience here how an international sportsman—a cricketer—ended up in politics. I am from the first generation of Pakistanis, when Pakistan of the 1960s was considered the fastest-growing country in Asia. It was a model of development for the developing world. It was a country with optimism and hope. We grew rapidly, we had an excellent governance system, and our bureaucracy was one of the best in Asia. When I started playing cricket, Pakistan was one of the weakest teams in world cricket. As we were emerging from colonialism, we took great pride as our team became stronger and competed. By the time I left cricket, Pakistan was the world champion. But unfortunately our country could not keep up. The life of a country is in cycles; it is never in a straight line.  </p><p>When I left cricket, I started building the first cancer hospital in Pakistan, because my mother had died of cancer and I realized there was no cancer hospital in the country. People like me who were well off could afford to go for treatment abroad. But what about the common man? Cancer is one of the most expensive treatments, so I started this “movement." When I went out to the public to collect money, I realized that our people are generous and strong. The poorest of the poor supported me. I did what no one ever thought could happen and built the hospital from that public collection. Not only is it built, but 80% of its patients get free treatment. To pay for the running of the hospital, I again went to the people. It is the only private cancer hospital in the world that treats 80% of its patients for free through donations. <br>But I kept thinking, “Why is it that people who are so generous do not pay taxes?" We are a country that is among the top five countries in charitable donations. But we are right at the bottom in paying taxes. The reason was that people did not trust the government. They thought that their taxes were wasted by the government and spent on the ruling elite's lavish lifestyles. So why would people pay taxes? And then, of course, there was corruption. <br>But there was a third reason why I ended up in politics. When I played professional cricket in England, half my year was spent in England and half in Pakistan. I saw how a developed country and its institutions worked, why they moved ahead, how governments were accountable, and how meritocracy worked. Above all, there was human development —money was spent on human beings. <br>I also saw other countries develop, and one of them was the UAE. I played cricket in the UAE from 1980 onward, and I saw that the UAE kept on developing. Then, afterwards, I saw China develop. The common thread in all the countries that have gone ahead is governance. Governance has two aspects. One is that a government has to be accountable. The more accountable and clean a government is, the more successful it is. The second is meritocracy. The better the system for getting the best talent to the top, the better the country. Let me give you a sporting example. Australia is the most successful cricket country in cricket's history of over 200 years because Australia has the best system of bringing its talent up. Pakistan has the greatest talent out of all the countries I have played, but we do not have a system to bring that talent up. What is the point of having great talent if you do not have a system of meritocracy that helps to bring that talent up? That mentality should apply to every field. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As-salÄmu alaykum! Peace be with you!<br>With a heart grateful to the Lord, in this eighth centenary of the meeting between Saint Francis of Assisi and Sultan al-Malik al KÄmil, I have welcomed the opportunity to come here as a believer thirsting for peace, as a brother seeking peace with the brethren. We are here to desire peace, to promote peace, and to be instruments of peace.<br>The logo of this journey depicts a dove with an olive branch. It is an image that recalls the story—present in different religious traditions—of the primordial flood. According to the biblical account, in order to preserve humanity from destruction, God asked Noah to enter the ark along with his family. Today, we too in the name of God, in order to safeguard peace, need to enter together as one family into an ark that can sail the stormy seas of the world: the ark of fraternity.<br>The point of departure is the recognition that God is at the origin of the one human family. He who is the Creator of all things and of all persons wants us to live as brothers and sisters, dwelling in the common home of creation that he has given us. Fraternity is established here at the roots of our common humanity, as “a vocation contained in God's plan of creation." This tells us that all persons have equal dignity and that no one can be a master or slave of others.<br>We cannot honor the Creator without cherishing the sacredness of every person and of every human life: each person is equally precious in the eyes of God, who does not look upon the human family with a preferential gaze that excludes, but with a benevolent gaze that includes. Thus, to recognize the same rights for every human being is to glorify the name of God on earth. In the name of God the Creator, therefore, every form of violence must be condemned without hesitation, because we gravely profane God's name when we use it to justify hatred and violence against a brother or sister. No violence can be justified in the name of religion.<br>I wish to express appreciation for the commitment of this nation to tolerating and guaranteeing freedom of worship, to confronting extremism and hatred. Even as the fundamental freedom to profess one's own beliefs is promoted—this freedom being an intrinsic requirement for a human being's self-realization—we need to be vigilant lest religion be instrumentalized and deny itself by allowing violence and terrorism. There is no alternative: we will either build the future together or there will not be a future. Religions, in particular, cannot renounce the urgent task of building bridges between peoples and cultures. The time has come when religions should more actively exert themselves, with courage and audacity, and without pretense, to help the human family deepen the capacity for reconciliation, the vision of hope and the concrete paths of peace.</p><p><strong>Education and Justice<br></strong>Education means in Latin “extracting, drawing out." It is to bring to light the precious resources of the soul. It is comforting to note how in this country investments are being made not only in the extraction of the earth's resources, but also in those of the heart, in the education of young people. It is a commitment that I hope will continue and spread elsewhere. Education also happens in a relationship, in reciprocity. Alongside the famous ancient maxim “know yourself," we must uphold “know your brother or sister:" their history, their culture, and their faith, because there is no genuine self-knowledge without the other. As human beings, and even more so as brothers and sisters, let us remind each other that nothing of what is human can remain foreign to us. It is important for the future to form open identities capable of overcoming the temptation to turn in on oneself and become rigid.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of Al Ain Club Investment Company and its strategic priorities?<br></strong>The Al Ain Club Investment Company represents the operations and commercial and investment arm of Al Ain Club. Under our core mandate, we focus on building, managing, and operating athletic assets. We also support Al Ain Club's investments, operations and commercial activities. Al Ain Club is the most successful domestic football club in the UAE and the only Emirati club to win the Asian Champion League. We recently witnessed the overall brand value increase significantly after playing Real Madrid in the Club World Cup in 2018. Much of the success of the club's entire operation depends on how the first team is performing. If it performs well, this is reflected in match day attendance and further opportunities for the club to capture a wider fan base. The team's overall performance has been down this year in comparison with recent years. We have brought in new players and signed new contracts with existing players. We are now starting to observe an increase in the level of performance of the whole team, which will eventually pave the way to achieve remarkable results.</p><p><strong>What has been the enduring impact of the Asian Cup and the Special Olympics World Games, and how can Al Ain Club Investment Company build on the momentum of these events to capture further opportunities?<br></strong>The Special Olympics brings together 7,500 participants from 190 nations. What these events have demonstrated to a global audience is that the UAE has the infrastructure and expertise to host major events. While it is obvious that we have the sports infrastructure, a major consideration was hotels, transportation, and security. In many cases, Special Olympics athletes require special resources and amenities. Over a year of preparation, we consulted with organizers from the previous Special Olympics and the 7,500 athletes, along with their delegations and families. We then anticipated the effect on hotels, malls, and transportation. The Asian Cup also had a remarkable impact. Overall, we hosted 24 teams with a match every two days. We had fans coming from outside the UAE to support their national team, as well as a significant portion of fans from participating countries who are expatriate residents in the UAE. With extensive coverage of such events and high viewership numbers, there was a marked increase in brand value. Inevitably, the UAE will continue to host an array of global sporting events.</p><p><strong>What further potential do sports facilities have as a form of revenue generation?<br></strong>Hazza bin Zayed Stadium, for example, usually hosts around 31 matches per year. Maintenance for the stadium is costly, so this raises an important question of what we should do for the remainder of the year. We have an ever-growing non-football related events calendar. To develop and diversify, we can hold events like weddings and business meetings. We now hold festivals in the stadium, and these events have increased engagement with the local community. Furthermore, we allow schools to tour the stadium. The stadium can be transformed quikly to accommodate various sports and concerts. While there are opportunities, a major challenge is the climate, with the summer proving difficult for outdoor activity.</p><p><strong>What do you think is the future of private investment and sustainability in the sports sector?<br></strong>The government wants to stop funding the clubs, but unfortunately, there is not much room for private-sector investment. The club is one of the biggest aspects of a community. Its role is to engage children and help them do something productive and athletic. The private sector can sponsor activities that promote sporting engagement across our communities. Our experience from previous events is something on which to capitalize. Together, this will pave the way and push forward the country's economy, making it a leading economy and establishing its position firmly worldwide. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What role does SCMAF play in the social development agenda of Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>SCMAF serves vulnerable Emirati families in Abu Dhabi. We fall under the auspices of the Abu Dhabi Department of Social Development, and we have become one of the major social development players in the Emirate. Families usually come under our care through a decision from the court, and SCMAF's responsibilities differ from family to family. We try to categorize them according to their level of stability. Instability can include sickness, addiction, or discipline issues. If, for example, it is a challenge for the mother to look after the children, we consider it an unstable situation, which is not a negative category, but it requires more attention. We frequently visit these families and connect them to different departments, such as the Department of Health or Education. Sometimes we meet families with children dealing with addiction or abuse. Our social workers meet the families, conduct analysis, and then implement clear solutions that might involve things like medication or perhaps meditation. We focus a lot on mothers, trying to give them more support or educating them on how to support their children. We encourage them to report to us and be proactive. SCMAF runs sessions with families in need, and the number of sessions required can vary. Some people are afraid to be put on the spot, so we try to make them as comfortable as possible. The number of successful cases is growing. It is extremely important to emphasize that we not only care for individuals as minors, but when they are grown adults, too. The minors whom we work with must be made ready for adult life in this society.</p><p><strong>What are some of the crucial needs for young people in Abu Dhabi in terms of social support?<br></strong>I try to make my team at SCMAF understand that we will not be able to take over the role of a parent in a child's life. Many of the children we work with have a gap in their lives that they expect to be filled in the way they were previously used to. If, for example, a father has passed away and left his son AED1 million, and the courts ask us to manage it, our goal is not to use the money to give the son whatever he wants, but rather to take that AED1 million, invest it or manage it wisely and get the son to a point where he can take over his finances in a mature way. Wealth management, particularly in cases of premature death or inheritance disputes, is a significant part of what we do at SCMAF. Sometimes it is difficult to convince our younger beneficiaries about the importance of money management because many young people have difficulty seeing beyond their immediate needs or desires. The Emirati youth today are accustomed to a different standard of living than in the past. It is a challenge to please everyone. This is something on which SCMAF works particularly closely with mothers.</p><p><strong>How is SCMAF using technology to revolutionize its services?<br></strong>Almost all of SCMAF's services are available online, though that is not the metric with which I am most concerned. Our goal is to make our services accessible to the people who really need us. Most minors are using some sort of device, so our online presence is useful, though it will take time to see how children use it to report to us in instances where they cannot go through a teacher or parent. Part of that process is educating parents to give their children the space to evaluate their own environment and behave responsibly. We also have to bear in mind that there are many vulnerable people who do not have the knowledge or access to online services, and we have to be available for them as well. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why was 2019 a successful year for Mundo Cuervo, and how have you continued this success in 2020?</h4><p>While 2020 will be considered unprecedented in all senses, 2019 was the best year to date for Mundo Cuervo and a welcome continuation of progress for the destination. The main goal of Mundo Cuervo is to promote the destination of Tequila in a sustainable way and contribute to the quality of life of its residents, by supporting the economic, social, and environmental development of the region. In this sense, our greatest achievement of 2019 was to see the fruits of over 15 years of labor come to fruition. We achieved the highest number of visitors to date and were able to support our local residents with employment opportunities, cultural events, and city-wide festivals, all which acted together further the appreciation of the magical town of Tequila. In addition, Mundo Cuervo is contributing to certify Tequila as the first smart tourist destination in Mexico.</p><h4>How many visitors did you receive in 2019, and how does this compare to previous years?</h4><p>2019 was a banner year for Mundo Cuervo, with a total of 191,398 visitors from January to December, up 2.5% over 2018. Of the six experiences of Mundo Cuervo—including two hotels, the distillery, events center, cultural center, and the train—our most solid attractions continue to be the Jose Cuervo Express Train, which transports over 34,000 travelers each year, and the La Rojeña Distillery, which welcomed close to 140,000 visitors in 2019. One of the most exciting advances for the destination was the consolidation of La Hacienda el Centenario as the premier convention and events location for the region, which carried out around 25,000 people in 2019. On top of this, in its first full year of operation, the Juan Beckmann Gallardo Cultural Center received over 9,000 visitors to its installations.</p><h4>What strategies is Mundo Cuervo using to adapt to COVID-19?</h4><p>Our main strategy is sustainability. We reacted to the ever-changing needs of the COVID-19 crisis by banding together closely with federal, state, and international authorities to ensure we move lockstep in response. To ensure the safety of our community and the residents of Tequila, we adopted all security and sanitization measures to reduce transmission of the virus—including closing down attractions for tourists and the hotels—and have supported the local community at every opportunity possible. Starting in March, and coinciding with the closure of our installations to the public, Mundo Cuervo also adopted a new communication strategy focused on the desire to continue to dream about travel. In our social media posts and online, Mundo Cuervo offers inspiration to and encourages travelers everywhere to continue to dream and lets them know we are working to welcome them back, as soon as that is possible. Finally, Mundo Cuervo is actively working with the authorities and other tourism entities to develop the best re-opening strategy possible. Following global and national mandates, Mundo Cuervo will fully reassess its operations protocols to ensure the safety of the community and its visitors. We will also take a careful look at the quality of our experiences and the level of safety we can offer our guests instead of focusing on the quantity and volume of visitors.</p><h4>What main projects are you prioritizing for investment in the first part of 2020?</h4><p>Instead of investing in new installations, in 1Q2020 Mundo Cuervo focused on the maintenance of the current offering. The fall in visitors has allowed us to complete the scheduled reforms quickly and will allow us to reopen with a fully refreshed offering. While future investments will depend on how fast tourism recovers as an industry, we are preparing ourselves in everything that has to do with quality management, hygiene, and safety for the visitor. In addition, we reaffirm our full commitment to our community and Tequila and look forward to continuing to develop the destination as we move forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>In what terms would you describe MRM's commitment to development and sustainability in Mozambique?</h4><p>MRM operates the Montepuez ruby deposit in Cabo Delgado. It is 75% owned by Gemfields and 25% by Mozambican company Mwiriti. Covering approximately 33,600ha, it is believed to be the most significant recently discovered ruby deposit in the world. MRM believes rubies belong to Mozambique and that we must structure the gemstone industry to maximize profits generated by the country's resources, while ensuring we bring in the maximum amount of money into the country. MRM aspires to be the guardian of Mozambique's rubies, operating them responsibly, transparently, and ethically, involving the government in all processes, all while contributing positively to the national economy and taking a leading role in modernizing the colored gemstone sector and building sustainable livelihoods for our communities. Since the beginning of our operation, MRM has invested a total of USD241 million as part of our commitment to CSR and the development of Mozambique. Part of this investment went toward community development projects, establishing schools with a combined capacity of 2,000 students, funding the vocational training of 2,100 local youths, providing two mobile clinics that supply medical services to 10 local communities, and supporting farming associations for 400 farmers in local communities. We also support biodiversity conservation in Quirimbas National Park and the Niassa National Reserve. We have also committed USD7 million to the development of the RAP village (resettlement of 105 families from Nthoro village) to limit as much as possible the negative consequences of our project. RAP is our priority project and will be completed as scheduled, although the handover might be delayed by a month to July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the recent health pandemic, the company has focused on the implementation of health programs with a structured approach focus on mental health to address health issues likely to cause anxiety and stress for our employees and their families. A hygiene and illness prevention program encourages taking primary measures of disease prevention to protect ourselves and others from becoming ill and defining infection-control methods to prevent the spread of contagious diseases in our camp accommodations.</p><br><h4></h4><h4>In what way do rubies extracted in Mozambique stand out on the global scale?</h4><p>The discovery of rubies in Mozambique in 2009 was a real gamechanger. Rubies from different origins often have distinctive hues, but Mozambican rubies were formed about 500 million years ago and span all known color ranges, including the rarest pure fluorescent reds. Mozambique has fast become the world's number-one ruby exporter, yielding record-breaking auction results for Gemfields. Following US-led bans on rubies from Myanmar in 2008, Mozambique's consistency and transparency of supply has instilled renewed confidence in rubies and enabled high-end jewelry brands to create extraordinary capsule collections with fine rubies they would typically have spent years collecting.</p><h4>After a few years of increased stability, MRM witnessed episodes of disorders and illegal mining in February 2020. What role can MRM play in mitigating the social tensions that trigger such events?</h4><p>In 2020, MRM has been increasingly invaded by illegal miners, sometimes culminating in fatalities, due to the collapse of the pits where they illegally conduct mining activity. MRM continues to work closely with Mozambican authorities to raise awareness among local communities of the dangers of artisanal mining and to assist in tackling ruby smuggling and reduce the risk to, and exploitation of, vulnerable groups by well-organized syndicates. MRM has undertaken steps to reduce the amount of illegal mining activity, by providing humanitarian assistance in rescue and recovery operations and committing to immediately report any accident to all stakeholders at both district, provincial and national levels. We have increased on-site signage warning of the dangers of illegal mining and campaigned to raise awareness among the local communities and government officials to assist in tackling the issue.</p><h4>How will your strategy be affected by the current COVID-19 crisis?</h4><p>The current COVID-19 pandemic will undoubtedly affect MRM's financial performance in 2020. Due to widespread travel restrictions, the mixed quality auction scheduled for June 2020 is likely to be rescheduled, which may result in one single auction in 4Q2020. All but critical operations at MRM have been suspended as April 22. The well-being of MRM's employees and communities remains the overriding priority. Security, maintenance, and other essential services will continue in order to ensure MRM is well placed to resume normal operations as soon as it is safe and practicable to do so. MRM has also suspended all expansionary capital expenditure for the foreseeable future, including the second treatment plant with an estimated expenditure of USD12 million.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2020?</h4><p>Without factoring in the COVID-19 pandemic, MRM'S objectives for 2020 are to increase carat production from 2,260.7kcts in 2019 to 5,400kcts in 2020, participate in more auctions, and increase our staff members to 709 by December 2020. Our long-term vision is to be the global leader in precious colored gemstones, promoting transparency, trust, and responsible mining practices. Our approach has always been progressive and unconventional. We are a young, dynamic company and support raw emerging talent. We seek to do things differently and maintain a considered balance between people, profit, and the environment.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is COVID-19 affecting Mozambique's economic recovery?</h4><p>I foresee a multi-faceted negative impact of COVID-19 on Mozambique's economy. The first concern is the global impact of the pandemic. As countries across the globe are implementing lockdown measures, forecasts point to a 3% shrinkage in the global economy, while the IMF predicts a 1.6% contraction in the economy of the Southern African region. The effects on Mozambique will be even stronger, given that the country went through a traumatic 2019 due to the cyclones; while early forecasts in 2020 predicted growth above 5%, now even 2% growth forecasts are judged as too optimistic. Mozambique has limited fiscal space and high public debt; the country has been urgently advised to undergo a process of fiscal consolidation and control of public expenditures; however, expenditures to limit the impact of COVID-19 will put more pressure on the public debt. Fortunately, the IMF has agreed to limit the damages by granting a USD300-million loan to stabilize Mozambique's balance of payments for the moment. However, COVID-19 is slowing down FDI in the country, and without investment the country will not have the means to push through fiscal consolidation in the coming years. Mozambique was keenly awaiting USD30-billion gas investments from ExxonMobil in 1H2020; however, it now looks like it will be delayed for a year, due to the ongoing uncertainty in the market. Overall, it is clear that economic recovery will not be seen in 2020.</p><h4>How is the banking sector assisting the country during this crisis?</h4><p>The banking sector is fundamental for the development of the economy and should play a crucial role during moments of crisis. At the offset of the outbreak, the central bank took a set of initiatives to assist the economy, and the whole banking sector was keen to abide. This included lowering interest rates by 150 base points and injecting additional liquidity in the market, in both local and foreign currency. Financial institutions have come together to deploy a series of measures to minimize the impact in the medium and long term, such as the delay in terms of payments for interests and, in some cases, capital. These measures will have a significant impact in relieving the debts of companies and individual borrowers, as well as benefitting new credit. However, these should not be long-term solutions, as lowering interest rates risks increasing inflation rates and prompting currency devaluation—a situation Mozambique witnessed all too recently and does not wish to relive. Besides acting on monetary policies, banks have taken actions to benefit customers, such as lowering banking service fees and encouraging the use of digital platforms—a crucial measure in the context of social distancing.</p><h4>What measures has Millennium BIM put in place to face the challenges brought by COVID-19?</h4><p>Our first concern is to protect our employees and our clients, ensuring the use of masks, disinfectants, and social distancing measures. We have split our employees into shifts, allowing a third of our employees to work from home. Our second concern is business continuity—the bank must continue to operate, and its services need to remain available to the public. We have implemented all the necessary safety measures while ensuring the necessary services we provide are not disrupted. In terms of corporate social responsibility (CSR), a priority for Millennium BIM has been to assist the country concretely in the fight against COVID-19. We cancelled the celebrations for our 25th anniversary in October and have allocated MZN15 million to Maputo Central Hospital, the largest public hospital in the country, which finds itself at the forefront of the fight. The hospital lacks rooms and equipment, so through this contribution we want to enable the hospital to have a more positive response to attend affected patients.</p><h4>Given the current challenges, what changes do you envisage in your 2020 strategy?</h4><p>COVID-19 has undoubtedly influenced our strategy, but in a way, we have been able to transform the challenge into an opportunity. The first aspect is digital transformation. This period of confinement has shown us that we must emphasize the digital connection with our clients. We already have a successful digital platform called IZI, though we are determined to improve our efforts in mobile technology and move to online customer care. This crisis has shown us that people can be extremely productive working from home, and with well-defined KPIs and indicators, we can make evaluations based on outputs. This will have a huge impact on the way we do business. On a more negative note, a central pillar of our 2020 strategy was to assist the gas mega-project ecosystem and the development of local content. Delays in the gas projects will thus represent a setback in our strategy. However, due to the financial crisis in Mozambique over the past few years, Millennium BIM has developed an extraordinary level of liquidity reinforcing its capital (at an astounding 45%). The strong liquidity and robustness of our balance gives us confidence that we will overcome this pandemic, while always ensuring we protect our workers and clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of investing in the mining sector in Ecuador compared to other markets in Latin America?</h4><p>There are many things SolGold finds appealing about Ecuador, one of which is the willingness of the government. Another is the increasing acceptance by Ecuadorians of just how much time, effort, and money it takes to discover and then properly appraise a find because a large sum of capital has to go into the next stage, which is development, then mining. Ecuador's economy and the standard of living of all Ecuadorians can be greatly improved by the delivery of a safe, responsible, and inclusive mining industry. SolGold understands we are guests in Ecuador, and we want to be regarded as an important part of the local economic and social framework and culture. We are putting in great effort into making sure the government and people understand we will be here for the long term. The exploration activities we necessarily need to undertake to discover these ore bodies first will be carried out sensitively and inclusively, making sure we employ and involve as many Ecuadorians as possible. We will do this safety and apply an environmental standard of care that is at the top of the global standards. From an exploration risk point of view, Ecuador is a virtually unexplored 700-km long section of the world's richest copper belt—the Andean Copper Belt—and it was not surprising when we found an ore body at Cascabel, the Alpala deposit. There could well be more on the Cascabel license. Some of the great porphyry ore bodies in Chile are up to 10 times bigger than Alpala. Therefore, Alpala can get bigger yet, and it might be just the first of maybe 10 deposits throughout the Ecuadorian Andeans.</p><h4>What strategies does SolGold use to mitigate the risks of being a first mover in a country like Ecuador?</h4><p>We use several strategies, the first of which is social and environmental. We put a great deal of time and effort into ensuring we are accepted by the local community. We demonstrated this in the Cascabel area, where we employ 700 Ecuadorians. We expect to replicate that in other areas as we start to look more intensively at some of our projects through the rest of the country. We have identified other places with the same signatures throughout Ecuador. There are companies with exploration projects, like Lumina Gold, Luminex, Cornerstone, BHP, Icarus, and so on, though none have gone in with an entire country mega-structural and mega-geochemical filtering strategy like us. It is fairly conceivable that as SolGold grows, we could have 10 exploration and appraisal projects going on at once. Our aim is to ultimately have several tier-one copper-gold mines operating in Ecuador and make Ecuador the greatest copper-producing nation on earth. That goal is achievable within 20 years, though it will take a focused and coordinated effort between industry and the government departments and a great deal of understanding by the people. The government also has to be careful that the groups it hands licenses out to will do the work and act responsibly. We are grateful to Lundin Gold for its gold-silver project at Fruta del Norte in a sensitive area. It has done that project smoothly, on time, and on budget, which endorses the claim that Ecuador is a great place to explore and develop mines. However, we recognize the industry now must be careful to retain and protect that reputation.</p><h4>How much do you plan to invest in your Cascabel project until it starts producing?</h4><p>Between now and the completion of the feasibility study, including regional exploration, we expect to spend approximately USD150 million. The development of the Cascabel project will take around USD2.7 billion. The project will start at about 20 million tons per year and build up to 50 million tons per year. It will hit peak production in year 14. We currently plan to start production in mid-2025. Ecuador's share of the benefits from the mine will be around USD17 billion. If we can have five projects working under the SolGold banner over the next 20 years, we can deliver in excess of USD80 billion a year in extra income for Ecuador, which will completely change everything for Ecuadorians.</p><h4>What is your main source for acquiring more capital pre-production?</h4><p>Because of the high nature of the income toward the front-end of the project, it suits debt funding well. We are making great progress at the moment in discussions with mining financiers around the world, particularly from a debt funding point of view. Global economic conditions suggest we will have lower interest rates for longer than we thought, which endorses debt funding as a route to funding the USD2.7 billion development. All these sums need to be refined through the pre-feasibility study and the definitive feasibility study. We hope to have the definitive feasibility study out after 2Q2021, after which we hope to be in construction within nine months. The quicker we can deliver a result for Ecuador, the quicker Ecuador and Ecuadorians will see this is a great thing for the country and help us to help them through all the other projects throughout the country.</p><h4>The mining industry is still relatively new in Ecuador compared to other markets in Latin America. What will be SolGold's main contribution to the consolidation of this market?</h4><p>The greatest legacy any company can leave for a new mining nation is increased education and standard of living, which is what SolGold is focused on doing. If we can do that, we will have become important to Ecuadorians and Ecuador. In terms of assisting with consolidation, because of the big pipeline and the vast array of other projects we have in play, we have a huge amount to get on with on the ground. We do not see ourselves being part of any corporate consolidation. We have such a huge asset base that we just need to get on with the job of discovering, developing, and mining ore bodies. Our hands are full. We are also building our management and mine construction teams. I am confident we will discover many ore bodies once we get going. The project areas that really stand out to us currently are Chical, Rio, Amarillo, Sharug, Porvenir, La Hueca 6, Chillanes, and Cisne Loja. But we have around 13 priority project areas in Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has Colombia represented in your portfolio of operations?</h4><p>Launched at the end of 2018, Colombia is one of our newest and most exciting offices, given that Colombia inspired the BMI Companies' founder to set up his own company. Our outlook on the market is positive; Colombia has one of the best growth trajectories in the region. The country is also politically stable, with a growing middle class and share of individual life policies with respect to GDP, providing a huge opportunity to penetrate the local market. In a few years, we expect our operations here will represent the biggest market for BMI. Currently, our largest market is Ecuador, where we now have three local offices: Cuenca, Guayaquil, and Quito.</p><h4>After different alliances, how have users managed to expand their range of insurance service options?</h4><p>We are constantly working to improve the experience of our customers. This translates into strategic alliances that allow focusing on greater insight and greater knowledge. How do we do it? A fundamental pillar is collaborative synergies to complement services based on each company's know-how and specialty. We are looking for business partners to jointly leverage sales with the single purpose of strengthening the value proposition. There are ways to penetrate the market and expand the knowledge of our products. Another equally important way is through continued training of advisors on our products. Finally, our suppliers become a strategic ally, as they are responsible for service to our customers. This means that well-made agreements, constant monitoring, and supervision are fundamental pieces in guaranteeing our valued products.</p><h4>How do you plan to launch new products in the individual life and health segment?</h4><p>In 2019, BMI Colombia launched different products, including Universal Individual Life — NOVA. The Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia was also authorized for the new life group product, and we adapted the individual health product to the local market with local coverage to meet customers' needs. Before creating entirely new products, it is important to look at current BMI products and see how they can be revised for the Colombian market. Our focus has to be on improving processes to achieve the best response and quality for our sellers and customers. We are constantly looking for new opportunities for this market, and when we do, we implement them immediately once they have been deemed viable by our technical and marketing departments.</p><h4>What is your percentage breakdown between personal and corporate policies?</h4><p>For us, the individual and corporate market are completely different, but they complement each other, strategically speaking. Currently, our corporate participation is greater than the individual. The individual segment tends to have a slower growth trajectory than the corporate one. In the medium term, it will balance out.</p><h4>When it comes to premium and corporate services, how do you ensure you attract the right customers and future partnerships?</h4><p>We have clear product segmentation, and we know exactly what the profile of our clients is, both individual and corporate. These profiles are constantly transmitted to our sales force. Meanwhile, all our strategic clients go through a strict filter and risk analysis process, ensuring they are in line with our company standards.</p><h4>After a direct investment of USD28 million, how have you managed to increase direct job generation? How does this contribute to actions of corporate social responsibility?</h4><p>As a young and growing company in the Colombian market, we have increased our direct job placements by at least 70%. Our human resources department continues searching for additional personnel, as demand continues to increase due to our commercial sales growth. As the sales force grows, we continue to hire in the operational and administrative departments to best support our personnel in the commercial areas. Today, we have more than 300 independent consultants with whom we have delivered excellent insurance plans.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are KPI and KUFPEC's growth strategy in new and emerging markets?</h4><p>KPI's direction in new and emerging markets is to expand and grow its refining and marketing operations, the aim of which is to create value for our shareholder, KPC. We will explore the full potential of the value chain from upstream to midstream and downstream. As you know, we are partners at a refinery in Vietnam that was commissioned in November last year and is producing 200,000 bpd and takes 100% of that crude from Kuwait, and produces refined products that are sold to the Vietnamese market. We have also partnered with Oman to build another refinery in Duqm with a capacity of 230,000 bpd and that will be another home for Kuwaiti crude. Each of those refineries will have a petrochemical project within it. Our strategy is to have an integrated refinery with petchem in all of our new investments. As for KUFPEC, our current portfolio consists of 44 assets distributed across 13 countries, and includes five operated exploration assets in Pakistan, Indonesia and Australia. In 2019, we produced more than 108 mboepd supported by YE 2019 2P reserves of 450 mmboe, and our updated strategy is to take KUFPEC to a mid-size exploration and production company. The exploration success we recently had in Malaysia may lead to the growth of a new production and reserves hub. The exploration well Lang Lebah-1RDR2 in SK410B encountered 252 m of net gas pay. Preliminary estimates show three TCF of Resources, which is equivalent to 536 mmboe (gross) and 115 mmboe (net). KUFPEC has shown resilience despite oil market volatility, and looking forward, we will continue to optimize our portfolio to meet our commitments to our shareholder and unlock value for Kuwait.</p><h4>Both KPI and KUFPEC have had a successful run of establishing and managing joint venture projects in several continents. What makes them the optimal partner for a JV?</h4><p>Both KPI and KUFPEC bring the might of our shareholder, KPC, to the negotiating table, which provides secure, reliable, stable access to Kuwaiti crude. Both companies have a long track record of successful partnerships and JVs spanning decades. This is because our values are built on fostering and sustaining relationships that enhance our growth and operational excellence. We are also dedicated to a drive towards continuous improvement, in addition to our unwavering commitment to the highest standards of ethics. For KUFPEC, we look for IOC or NOC partners that will help us continue to optimize our existing portfolio through operational excellence and focus on attractive acquisitions, while for KPI, we focus on partners in high growth captive markets that complement our portfolio. Irrespective of commercial focus, both companies provide their JVs with a trusted, stable, reliable business partner.</p><h4>Digitalization is a key element of the innovative business model that KPI and KUFPEC pursue. What key initiatives are they currently undertaking to digitalize its new investments?</h4><p>KPI has formulated a digital roadmap, designed to synchronize its business to the digital revolution. Projects undertaken to achieve the strategy include investments in smart systems, payment solutions, and digital marketing. Meanwhile, KUFPEC's diversified portfolio (includes Offshore, LNG, and Unconventional operations) enjoys strengths in technology and know-how. For example, in offshore drilling, we work with our sister company, KOC (Kuwait Oil Company), to help them apply our knowledge in Kuwait.</p><h4>Outside of its large-scale operational investments, KPI is also working to digitalize its consumer-facing business through its digital payments systems. What goals has KPI set for adoption of digital payments through its different direct services?</h4><p>Digital payments are a fundamental part of the KPI Digital roadmap. It will certainly improve our customer proposition. The ultimate goal is to attract new customers to our stations and retain our current customer base with loyal schemes. For example, one of our customer-centric, mobile payment solutions in Belgium, the Q8Smiles app, allows motorists to pay for their fuel and shopping from the comfort of their car. It also offers them rewards from third-party vendors through the collection of 'smiles' by visiting our stations. Similar projects are in the pipeline in Italy.</p><h4>KPI has recently been expanding its retail operations. Can you outline KPI's growth strategy for retail?</h4><p>KPI's strategy focuses on growing its retail outlets in new markets while enhancing its sustainable position in Europe mature markets where our brand is strong and well recognized. Last year, we closed major acquisitions of retail stations in Spain and Belgium. We believe the growth will be in the coming years; on the other hand, the main theme for our fuel retailing operations in mature markets such as Europe is innovation and sustainability. The Q8 brand is the most noticeable and internationally known brand within the KPC family of brands. Tell us more about what it represents as a Company, and what it means to your customers and partners. KPI is the international downstream arm of our shareholder, KPC, which is one of the biggest National Oil Companies in the world. Our distinctive Q8 brand reflects our shareholders' maritime heritage; the sails symbolizing the Arab dhow while the colours yellow, red, and blue symbolise the desert, sun, and sea.To our customers, this translates to quality and a history of service. To our partners, it means stability and reliability. Our brand is a reflection of Kuwaiti business operations abroad, and it is our role to enhance our national reputation in the international market, and to continue to show our customers and partners that we are easy to do business with, especially with support from KPC.</p><h4>How do KPI and KUFPEC bring their international experience to the family of K-Companies?</h4><p>We provide international development opportunities for young Kuwaiti professionals to be trained with oil majors, so they can hone their skills and bring back that expertise to us. KUFPEC has been working on several opportunities that can provide operational, financial, legal or commercial synergistic value to the KPC Group of companies and continues to find new innovative ways to leverage what we've learned from our portfolio for KPC. In 2019, KUFPEC provided 31 opportunities for training and capability building to oil sector employees by providing secondment to KUFPEC Area Offices and JV Partners. As for KPI, we have Kuwaitis leading several of our operating units abroad in Europe and our JVs in Asia, the total numbering surpassing 60 employees.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the new trends that you are working on?</h4><p>In Morocco, we have developed an energy strategy in which renewable energies take a prominent place, thanks to the strategic vision of His Majesty King Mohammed VI in 2009. Our 2020 goal aims for 42% of our electrical capacity to come from solar, wind, and hydraulic sources; the objective by 2030 is 52%. ONHYM as a public organization representing the interests of the Kingdom of Morocco in the field of Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons and Mining resources has also the mission to search for all the energy potentials of subsoil and geothermal energy. Concerning geothermal sources, for several years now we have done evaluation studies on the whole country, and we have identified two large areas: Morocco's northeast and south. In the northeast, detailed studies have been carried out to identify the most favorable zones for geothermal energy. We have done a survey of all the potential pockets in the area that will undergo more refined work, since further drilling is necessary to precisely measure some parameters. In the south, meanwhile, the studies are in their first stages; we are making an inventory of all the potential geothermal areas that will have an impact on industrial development.</p><h4>Why is geothermal energy efficient for the country? </h4><p>As a renewable energy source, geothermal energy is an underground source that does not emit CO2, making it sustainable as an energy source. There are countries in northern Europe like Finland that produce almost 70% of their electricity from geothermal sources. Of course, they have much higher temperature gradients there, but we are looking into all the potential sources. It is an ongoing process, and we will see results later as we go deeper into the data. We need more drilling to measure the gradients in some areas in detail, and we will move forward gradually to make sure that this energy can find a place if the results are convincing.</p><h4>You signed six petroleum agreements with international companies in 2019. What are the investment opportunities that the country is offering to these international investors?</h4><p>ONHYM's mission is to attract the maximum number of international companies, majors, juniors and independents to support exploration, which is one of our main missions, alongside promotion. Most of the investments in the field of hydrocarbon exploration in Morocco are made by partners. Looking at investment figures, more than 96% is financed by foreign investors every year. These numbers are due to multiple reasons. One is that Morocco has favorable geology in sedimentary basins, but these have not been sufficiently explored despite the efforts made. Second is our hydrocarbons code, which is considered one of the most attractive in the world: we grant favorable conditions to those investing in exploration including exemptions from customs duties and VAT on important equipment, exemption of corporate tax up to 10 years from the date of production; In case of discovery, the partner owns 75%. A third point is our global macroeconomic framework in terms of political security and geographical positioning. In this North African zone, we are close to Europe, the Middle East, the US, and sub-Saharan Africa. This interesting geographical position makes us a hub in the energy sector. We, therefore, wish to use this position to increase our regional integration.</p><h4>What is going to be the role of ONHYM in the future if there is a shift towards more renewable sources of energy?</h4><p>The goal for 2030 is 52% of the installed capacity to be from renewable sources. The country's energy strategy has four fundamentals: the country's supply security; energy's availability at the best price; regional integration; sustainable development and environmental protection. In order to have energy security, we need a diversified electricity mix where all sources have their place. We are engaged in an energy transition where renewable energies will be positioned more in our mix, but we also had to build new clean coal power plants to ensure the balance and security of the country 10 years ago when there was no gas available for us. Since 2010 with the shale gas revolution, gas is more available. In any case, in the energy transition, whether it be global, regional, or national, gas is considered to be the backbone of the energy mix of today and tomorrow. Today more than 80% of the global energy sources are thermal, meaning coal, oil, and gas. The rest is split between nuclear and renewable energy. In 2040, 74% of this mix will still be thermal energy. Looking at the fossil fuels portfolio, coal will decrease and oil will decrease, but gas will increase as it is considered clean energy. Therefore, despite the green revolution, thermal energies are still predominant but with a stronger emphasis on gas. ONHYM's mission is to explore underground to identify potential sources of gas or oil. Morocco is totally committed to the dynamic of sustainable development deriving from the Royal will and vision that is being implemented. However, it does not stop us from looking for potential gas resources, because it is also an important resource in this ongoing energy transformation. At the same time, we will continue to seek out other substances such as geothermal sources. The Moroccan energy strategy, while being ambitious, remains realistic by being part of global energy trends in the long term and taking into account the real potential of Morocco. ONHYM, as an operator in hydrocarbons, promotes the use of natural gas, which is clean energy and essential for balancing the energy mix with renewable energies. We have regions that have potential. Many areas have oil or gas shows (Gharb, Essaouira, Tendrara). The discoveries are modest but it allow replenishment of reserves and assure our customers a continuity of gas supply.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There has been a shift in demand in the tourism sector. How would you define this shift?</h4><p>Indeed, this shift has happened both in the business and the leisure segment, but more so in leisure. The shift in demand is mainly related to the digitalization of information. From our side, our position has always been to show “Morocco through our eyes“ to our clients in a tailor made manner. We are always opening up new authentic and interactive experiences so as to encourage people to understand and live our country, rather than going on a strictly touristic path. We have observed this shift in demand, and we have found it to be good because it emphasizes our real value much better as experts of the destination. When we do our sales calls in the different markets we target, we show this expertise. We explain there is much more to see behind a medina or a mosque. We have to adapt our business model based on changing needs. Often our revenue will come from charging a management fee, for example. Even in the last few years, despite the slowdown the country experienced, there was great growth. Between 2017 and 2019, we have experienced double-digit growth.</p><h4>What services weigh more in terms of revenue?</h4><p>MICE and business travel is 70% of our business, but leisure is growing. We are opening the leisure part, and the frontier between business and leisure is less clear now. You organize a congress, and then some people will ask for extensions to make it into a vacation. People really appreciate our approach because it is different than just selling a typical packaged product. We make people interact with the country, and people are taken to lesser known places that are more authentic.  Innovation is however dual. Sometimes we would create something new for the MICE business and then adapt it to our high end leisure groups and individuals or vice-versa.</p><h4>What is your average client profile?</h4><p>We are a B2B company. We rarely work with individuals directly. Most of our clients come from our business partners (corporations, international tour operators, event and marketing agencies, travel agencies, etc.) and our representative agents. Our local business is more B2B, so we work with corporations to manage their accounts.  </p><h4>Do you consider authenticity as the path to a sustainable tourism sector?</h4><p>Yes, that is the key for a sustainable sector, and that is on trend. When people travel, they want to see something different: it is up to us to make something different. It is obviously more difficult and challenging to create that authentic experience than operating more already set touristic programs. We have a double mission. First, it is our duty to promote this authenticity and look for it across the country. To be more inclusive, sometimes we go in the middle of the desert and contact remote communities that may even live without access to electricity. Second, we need to do it in a way that does not make it like an industry so as not to spoil the experience nor the communities that we are interacting with. That's why we mostly focus on high-end clients who are willing to pay for something more authentic in a way that will bring value to the country and its communities.</p><h4>One of the challenges of the country is to sell this added value. What is your view?</h4><p>Our market is global, and currently destinations are in competition against each other. We must then establish a unique selling proposition that will differentiate us from other destinations. Fortunately we are blessed with so many different sights and cultural wealth. We should focus on these elements. I understand from a broader perspective that the country needs to bring more tourists and people have to manage their budgets accordingly. Therefore not everything can be done on authenticity and uniqueness. However it is important to show that Morocco is diverse. Maybe people would like to go hiking or go to the beach, and visit some cultural sites. In Morocco, tourists must try different things. For example, we have one of the best windsurfing spots in the world. Marrakech is the most touristic city in Morocco and yet still has so many hidden gems to still attract people. Overall to be able to sell our entire offer we need the adequate infrastructure around it.  For this infrastructure to be sustainable you cannot rely only on tourism, there must be a business environment around it too. Local people that will benefit from this development and contribute to it at the same time. In my opinion this is one good way to sell our country as a whole and not only the very well know touristic areas.</p><h4>Can one keep that authenticity without being commercial?</h4><p>First, we are a long way from being commercial, especially comparing to countries like Spain or France, for instance. Maybe there are some specific areas that are touristic; maybe from there, we can shift this interest to areas that are completely unknown.</p><h4>What are you going to focus on for 2020?</h4><p>Historically, we have had mostly a business travel focus, since we are working with a lot of corporations.  Now we are focusing more on bringing tourists to Morocco, so it is going to be a similar strategy for 2020. We are present in the US, Mexico, most of Europe, the Middle East, Russia, and other regions through our partners. Now we are trying to develop a bit more and know more about these markets. Our value proposition is unique we need to market it more with our target clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the evolution of the company since its creation in 2012?</h4><p>Jumia is the leading e-commerce platform in Africa that was created in 2012 to serve consumers and provide access to different goods and services. Jumia is present in 11 countries (Nigeria, Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Cí´te d'Ivoire, Senegal, Ghana, Uganda and South Africa). Jumia is built around a marketplace, Jumia Logistics, and JumiaPay. The marketplace helps millions of consumers and thousands of sellers to connect and transact. Our marketplace includes on-demand services, which are mainly restaurant deliveries and supermarket groceries that we deliver in a short timeframe. Jumia Logistics enables the delivery of millions of packages through our network of local partners. JumiaPay facilitates the payments of online transactions for Jumia's ecosystem and allows consumers to access digital services to top up. their phone cards, pay bills or access streaming services. With over 1 billion people and 500 million internet users in Africa, Jumia believes that e-commerce is making people's lives easier by helping them shop and pay for millions of products at the best prices wherever they live. E-commerce is also creating new opportunities for SMEs to grow, and job opportunities for a new generation to thrive. Today in Africa, we have more than 110,000 vendors who we connect with millions of customers.</p><h4>In terms of numbers, Jumia's Morocco website had more than 9.5 million monthly visits on average in 2019, as well as 5,000 sellers and over 300,000 products. What has been the strategy that has led to becoming the number-one e-commerce company and one of the top-10 most visited sites in Morocco?</h4><p>Jumia's leverage is that it is physically present in every market it serves and is able to provide an understanding of the needs of every customer in every market. The Egyptian customer is not the Moroccan or Nigerian customer. That is why our advantage is being able to tailor our offer to the needs of each population. Customers are usually looking for a wide assortment of goods; the wider we can make that assortment, the more satisfied the customer is. The second aspect is providing goods at the best price. Having many vendors on the platform drives the competition and provides the best offers for customers. Third is that we are able to adapt to market barriers, such as awareness level about e-commerce. To address this, we educate customers on how e-commerce works, safety, convenience , and ease of use and help them trust it. The final thing is dealing with customers' fears of online payments where we developed a cash-on-delivery approach, which allows the customer to pay when he receives the goods, thus putting the customer at ease with the purchasing process. This also allows people who do not have a credit card to be able to access our offer. We were also able to develop a logistics service that is tailored to e-commerce. In Africa, there was a clear need for logistics providers who are ready for e-commerce in the areas we wanted to serve. Being able to deliver across Morocco and in all rural areas of Africa is something we managed to build ourselves in order to develop a service that covers the widest area. And because it is tailored to e-commerce, it is speedy, with a clear process for returning products, something other logistics providers are unable to do.</p><h4>During the COVID-19 outbreak, e-commerce has been one of the few sectors that has experienced growth in the past months. How has COVID-19 affected your daily operations?</h4><p>With the confinement, habits of Moroccan customers have started to change. They have become more interested in essential goods and grocery shopping, as customers are worried about getting access to such goods and worried about supermarkets being exposed to the virus. Therefore, they have started to use the digital platform, with many customers buying disinfectant gels, masks, gloves, detergents, groceries, water, oil, and flour. We have also seen growth for another kind of necessity: products necessary for being “connected.“ We have seen people buying computers, printers, phones, TVs, and appliances that are essential to be connected at home, as people want to be connected to families, relatives, and work. We have also been able to make partnerships with big supermarket chains in order to provide a wider assortment of goods. We also provide support to charities that want to deliver certain goods, with McDonalds delivering meals to different associations, hospitals, and police stations. We have contributed our logistics capabilities to deliver these donations. We also have helped chefs, who are cooking for people in need, in collecting donations on our platform to make it easier for them to buy essential products to cook their meals.</p><h4>What measures are you taking to provide safety to your employees, clients, and products?</h4><p>For us, the most important thing when COVID-19 started was protecting the health of our customers, our teams, and our partners. We have taken a wide range of measures to protect all the people interacting within our ecosystem. The first is about respecting social distancing guidelines. Our office teams are now working from home, where possible. In our warehouses, we have taken measures in order to decrease the amount of people in the same area. We provide all our delivery agents and people in contact with goods and customers with handwashing stations and disinfectant gels. We also regularly disinfect our warehouses and facilities to ensure that our teams are protected. We also measure the temperature of those who are working and who are in contact with clients.</p><h4>What is your main priority for 2020?</h4><p>Today, our main focus is around the current COVID-19 situation and making sure that we can deliver to our consumers the goods they need thanks to two main strategies. The first priority is making our online platform more accessible for customers to encourage the adoption of e-commerce. The second priority will be ensuring we are increasing the quality of our assortment, specifically in the categories that are more interesting to our customers on a daily basis; at the moment, these are supermarkets, beauty, and fashion. The final priority is about making it easier for people to pay online. We are developing more payment methods with JumiaPay, which allows customers to access different payment services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements over 2019?</h4><p>To start, 2019 was difficult for us. A few projects saw delays, and there were some payment issues. There were bankruptcies, which left us with outstanding payments. We made the decision to stop supplying some of these companies to control our payments. Since October 2019, however, we have seen good figures and turnover, and we were able to recover to some extent during this time. 2020 has seen a good start; however, we can see that the coronavirus will have a huge impact on our business. That being said, things will be okay. The government is taking the necessary actions. The upturn at the end of 2019 was a result of the government's investment in megaprojects, in which we are registered. We are not in the retail business, so we mainly target direct sales, which are projects. We thought of diversifying into the retail business because it is sustainable. However, in the end, we did not make that push. I am still a firm believer that there will be more megaprojects coming to Saudi Arabia. Of all the products we supply, water proofing, concrete repair, sealants, adhesives and flooring are the common products CMCI is supplying.</p><h4>How will Saudi Vision 2030 change the construction and hospitality sectors?</h4><p>It will certainly boost the building materials business. It will also push for some innovative products. We, for example, are targeting a new technology for water treatment and storage of drinking water. We are doing this as an investment with international companies that are leaders in this technology. We are joining them as distributors in Saudi Arabia for one of these technologies we will start manufacturing. Diversity is the key when it comes to innovative products. This company has its own R&amp;D department now titled the Innovative Department. We invest a lot in this area. We will be the first company to introduce green technology to Saudi Arabia. We want to implement processes within the organization that reduce waste and complexity in formulae. We want to reduce the chance of making errors in production. We also want to reduce waste in the packaging of the raw materials we buy, which means buying in bulk. We see automation as a step toward this goal. We have many facilities in Saudi Arabia that provide bulk storage as well. This will be compliant with Industry 4.0.</p><h4>How would you evaluate new technologies with regard to knowledge transfer and the human talent in Saudization? What is your opinion of the education sector's efforts to support innovation?</h4><p>For the past few years, we have been pushing for Saudization, as we invest a lot in Saudization. We recruit talented Saudis that have studied in the Kingdom or abroad. We are more than satisfied with the performance from those we have recruited. Our HR department has Saudization as its main focus, and this is a policy within the whole group. Khalifa Algosaibi Group is really pushing for this. This future is for Saudi Arabia, which is why we are finding Saudis to fill many positions in the head office and the whole country.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your partnerships with Aramco and Saudi Electricity Company, and how do you continue to pursue collaborations and expand your clientele?</h4><p>First, having innovative products opens many doors. It also attracts major players like Aramco. We also need to have product localization, as it is a driver to develop business in Saudi Arabia. We try to develop the majority of our products locally. We try to use a majority of local raw materials. In fact, this is all linked: we try to have a high score to be able to push our locally manufactured products. We have a team in technical service with consultants to meet with large groups to promote products and do local testing. This is how we develop the business. We have 10-12% of the market share with our innovative products. The aim is to start producing those products locally so that we are no longer importing, which is what everyone else does. This is how we will differentiate ourselves. The beauty of doing business as CMCI and being a part of Khalifa Algosaibi Group is that we act quickly without needing excessive approvals. The board is efficient, which makes the process effective.</p><h4>What has been your success with exportation?</h4><p>We are still pushing exports to Africa. We are currently at the level of 12-15% for export volume. Our vision is to target Africa. We have conducted many market surveys in Morocco, Algeria, Senegal, Rwanda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. We have not yet made a decision, because we are still looking for the right partner for distribution. We do also target Australia and the Maldives. We are thinking bigger, so Australia is the largest place we are currently targeting to develop some of our innovative products. We will start with a small set up that would grow slowly and organically. We are open to acquisitions as well, depending on the opportunities that arise.</p><h4>What are your goals and strategic priorities for the coming months and years?</h4><p>The strategy of the company is to grow, be that locally or geographically. We will expand elsewhere either through acquisition or investing ourselves. Our biggest market share is in Saudi, so we are putting into place a strategic plan for growth. We know our strengths in area and products, as well as places that require investment. I project a growth of 5-7% percent for 2021. We are targeting 5% for CMCI in 2020. In spite of the current situation with the virus, we are still optimistic about reaching these figures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Accenture different from its competitors in helping achieve Vision 2030?</h4><p>Accenture in Saudi Arabia wants to make sure it is the partner of choice as the government goes through Vision 2030 and that whatever it offers in the market is building on that. We focus on four major areas. One is privatization and commercialization. The privatization journey is a long but important one, because the entity going through privatization wants it done in a structured manner with good governance and maximized interest. The commercialization part is where the assets remain, though you want to enhance the return on that particular investment. Our role is to ensure the experience for privatization and commercialization is maximized. The second area is optimization, which is ensuring our clients continue to provide best-quality services to their clients, whether they are banks, retail organizations, or in travel and tourism. The third area we focus on is digital transformation, which is core to the vision and what many industries we work with in Saudi Arabia consider a priority. The last element is the people. We want to be the partner of choice with our clients for their people as we go through this transformation. All these elements are core to the vision and transformation taking place in the country.</p><h4>What specific services have you developed for the Saudi market, and what is your opinion of the country's digital transformation?</h4><p>Technology and digital transformation are critical especially if we look at payment platforms. Customers can use their credit cards, though it has evolved from scanning a card to using point-of- sale systems, tapping, and now to phones. Financial services in Saudi Arabia is the largest business for Accenture, so part of that is making sure that we provide our clients with our experience on how to enhance that journey. The second element Accenture brings to the table is around ventures and entrepreneurship, which is encouraging both local entrepreneurs and ventures from around the world to provide even further value to our clients. At any point in time, we look at between 10,000 and 15,000 start-ups around the world, and we encourage local engagements to explore that.</p><h4>How will the current economic transformation shape the role of Saudi Arabia in the region?</h4><p>Economic development in Saudi Arabia is moving toward diversification of different types of industry. There is still a big dependency on oil, oil products, and chemicals, though I see other industries like tourism and entertainment developing as well. In financial services, too, we can see some clear leaders, like Saudi Payments developed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) and where billions of dollars are transacted every day. SAMA also built a platform called ESAL, a B2B e-payment platform that enables enhanced financial transaction management and reduces the need for cash payments as well as parallel transactions that are not linked to commercial transactions. By linking payments with transactions, you reduce the amount of paperwork and physical cash movement with increased transparency. It can also enhance other financial transactions such as taxes and VAT so that you do not have to print a receipt and submit to the tax authorities as it is all linked to the other entities.</p><h4>What is your vision for matching a transformed Saudi economy with a skilled Saudi workforce?</h4><p>We want to make sure the talent in the market providing various services is locally based. We look at the talents of the future, as there is talent that is basic and continues to be in demand but is more commoditized. There are many entities to help develop that type of talent for basic programming, technology or operation. AI, for example, is a certain direction where we need to ensure there is talent in the Saudi market that can provide the services required. There are other areas like security that will continue to be a focus area, and talent development for security will continue to be in demand. This can be security on infrastructure, data, applications, interfacing, and so on.</p><h4>What sort of a Saudi economy do you see in five years, and where do you see opportunities?</h4><p>I see economic development being around tourism, hospitality, and entertainment. Logistics and supply chain will also be a significant element of the economic mixture. Financial services are another big area that can be a significant part of how the economy will be developed. Within that, there are many different elements. Hospitality and tourism opportunities could be around physical locations like Neom or the Red Sea as well as around family entertainment or experience entertainment. We also need to remain focused on how technology and AI will impact this. The impact of the proper adoption and deployment of AI in Saudi Arabia by 2030 will be more than USD200 billion in terms of additional economic impact.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the landmark achievements in the last 12 months for Virgin Megastore?</h4><p>We have done a great deal at Virgin Megastore over the last 12 months. We accomplished our short-term expansion plan by: Opening six new branches: Salaam Mall, Mall of Arabia, Panorama Mall, Riyadh Park Mall, Riyadh Airport, and Makkah Train Station. Launching our e-commerce business and will finalize the Arabic version in mid-2020. We are just implementing SAP all-in-one in addition to the BI - Business Intelligence. Launching our loyalty program, reaching 70% Saudization and 25% female personnel, though we are looking for much more. Our aim is to reach 40% female workers at Virgin Megastore. We are turned into one of the leaders of the ticketing sales in the entertainment industry.</p><h4>What recent economic and retail trends have you noticed in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>The landscape of the retail is changing. Consumers are price conscious and are looking for experience, quality, and value for money.  Experience that speak to them, that show retailers understand what they want and need and feel. Customers are shifting from brand loyalty to personalization.  Unlike the older generation, who were loyal to the brand itself. Individualization is one of the biggest shifts taking place in today's retail market. any product in Virgin Megastore can be customized. Customers are mature focusing on responsible consumption. Our buying team apply some criteria to procure only the products that add value for the consumer.</p><h4>How do you address the economic realities of COVID-19 at the operational level?</h4><p>This is the most significant crisis that the world has seen in perhaps the last 100 years. Business has been deeply affected. We are in a massive battle to survive. We are not thinking about profitability; it is just about surviving and cashflow. Virgin Megastore had to close all its branches.  Our brave sales team are now our delivery team. They are doing the last mile of our e-commerce activities and deliver in two hours max. We are applying lots of preventative measures and controls for the safety of our team and the consumer. At the operational level, most of the company is working on real-time data to identify which products are most in demand now. For example, there is no need for tennis shoes at the moment, though home sports equipment, e-learning products, musical instruments, and board games are in high demand. We are monitoring the data and sales. The long-term social and economic impact of COVID-19 is still unknown, though it will change the economy. Even Vision 2030 will be affected. The crisis will slow down the economy in general, and while new opportunities will happen, they will be few for several industries.</p><h4>Virgin Megastores has a Made in Saudi section. How do you continue to pursue collaborations to extend these local brands portfolio?</h4><p>Young Saudis are extremely passionate about local art and crafts and have developed their own spin that fuses formal art while upholding local culture and tastes. Due to the unique combination of Saudi's local arts and crafts, we have taken a similar focus at Virgin Megastore. Also, one of the main drivers behind Vision 2030 is highlighting local content. Therefore, Virgin Megastores in Saudi has created a section called Mahali, in Arabic means both “local“ and “my store.“ We are addressing all the designers and talent in Saudi Arabia; Virgin Megastore is their own shop. The purpose of our Mahali section is to support these local heroes. One of the ways we support, taking less than the usual commercial margin on their products. Educate them about operating commercially, doing packaging, and how to do business and manage their finances properly. <br>We give them exposure on the right platform.  We biography about the producers/designers of each item.<br>These local heroes include Saudi brands in fashion, jewelry, and household items. Anything that local artists, designers, and talent can produce. We launched Mahali as a demonstration in our Red Sea Mall store in Jeddah and the concept is still in the testing phase.</p><h4>Saudi Arabia has recently opened up for concerts and events with big international artists. What is Virgin Megastore doing to capture more opportunities and trends in the entertainment and retail sectors?</h4><p>Over the last two years, Virgin Megastore has led the events ticketing business in Saudi. In addition to ticketing sales, we have been providing some services related to events. We take care of the entrance the meet and greet and merchandizing. Before Vision 2030, one could not get neither signing sessions nor merchandise related to artists such as figurines, posters, T-shirts.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and short- and long-term goals at Virgin Megastore given these extraordinary times?</h4><p>Many things will change in the long term. The short term, things will stay as they are, especially in terms of technology. Virgin Megastore is a customer-centric brand, and our short-term goal is to focus on customer service through our loyalty program and e-commerce platform which is omnichannel. We seek to provide the fastest delivery time within the Kingdom. Virgin Megastore delivers in two hours. We are upgrading our website to add AI and, at the same time, add a human touch. When a customer shops online, they can connect with one of our expert sales team consultants through a video call and have an item explained and be shown different colors and options. We will offer a combination of technology such as AI together with the human touch. Our loyalty program is called Limitless, we are trying to do a limitless offer for our customers. We will also open the largest Virgin Megastore in the world in Riyadh; it is a beautiful shop. This will include a coffee shop, music academy, and a music and video studio that customers can use to do their own recordings. This is a whole new concept for Virgin Megastore, and it will be the biggest of our stores in the world. The most important part of our strategy is we are localizing our brand and speaking the local language through our brand. With 70% of our team being Saudi, we are part of this society. The beauty of Virgin brand is that it is an international brand with a local flavor.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of COVID-19 on the Mozambican economy and your operations?</h4><p>This global pandemic is a new and unforeseen development that will affect the world's health systems as well as the global economy. All we can do is to prepare ourselves against this threat and try to limit the damage. At Nacala Logistics, our first priority is to ensure the safety of our local and international staff. We have taken a series of measures that include all the different segments of the Nacala Corridor, from Moatize, Tete, and Malawi to Nacala. In terms of hygiene, we ensure our employees have access to all the necessary products, such as hand sanitizers and masks. We are applying a daily systematic control of potential symptoms developed by our workers, even those who are working from home. We want to provide comfort and security to our workers in a way that does not hinder operations. In terms of the impact on the economy, we are still at an early phase of the pandemic to make a definitive assessment. At the moment, the demand for exports and imports has dwindled. This is a problem for Mozambique and its neighbors, which are highly interconnected and dependent on the movements of imports and exports for domestic consumption. While Mozambique's economy will be put under strong pressure, and things will be hard in the coming months, I do not see this affecting production and trade in the medium to long term. There will be a recovery; every post-crisis period represents a momentum for rapid and strong growth.</p><h4>What have been the main highlights for Nacala Logistics?</h4><p>Since its inception, Nacala Logistics' primary goal was the efficient transportation of goods to and from the Mozambican port of Nacala. Guided by this mission, we have built one of the best railways and port infrastructures in Africa, with a highly modern signaling system, a railway infrastructure with large capacity, and modern wagons. To improve efficiency, in early 2020, we started pushing through a rebranding plan, regrouping all entities of the Corridor of Nacala—the Northern Development Corridor (CDN), the Nacala Logistics Corridor (CLN), and the Central East African Railways of Malawi (CEAR)—into a single commercial entity, Nacala Logistics. The main goal is to strengthen and dynamize these companies, improve management and operations efficiency, and provide security to our clients such as Vale as well as those who import and export consumer goods through the corridor. Since 2016, we have transported almost 30 million tons of coal and almost 2 million tons of consumer goods for countries in southern Africa. These numbers are constantly growing. Our expectation for 2020 is to transport 500,000 tons of consumer goods and to double this amount in 2021. For coal, we want to transport 10 million tons in 2020 and 15 million tons next year.</p><h4>How would you define your commitment to developing Mozambique's economy?</h4><p>The project was born out of the necessity to ensure the efficient transportation of coal from the Moatize mines in Tete province to the port of Nacala, passing through Malawi. Thus, our main client has always been Vale, the biggest producer of coal in Mozambique. However, every mine has a limited lifespan; after reaching its peak, its volume of production slowly dwindles, while the port and the railway infrastructure continue. For this reason, we have oriented our investment to serve wider economic activity from the start, in parallel to the coal industry. Given the enormous potential of agriculture in Mozambique, we have committed to develop this sector as the biggest long-term value chain. Indeed, one of the main benefits of the project is that it brings development and employment to the nearby communities, driving small economies. There will not be development if it is not inclusive; for this reason, more than 90% of our workers are locals, and we want to increase this number to almost 100% by the next five years. We have a number of projects to support the 15,000 families that live along the corridor. We are supporting the creation of an industrial park in Nacala and Blantyre, we have a program to promote agriculture in Nampula and its surrounding regions, and we have an important program with our engineering department to support local SMEs, with the aim of transforming local companies and agri-businesses into suppliers for the corridor. Developing the local value chain is also key to ensure the efficient, timely, and cost-effective delivery of services in the long run and avoid dependence on foreign services and products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the outcome of your recent visit to Mozambique?</h4><p>My official visit to Mozambique at the beginning of 2020 had a very positive outcome and was a success. It was an honor to be present at President Filipe Nyusi's oath of office for his second mandate, as it was an honor to have him in Lisbon when I took mine in 2016. Given the common history between Portugal and Mozambique and the existing friendship between our two countries, there is always room to opening further possibilities of cooperation and investment, and this trip was no exception.</p><h4></h4><p><em>Marcelo Nuno Duarte Rebelo de Sousa with President Nyusi.</em></p><h4><em></em><br><em></em></h4><h4>What are the key areas in the bilateral relations between Portugal and Mozambique?</h4><p>Our common historic ties have granted both our countries with the opportunity to develop a multitude of areas of close partnership. Besides our shared language, which in itself constitutes a whole universe of possibilities to explore, I would definitely underline the importance of the Portuguese community in Mozambique and of the Mozambican one living in Portugal. Of course, we then have all the traditional areas of a friendly and flourishing bilateral relationship, namely a robust political and institutional cooperation, in particular between our two governments, a dynamic cultural collaboration, and a strong economic and commercial partnership to which the private sector has been key player. We have also been working hard in order to advance and expand on the education and academia fields, as children and youngsters will constitute the base of our common future. Furthermore, I would have to highlight the importance of all the projects and initiatives Portugal has supported, in close cooperation with Mozambican authorities and other partners, for the development of Mozambique and furthering of its economy and growth. It has been a central element of the Portuguese foreign policy to fund and support initiatives in the most diverse areas in and with historical partner countries such as Mozambique. No less important, I consider elementary to accentuate Portugal's long lasting and unbreakable commitment to support, in any ways deemed useful by our Mozambican counterparts, the complete stabilization of the peace process in the whole country. Finally, I would also mention our bilateral cooperation within the international arena, more broadly at the UN, where we, Portuguese-speaking countries, have created a curious web of mutual understanding and support, and on a more specific note, at the CPLP, a community that embodies not only a shared language, but also an increasingly common way to relate and cooperate.</p><h4></h4><p><em>Marcelo Nuno Duarte Rebelo de Sousa on his recent trip to Mozambique.</em></p><h4><br></h4><h4>In what ways has Portugal committed assistance to Mozambique in the aftermath of 2019's catastrophic cyclones Idai and Kenneth?</h4><p>Idai and Kenneth cyclones were major catastrophes for Mozambique, and Portugal has been deeply committed to the recovery plans of Mozambique's most affected areas since the first moment. In this sense, our financial support to the recovery and reconstruction efforts underway has been considerable (a total amount of EUR70 million until July 2019) and directed mainly to Portuguese and Mozambican companies operating on the most affected provinces; hence, helping them not only to reconstruct economically in the short term, but also to create jobs and improve the living conditions of Mozambicans which will, in the long term, be most beneficial.</p><p><br><em></em></p><h4>Europe has had to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic a few weeks before Africa, and many fear Mozambique has still to see the worst effects. What lessons can Portugal teach Mozambique in terms of managing the pandemic?</h4><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is certainly the most demanding challenge we have globally faced in this 21st century. This is a threat that knows no borders, economic or social inequalities, religions, or cultural differences. This is a threat that calls for a common response and for the solidarity between all international players. Numbers show that Portugal has apparently already reached a plateau. This doesn't mean the menace has been tackled or that the crisis has been overcome. There is still a long way to go, and now, more than ever, we need to be resilient and thorough, to trust the opinions and guidelines of the scientific community, which also integrate the recommendations of the World Health Organization.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the origins of the school and how has it evolved through the years?</h4><p>Initially, in 1995, the school's initial mission was to provide instruction to private bankers in Switzerland, but after changing its name officially to Geneva Business School in 2010 an expansion began. Although I am primarily responsible for the development in Spain, schools have been opened in locations which are further afield, such as Kazakhstan, Myanmar, in addition to a partnership which has been forged with the countries in the Middle East such as UAE and Saudi Arabia. Our main goal is to prepare each student for an unpredictable future, therefore we ensure that our attention is concentrated upon giving each student a very practical based education. Although we are not able to foresee what jobs will look like in the next five years, we are capable of providing students the necessary skills to take into the business sector in the future and furthermore, as a private institution, we have the opportunity to adapt more efficiently to the market needs.  </p><h4>So, do the skills you teach your students include adaptability and flexibility? </h4><p>Yes definitely. According to the World Economic Forum by 2022, there will be 73 million job losses, yet 130 million jobs will be created. Although we are unaware of exactly what type of jobs they are referring to, Geneva Business School is able to help students grow professionally by giving them the necessary skills and tools which they will be able to take from the classroom into the working world. One skills I am talking about, for example, is critical thinking, a skill which is of great importance now and will be more sought after in the future. We do not have exams, instead we have adapted to a more project-based learning environment. Project based learning is more beneficial as it's more connected to the real working world and essentially closer to tasks students will carry out on a daily basis in their professional careers. To enhance the project-based learning, the students will have the opportunity to network and listen to business professionals who share their career experiences, successes and challenges from within the classroom, at specially organized events and field trips. At Geneva Business School we have stepped away from traditional university methodologies by being fully flexible in our approach. We are able to adapt when necessary, by being open to collaborate with our students, to listen to what they have to say, to support them in any way we possibly can and to be open to new opinions and interpretations. We have a classroom called Incubator, purposefully named as it is a space in which we harness and invest in the ideas presented by our students.  </p><h4>What does innovation mean for GBS?</h4><p>In the past there has been a very traditional and specific style of teaching that has been ingrained within the education sector, yet I believe it is essential for an educational program to consistently develop and evolve. More recently it has become apparent that there is a gap between the fundamental information that a student should learn, and what the market actually requires of its employees. This being said, we have to ask ourselves how can we, as a business school, ensure that this gap is closed? The answer is to bring the real world into the classroom! This means breaking hierarchical boundaries between students and the professors, by creating more student to teacher, and student to student interaction, and moreover to allow interesting dialogues between students and professors in the classroom environment. At GBS we use the flipped-classroom method, meaning that we digitize all our teaching content so that students can prepare their work before coming to class. This is beneficial as during class hours they are able to focus primarily on collaborating with fellow colleagues on real projects. <br>I am part of the Google Innovator program, currently working as a mentor for last  year's academy in Spain. To become a Google Innovator I put forward a proposal to develop an app that would give professors real-time information about the performance of their students with the aim of changing the classroom dynamic. Geneva Business School is also part of the Google Education community and thus Google is the main platform which students use to check their daily tasks. Not only does the implementation of Google mean that we are a paperless campus, but more importantly, students become very familiar with the use of all Google apps which consequently will aid them significantly when embarking on a new career path.</p><h4>Why did GBS choose Barcelona, in the first place, and Spain more generally?</h4><p>We started the Barcelona project in 2014. The reason to open the Barcelona campus, aside from the fact that it is a beautiful city with lovely weather and amazing people, is that it has a very entrepreneurial spirit and is therefore completely aligned to our beliefs as a business school. We started with a small group which almost immediately doubled in size and we are still growing today. In 2018 we realized that we were going to reach our maximum capacity. As Spain was such a success, we decided to open a new campus in Madrid which too has a great deal of attributes that go together with our vision. The projection for this new semester is that the school is going to triple in the number of students intakes this coming year, and we are confident that Madrid will follow the same path. Although we are ambitious we do not wish to have a school with thousands of students, we want to be a boutique business school that has a maximum intake of 300 students. Our classrooms have a capacity of 25 students, which enables us to give a more personalized support to each student. This support is continued outside of the classroom, with coaches who are on hand to provide further assistance to students from the moment they start their journey with Geneva Business School from choosing the right major, to the end of their journey when searching for internships and study abroad programs.</p><h4>How do the degrees that you offer in oil and gas or sports management, for example, differ from a traditional business management degree?</h4><p>The Bachelor program is in Business Administration and along side these fundamental core modules needed for a business degree, students also take a major. This means that twenty percent of their course is related to that specific major. The Sports Management major that we offer has equipped students to enter the sports industry and we have numerous success stories, including students obtaining employment at well known football clubs. It is important for us to immerse students as much as possible in the practical elements of their major. We are fortunate enough to have professors working in sports organizations, such as UEFA, and so students are given the opportunity to visit such organizations to gain a clearer understanding of the daily functionality of the business from ticketing to press conferences.</p><h4>What are your objectives for 2019 for the school?</h4><p>We are expanding the school on a global level, so besides from the campuses we have in Madrid and Barcelona, we have initiated a program in India for example. Our objective is also to consolidate the programs we have here in Barcelona in our Madrid campus. I believe that 2019 will definitely be a consolidation year for us, particularly for the Madrid campus. The campus in Barcelona has reached its maximum capacity and as a result we are looking to open new campuses in both Barcelona and Madrid.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us a background to Hutchison Ports and how it has evolved here in Barcelona? </h4><p>Hutchison Ports is a subsidiary of a multinational conglomerate called CK Hutchison, which consists of five core businesses in ports and related services, retail, infrastructure, energy and telecommunications. Hutchison Ports operates 52 ports in 27 countries. Hutchison Ports BEST in Barcelona is different as it is the first semi-automatic terminal within the group and the most efficient terminal with an average of approximately 40 moves per hour, allowing our customers to recover lost time and save fuel compared to other conventional ports. Hutchison Ports acquired the terminal in 2006, from the Grupo Mestre, a family-owned Spanish company. We won the bidding process from the Port Authority of Barcelona to build and operate a new terminal through a concession agreement. We began our semi-automatic operations in 2012; hundreds of millions of euros were invested into the terminal facilities and into a customised terminal operating system, nGen, developed by our headquarters in Hong Kong and adapted to BEST's specifications with the collaboration of our local team.</p><h4>What tools and processes are in place to increase efficiency?</h4><p>Apart from having the latest technology and a smart software in place, we ensure that our operations remain simple and efficient. We designed a semi-automatic terminal to ensure we had the best of both worlds, combining technology on one side and people efficiency on the other.</p><h4>How are you growing to tackle the growing demand of e-commerce?</h4><p>Every week, we receive vessels with a capacity of 19,000 TEUs, thus we are growing and improving our facilities. We have increased the height of our quay cranes by 5 metres to service the largest vessels coming in and we are also increasing our container yard capacity — adding three more blocks this year to our terminal yard thus increasing our handling capacity. The increasing ecommerce demand must be analysed by all supply chain players so as to rapidly adapt their processes especially custom procedures and regulations.</p><h4>Do you think there will be more competition in the sector as the Mediterranean Corridor gains more momentum and more infrastructure is built?</h4><p>The Mediterranean Corridor is a logical solution for the imbalance suffered in Europe, as most vessels are going to northern European ports. There are cases where the containers are returning back to Spain, leading to environmental impact, higher cost freights and increases transit times. The infrastructure is currently in place and we can cross the border to France, but we need to improve the efficiency in several aspects such as customs and better integration and coordination between countries. This will happen sooner or later, because it makes market sense.</p><h4>What is your sustainability plan and how are you working to lower your emissions?</h4><p>BEST is one of the greenest terminal in Spain as most of the equipment is powered by electricity. Furthermore, we believe in the future of rail transport, Synergy, our own in-house rail operator has been created to lower emission within the supply chain. We have also invested in inland terminals in Pamplona and Zaragoza linking Barcelona to these inland rail terminals. Developing rail transportation is the one of the best ways to meet environmental concerns from a logistics point of view. In addition, the Port Authority is strict regarding environmental issues, and this year we are exploring a project with them called 'Shore Power' on how to supply electricity to berths whereby their intention is to provide all quays close to the City with on-shore power so that ships can plug-in and avoid any emission release; the President of the Barcelona Port Authority has stated that “we will reduce NOx emission by 35 % in 2023.“</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the greatest challenge you face in Barcelona in the sector?</h4><p>BEST is one of the most efficient terminals in the world, but efficiency alone is not enough. We need to create new services with added value to our customers and introduce new solutions, both inside and outside the terminal, which will allow us to bring more cargo to Barcelona. Another challenge is to enter the French market through the Mediterranean Corridor and thus expand the hinterland of the Port of Barcelona. We want to be a smarter terminal adapting to new technology, not only through data utilization but also through analytical prediction. However, technology is becoming more and more a commodity, what really makes us different is our people, and you need talented and motivated people to innovate on a daily basis, at the end of the day, innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of ECT and where it is situated in Abu Dhabi's higher education landscape?<br></strong>ECT is a private university accredited by the Ministry of Higher Education and has been in operation for almost 25 years. We started with a small institution and quickly developed into a leading institution. It now has 1,800 students and offers 20 academic degrees, 16 bachelor's degrees, and four diplomas. At present, ECT has four faculties: medical and health sciences, media, business, and engineering. Our student population is two-thirds Emirati, divided almost equally between males and females. The opening of our new state-of-the-art campus in the heart of Abu Dhabi will allow us to accommodate more programs and significantly increase our overall capacity. It will enable us to apply the latest technology while also addressing the future demands of the labor market.</p><p><strong>What factors are shaping the expansion of ECT and how do changes in the labor market affect curriculum design?<br></strong>There is a growing awareness that the job market is undergoing significant change, especially within the context of the fourth industrial revolution. This has prompted us to offer our newly accredited engineering and health sciences programs that reflect these changes. Several feasibility studies have also guided us to diversify and develop programs that will accommodate the future needs of students. The higher education sector cannot respond as quickly to these changes as other sectors. There are rigorous quality control and accreditation measures in place. Currently, the UAE has more than 80 academic institutions that are accredited by the higher education commission for academic accreditation (CAA), offering more than 1,000 academic programs. There has been a global shift in accreditation and quality control, from controlling the input of the programs to become results based. We need to focus on skills that the students will need in the future. The most important part is the outcome, and there is a component of added feedback from the industry. Beng results-based makes curriculum design more flexible and can accommodate some innovations and some ideas rather than being input-based. Responding to changes is embedded in our motto: We prepare for future careers.</p><p><strong>In what ways do you engage with the private sector and industry leaders to ensure the curriculum applies to the job market?<br></strong>To ensure compliance with quality control and accreditation processes, we have an industry advisor's council for each of our four faculties. It is the task of advisors to formulate strategy and best practices to ensure our programs are appropriate for the sectors they represent. Furthermore, we have a strong alumni network with many of our graduates serving in key positions across the economic spectrum. This interaction further allows us to leverage industry expertise in areas of curriculum design.<br><br><strong>How do you assess the level of engagement between UAE-based higher education institutions and their international counterparts?<br></strong>In addition to our faculty, we also draw on the expertise of academic consultants from international universities. This is particularly important in program development. For example, our newly accredited engineering programs have been designed to be compatible with international accreditation standards, and accordingly, ECT will be ready to apply upon graduation of the first batch of students to the ABET accreditation of its engineering programs. The accreditation process is overseen by the CAA Ministry of Education. Every single program undergoes a thorough review by a specialized external review team supervised by CAA. This is comprised of internationally renowned participants from abroad, usually industry and education leaders. They assess the program before it goes into initial accreditation, then repeated for final accreditation. In addition, the Centre for Continued Education (CEC) forms an integral part of the college. This entity serves the provision for short courses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[island-dreams]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>How is Zaya Nurai Island positioned in Abu Dhabi's hospitality sector?<br></strong>Zaya Nurai Island is a unique concept in Abu Dhabi's hospitality landscape, providing a secluded island environment that is still closely linked to the mainland. It is only possible to reach Nurai by speedboat, helicopter, or seaplane, but the city is just minutes away. While our guests do enjoy the sense of privacy, we still make an effort to connect them to greater Abu Dhabi and the various attractions the city has to offer. The uniqueness of the experience lies in providing this sense of seclusion and connectivity at the same time.</p><h4>What changes have you noticed in the demographics of Abu Dhabi's visitors recently?</h4><p><strong></strong>The opening of the Louvre, followed by the Warner Brothers theme park, saw the arrival of more families among Abu Dhabi's tourists. To cater more to this demographic, in 2019 Zaya Nurai Island built its new water park, which welcomes parents as well as children. Abu Dhabi is also seeing an increase in the length of vacations. In the past, tourists would come to resorts at most for four or five nights. Today, many stay for 10 nights or more to take advantage of the variety of options both in the resort and in the city. We are increasingly looking at developing our presence in the growing market of Chinese tourists throughout 2020, utilizing Chinese public relations agencies to help us. Australian tourists and those from various francophone countries in Europe are also growth markets for us. The major players, however, are the same as they have been for a long time: Germany, the UK, and Russia. The US has significant potential, and we are currently exploring the opportunities there.</p><p><strong>How do high-end resorts utilize technology to aid in building the guest experience?<br></strong>Our travel agency partners normally help us build profiles of our guests to respond to their needs. Our top clients usually come with an agency they have used for many years, one that is familiar with their travel and personal habits. At the highest ends of the luxury travel sector, it is difficult for technology to replace agents, personal assistants, and entourages. We are exploring some applications that allow guests or their staff to securely fill out their profile and upload their passport photo and credit card information before arrival. In the past, we have tried using various complex technology solutions to track guest preferences. In the end, we found that the best way was a simple WhatsApp group for our butlers, where they can share information with one another on clients' needs and whereabouts. We also have a partnership with a professional butler training school in the UK, which comes to train our staff on site. In the end, the goal is to cater to the guest's every need without them having any knowledge of the amount of work happening behind the scenes to do it.</p><p><strong>What are the best ways for the public sector further support Abu Dhabi's hospitality sector going forward?<br></strong>Transportation links can always be improved across the entire UAE. The continued opening of new routes on Etihad Airlines is helpful. The new Al Maktoum Airport is expected to see heavy traffic and is close to Abu Dhabi, but we should continue exploring ways to really take advantage of the opportunity and bring guests more quickly and conveniently into the city. The government of Abu Dhabi, particularly the Department of Culture and Tourism, has been much more active in recent months. The department participates in many shows all over the world. It devotes great attention to helping hoteliers, for example, by bringing us to shows with them at a cost that is maybe 60 or 70% less than if we attended on our own. It keeps us informed about every single policy step and has a dynamic staff that keeps communication channels open at all times.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Agility's current spectrum of services aim to meet Abu Dhabi's logistics sector's needs?<br></strong>Agility is a provider of global end-to-end supply chain solutions. We cover almost the full spectrum of logistics services in transport across all modes, including air, sea, land, and intermodal by rail in addition to customs clearance services. We provide different types of storage, including air conditioned and chilled. We also move and store overweight and oversized cargo. In addition to this, we offer offshore marine services for the oil and gas sector. In 2019, we invested in a new 21,000-sqm warehouse facility and a new fleet of trucks. Unlike Agility, many providers are solely overland transport providers, freight forwarders, warehousing, or marine services providers.</p><p><strong>What have been some of your recent milestones?<br></strong>We have been investing consistently in Abu Dhabi, the GCC, and Africa. Agility's investment strategy has always been focused on emerging markets. There is little or no capital expenditure in Europe or the US, for example. We have been committed to Abu Dhabi regardless of economic cycles. Even though there was a downturn in recent times, we took the opportunity to invest. If you are committed to a market, you can reap the benefits during the downside, as opposed to short-term players who reduce their presence and focus elsewhere during a decline. We invested in a 21,000-sqm warehouse. It is operating at almost full capacity already. Another strategic investment we made recently was to take a plot of land in the Khalifa Industrial Zone (KIZAD). This is for goods that re- quire some work, assembly, or storage. In addition to this, we have invested in our trucks. We now have double trailer operations. We installed heads that can pull two trailers, and adapted the trailers for double-trailer movement. This increases efficiency, lowers costs, and reduces the environmental impact. We also have an initiative that measures our carbon footprint.</p><p><strong>What are some solutions that logistics providers are using to optimize costs and promote efficiency?<br></strong>The double trailer movement is a prime example of how we are promoting efficiency. We are also adjusting our warehousing to optimize space. For most facilities in Abu Dhabi, the maximum height is generally between seven to 10 meters. Our ceilings are higher, allowing for great- er storage capacity in less area. The warehouse is designed in a way where we use every centimeter efficiently. Overall, this allows us to pass on cost savings to our customers.<br></p><p><strong>What are some innovative ways in which you are helping SMEs with their logistics needs? <br></strong>Recently, we invested in shipa.com, a digital online platform that moves air and sea freight. Its is a user-friendly platform that targets SMEs. The majority of SMEs do not have an in-house logistics department, or even enough proper logistics know how.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of the college and where the institution is situated within Abu Dhabi's education ecosystem?<br></strong>The college was established in 2007 to advance teacher training in Abu Dhabi. We wanted to graduate more teachers to fill a necessary gap in the system. We anticipate that our programs will be able to have an immediate positive impact on the system. For example, our post-graduate degree programs on guidance and counseling will prepare school counselors with the skills and tools to help direct students into the right career pathways that meet the job market needs. Counselors play a fundamental role in determining a student's pathway and help alleviate misconceptions that a scientific track is more difficult.<br><br><strong>What are some of the most interesting technologies that you are exploring and deploying in the college?<br></strong>Technology and education are closely linked. The most important thing is not the technology but how it is utilized to support learning in and outside the classroom. Our aim is to give teachers the right tools to support learning. We have been advocating changes and want to move in a more digitalized direction in regards to content delivery. This means integrating AI, VR, and AR into the learning experience. These tools now have support services that can equip teachers with an understanding of how to best deploy these technologies in the classroom. A portion of our new teacher training subject will be converted into different digitalization modes to support teachers. Additionally, we also want teachers and institutions to feel like they have the freedom to experiment with solutions. This advocates a more creative approach to learning.<br><br><strong>What work do you do internationally to build best practices and develop knowledge exchange?<br></strong>ECAE is involved in numerous discussions with national and international partnerships, some of which have materialized in a formal relationship and some are on the way. Notably, we have joint collaborative discussions with University College London, Vanderbilt University, National Institute of Education of Nanyang Technological University, and more local universities such as Khalifa University. Through these strategic partnerships, we are to develop together leadership and teacher training programs, content digitalization, and re- search collaborations that are focused on practice that is research informed.</p><p><strong>How can we foster greater entrepreneurship in learning?<br></strong>There is a great deal of potential for schools to support entrepreneurship; however, right now the support mechanism is not present. A great deal starts with leadership, which is why we are focused on developing our principals through intensive training. ECAE wants to help school leaders understand how to partner with their local communities. Teachers who are engaged are also crucial in this effort. However, the system has to be in place to support these people. One of our ideas is to establish an innovation center that will support creative ideas in the education field. This process will allow us to test the viability of ideas. Interestingly, we have already started discussions with some funds regarding this center. We view ourselves as an essential partner and contributor to the education field. I want us to become the leading educational transformation institute in the UAE and beyond.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What defines ENS' approach to education?<br></strong>ENS is owned by the Ministry of Presidential Affairs, which is one of the branches of the government underneath the president. Our primary mission is to provide future leaders with the education, the skills, and the opportunities to lead not only in the country, but around the world. We are a national school with a global approach, using both the American curriculum and the International Baccalaureate frameworks to deliver our programs. Across our five campuses, we have five primary school programs, three middle years programs, and three diploma years programs. All of our students can earn an American diploma, while some can earn an International Baccalaureate diploma. Our students also receive instruction in the UAE national curriculum. Arabic, Islamic studies, and UAE social studies are required at ENS, blending international education with Emirati culture. Overall, this model is unique in the local education landscape.</p><p><strong>What measurable results have you seen from ENS' education model?<br></strong>ENS tracks its students' graduation from college and entry into their chosen post-secondary path. There is often a gap year in between and, when we track gap year students, we frequently notice that ENS students no longer rely on the extra year as much in order to be able to graduate from college. This tells us that we are doing better in elements such as writing, research, communication, and understanding what it takes to be successful in college. One of our graduation requirements is a cumulative project that spans essay work and volunteer work driven by the student's interests. We are increasingly seeing a great deal of creativity in those projects, leading to a higher degree of success than in the past.</p><p><strong>How does ENS integrate technological tools into its learning environment?<br></strong>ENS is heavily involved in STEM-based education using common core and next generation science standards, which is key for us. As we begin to look at the future and project what children need to learn, we must note our students are great with technology.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you walk us through the evolution of KIC?<br></strong>KIC was established in 1985 by Naim Alradi initially as a training center. It then developed into a fully fledged higher education college. We were the very first higher education institution to receive accreditation from the Ministry of Education and the Commission for Academic Accreditation (CAA). We have transitioned away from being a training center only to an international college that provides more structured, credit bearing programs and degree pathways. Our degrees are in applied practices in the areas of IT, business administration, mass communication, and health sciences. We are continuously adding to our curriculum and adding programs that reflect the demands of the local and global labor market.</p><p><strong>How do the forces of market openness and intensified globalization affect your education programs and how do you approach curriculum design?</strong><br>As a higher education institution, our priorities are aligned with the 2030 Strategic Vision. Moreover, to ensure relevancy and compliance, we have to innovate and continuously review our existing programs to include disciplines and specializations that clearly align with this vision. We have also included in our IT program concentrations such as AI, cloud engineering, big data, and cybersecurity. As an institution, we are very much aware of the growing significance of AI in society and how the UAE has a global leadership role in the development of this technology and preparing leaders for the fourth industrial revolution. The college is fortunate to have a well-established IT department. Interestingly, we are in the first phases of bringing drone technology courses to KIC. We have also agreed with UK partners to bring engineering programs to KIC. It is our goal to bring a full suite of programs within the built environment domain.</p><p><strong>How do you expect demand to change in the domestic labor market in the next 10 years? <br></strong>Higher learning institutions need to respond to these changes by providing an agile and relevant curriculum. At present, we are exploring different fundamentals in IT, not only AI and drone mapping, but also cloud engineering and cybersecurity. We are also advancing our health sciences offerings, where we are now introducing respiratory care and emergency medical care. These two programs have already submitted their CAA applications for final approval. CAA has visited the campus and listed the requirements. Significantly, these two programs do not exist anywhere else in the region. We are collaborating with the Cleveland Clinic, and we recently signed an MoU with Danat Al Emarat Hospital for Women and Children. Our future plans for health science programs include comprehensive nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy, and sonography programs. There are also plans to develop programs to support dentistry.</p><p><strong>How are you using smart technology in the college, and what are the expected outcomes of this adoption?<br></strong>Across our operations, we apply the standards of the e-learning suite. We also have the Moodle system for our students. We are discussing using VR and AR in our practices and delivery. One of our programs, computer graphic design, can actually help in developing the AR model. In 2020, we plan to launch an international foundation year, which will need a physics and chemistry lab. Using VR and AR, we can build these labs. We can also apply this technology to health sciences. Smart technology increases memory capacity and speeds up how we capture knowledge and comprehension. Consequently, this has vast potential with our construction programs, where we can build up scenarios for HSE on campus through building information modelling, which is the future of construction. The fundamentals are similar to VR, based on being able to see the details of the design. In the region, people still prefer face-to-face teaching rather than online courses. This is why virtual and augmented reality should be viewed as an aid rather than a replacement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the curriculum and university developed to meet the demands of the economy? <br></strong>Khalifa University of Science and Technology combines the capabilities of three major universities—Khalifa University of Science, Technology, and Research; the Petroleum Institute; and the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology. The combined institutions are technology-driven with three specialized schools, including one in petroleum exploration technologies and one in sustainability, green energy, and advanced technologies. Consequently, the combined university offers more comprehensive programs. The university follows closely the economic developments of various sectors in the UAE, the government's strategic plans, and the drive to grow a knowledge-based economy. The university assesses those aspects and either introduces new programs or enhance existing programs to have graduates with the required level of knowledge and skill set. Furthermore, Khalifa University fully supports the UAE's drive toward clean energy through most of the engineering programs that it offers. The degree programs from the bachelor through the PhD cover the various facets of efficient energy generation and distribution as well as sustainable development. Oil and gas remains a major sector of the UAE economy, and Khalifa University is supporting that vital industry with highly qualified graduates in petroleum, chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering. In addition to this, we have has strong capabilities in the vital area of ICT. The university aims to build its curriculum further, and to that end, the College of Science has introduced a bachelor's degree in physics. Plans are in place to develop life sciences, as it is underrepresented, although it is crucial for the country's future. We try to link our courses directly with the economy.</p><p><strong>What is your assessment of the current level of research in ICT, aerospace and technology, energy and environment, healthcare technologies, and security?</strong><br>Khalifa University has some of the most advanced faculty experts in AI and blockchain fields, and that is a reason we were one of the Pride of Zayed Award 2018 winners at the UAE Pioneers Awards. We were recognized for being the national hub for scientific research and introducing meticulously planned programs that meet the employment market requirements in Abu Dhabi and the UAE. We have several ongoing research projects in aerospace, energy and environment, healthcare, and data security. In the UAE, the Khalifa University team will be working on various initiatives with industry partners on the defense of smart cities from cybersecurity attacks. Research on blockchain taking place in the Center for Cyber-Physical Systems (C2PS) targets new approaches to ledger programming and the development of innovative blockchain application. Recently, we launched the Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems Institute (AI Institute), the third research institute at our university. Focusing on academic programs in AI development, continuous professional development, and research centers, the AI Institute will bring all research in robotics, AI, data science, and information and communication technologies under a single umbrella. In addition, we also launched a program in AI designed for non-computer science and non-computer engineering majors. It will provide students with the required knowledge in AI and related skills to serve the UAE government agencies and the industry. Meanwhile, the Khalifa University Center for Robotics and Autonomous Systems (KUCARS) is emerging as a top international robotics research lab, with around 50 researchers and state-of-the-art laboratory facilities, conducting pioneering research in robotics relevant to industry and society. The research is focused on three complementary themes: infrastructure inspection, extreme environment, and industrial applications. Khalifa University is also building a world-class marine robotics facility, with wave and stream generators.</p><p><strong>How important is it for students to develop entrepreneurial skills, and how does the university allow students to diversify career paths? </strong><br>There are core classes that students must take, and we try to instill entrepreneurial thinking, to get students mulling on the feasibility of business concepts from the beginning. Core business and project management skills are integral as is financial management. On the SME side, biomedical is still a growing industry in this part of the world, although the pharmaceutical industry is relatively well developed. Within the biomedical sector, there is the soft and hard side, such as robotics, genes, and genetic research. Remarkably, Khalifa University announced the first-ever licensing of its patented technology to a start-up floated by an alumnus Emirati entrepreneur with a faculty member. This is in line with the university's strategy to look at where the market is going. Notably, our students are applying their research to real-world scenarios and trends, and in that sense, we encourage our faculty to apply for funding from the relevant industry. Equally important, after registering the patent and project disclosures, we encourage faculty and students to open companies, which happens through the Khalifa Innovation Center (KIC). The focus is solely on technology companies with expectations that these companies will bear fruit in the coming years.<span></span></p><p><strong>How do you engage locally and globally with other universities, and what is the significance of this engagement?<br></strong>International partnerships are key for any university, and to that end, Khalifa University hosted the Asian Summit of Universities in April-May 2019. Strategic partnerships with Asia have been extremely important, and in collaboration China Scholarship Council (CSC) we have launched the region's first program, enabling up to 30 Chinese students each year to pursue their PhD studies at Khalifa University. Similarly, the university has strong partnerships with the Korean Institute of Science and Technology, with which we have partnered to host a joint research center, the MIT, and the China University of Petroleum-Beijing, in addition to the University of Tokyo. Khalifa University has signed two agreements, one with King Abdul Aziz University to widen cooperation and develop sharing of information in scientific research and another with King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) to continue the joint work on advanced research as a valuable resource to support innovation. Khalifa University has signed an MoU with Russia's National Research University, one of the largest technical universities of Russia, to further strengthen the long-term partnership, specifically in innovation and research-related activities. We also have collaborations with several international universities in Asia, Europe and North America.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>INNOVATION IS ONE OF SCG'S CORE STRENGTHS</strong> in achieving its global standard targets and Made in UAE focus. In particular, it recognizes it is amongst a unique small percentage of companies successfully making innovation a core business driver. In a recent survey of global executives, 84% acknowledged that innovation is extremely important to their growth strategies. How- ever, an astonishing 94% were unsatisfied with their own innovation performance. The harsh reality is that the vast majority of innovations fall far short of ambitions. Historically, only 20% of all new products and services that enter the market were successful, and only 10% of business start-ups survived. Within those that do survive, improvements are made, but often on the wrong things—plenty of activity, but little productivity.<br><br></p><p>While SCG initiatives like Vulnerable Witness Evidential Recorders, Emergency Services Command and Control Centres, and Smart Patrols may appear to be all about technology, the secret is that its SCG innovations are ultimately all about understanding people, the needs of the community, and the government. Using our SCG employees—who are highly trained as change agents in the discipline known as the science of systematic innovation with the distinctive name of Sigma Force. This is based on a unique, powerful synthesis of the Lean Six Sigma methodology and other scientific disciplines. Each employee within the SCG Sigma Force is equipped with evidence-based management and performance optimization skills. Their Sigma Force ranking of captain is based on both their level of Lean Six Sigma proficiency and the economic benefits they have achieved for the company.<br></p><p><br>Through a systematic structured innovation approach and the SCG Sigma Force, based on a recognition of the economic benefit achieved to the company, SCG has created an incentive-based and skills-based performance and innovation management framework that doesn't just talk innovation, but makes it a core part of everything it does.Through this approach, SCG provides a performance management and innovation framework that enables its employees to become great employees, its leaders to become great leaders, and Emiratis to become great Emiratis.<br>Key success factors within the SCG innovation framework are:</p><p><strong>INNOVATION AS A SYSTEMATIC BUSINESS PROCESS<br></strong>SCG does not wait for the “Aha" moment of epiphany. It invests and develops its staff in the systematic innovation process and provides the appropriate performance management/Sigma Force incentives to live and breathe innovative and creative thinking.<br></p><p>In truth, everyone is capable of innovation. Innovation is a systematic business process that brings out innovation in everyone when put correctly in place. Provide the right innovation incentives, and processes and innovation will flourish. Those who understand and master this possess a distinct advantage over those who do not.</p><p><strong>NOT ONE APPROACH FITS ALL<br></strong>At a given point in time, SCG focuses on delivering three different types of innovation through its internal systematic innovation Sigma Force agents. It focuses on:</p><p>(i) Innovation that delivers new-to-the-world products, services, technologies, and information delivery systems;<br>(ii) Innovation to improve existing recognized products, services technologies, and information systems; and<br>(iii) Innovation to incrementally improve existing SCG internal processes and delivery systems.</p><p>Each type of innovation requires a different skill set and systematic approach. SCG's Sigma Force agents are proficient in all three.</p><p><strong>INNOVATION DRIVEN BY NEEDS FIRST, NOT IDEAS FIRST<br></strong>Early in his career, inventor Thomas Edison learned why a needs-first approach to innovation is superior to an ideas-first approach. He spent an incredible amount of time, effort, and resources inventing the world's first electronic vote recorder. This brilliant innovation was met by a completely uninterested market. This painful and costly failure taught Edison a lesson that forever shifted his innovation approach to a needs-first process. As a result, he put himself in the shoes of his targeted buyers, literally travelling to their workplaces and homes to analyze their tasks and discover where their struggles and pain points might be. He applied the innovation process to those areas.</p><p>SCG applies this needs-first strategy as a fundamental concept within its systematic innovation approach to public safety. We focus on important needs of the community and government, including:<br>• Safety within the home, when outdoors, or commuting;<br>• Emergency services support, when and where it is needed;<br>• Consistent and fair enforcement of law and order;<br>• Timely follow up and investigations; and<br>• Strong community outreach and confidence in the system.</p><p>In each of these areas, it drills further down to reveal the hierarchy of critical public safety needs to which it applies its systematic innovation methodology.</p><p><strong>NOT CONFUSING SOLUTIONS WITH NEEDS<br></strong>A common misconception that often hinders innovation can be seen in a popular quote from automobile inventor Henry Ford: “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."<br>The key here is to recognize the error of mistaking a solution for a need. If we look closely, we see Ford himself was not talking about customer needs. Consider it re-written as, “If I had asked people what solution they wanted, they would have said faster horses." The horse is actually a solution, not a need. This reply came from the customer because Ford's question was poorly crafted, predictably eliciting responses that are framed around solutions (i.e., products, characteristics, and features) rather than needs.</p><p><strong>ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS<br></strong>To determine its customers' needs, SCG goes behind the traditional mindset that people “buy" SCG products and solutions. Instead, it realizes that they actually “hire" its products and services to get an important job done. If SCG does the job well, clients will hire that same product again in the future. However, clients will also review its offering with newer solutions and innovations over time. This is where the “hire" concept comes in. As innovation and technology drive better solutions, clients will “fire" its previous solution and “hire" the next new, innovative solution if it better solves their existing or changing needs.<br>This is why SCG asks “What job did they hire that product to do?" and “What are the obstacles and frustrations the customer encounters when executing such jobs?" SCG use these needs-first identification questions for successful innovation and product/service support.</p><p><strong>BRINGING IT TOGETHER<br></strong>Knowing the right questions to ask, SCG's Sigma Force has combined its expertise in public safety, technology, and AI with the science of systematic innovation in order to create breakthrough solutions that its customers really need. It has begun to interview and interact with potential customers in new ways, successfully unveiling not only hidden unmet needs, but also under-served needs and overshot needs for the first time. Its customers are noticing. Its existing products are better at meeting real customer needs. SCG's new product development is more focused, and its delivery systems are smarter and leaner. It has become an exciting part of the organization, and with this success, more and more SCG staff seek to join its Sigma Force.<br>SCG is also regularly demonstrating its innovations to many delegations visiting its SCG headquarters. Guests always enjoy seeing such innovation from a UAE-based subject matter expert. Just as more and more SCG staff wish to become Sigma Force change agents, so too will more companies wish to learn about its science of systematic innovation. SCG strives to be the champion of real innovation. It is pioneering growth initiatives within the UAE by applying the science of systematic innovation to public safety. It is also committed to sharing its knowledge across other entities to further promote innovation competency across the UAE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of Gulf Precast and its positive impact on the construction sector?<br></strong>Gulf Precast has the largest precast manufacturing capacity in the UAE, with six plants and dozens of construction sites being developed at any point in time. At present, thanks to the initiatives taken by the public sector, we are working on new schools, hundreds of villas in Mirfa, a port extension, an airport extension, a data center in Al Ain, a presidential guard command center, and a prison. We are also participating in numerous private projects, ranging from villas to high-rise towers, factories, mosques, and shopping centers. With 35 years of experience, Gulf Precast is involved in extremely diverse construction projects, both in the UAE and in neighboring countries. Precast is similar to Lego construction. The pieces are manufactured in our factory and transported to a construction site where they are assembled. This technology enables for better, faster, safer, and more environmentally friendly construction.</p><p><strong>What are some of the notable projects that you have been involved in?<br></strong>We have been played a key role in the Emirate's growth over the past 35 years. Some of the notable projects we have done in Abu Dhabi are the Midfield Airport Terminal, New York University, Mariam Um Issa Mosque, and Al Wahda mall. We have also been engaged in infrastructure projects such as roads and bridges, including projects for Etihad Rail and the oil and gas sector. So far, we have completed over AED6 billion worth of projects. Our work always starts with a phase of study carried out by the 50 engineers in our technical department. They ensure the structural soundness of the project and design it in a way that maximizes safety and minimizes construction costs.</p><p><strong>With the oil price stabilizing and renewed optimism in the market, what opportunities do you foresee?<br></strong>For a company such as Gulf Precast, a long period of market slowdown is highly damaging. Over<br>the past three years, the government has reduced its spending drastically, and as a result, we were running at 15 to 20% of our capacity in Abu Dhabi. We are hopeful that the government will be releasing about AED60 billion in construction projects and a similar amount in oil and gas projects, providing a much-needed boost to the construction industry. In order to revitalize the construction sector, the government should not only launch projects, but also ensure the fluidity of the payment system. The precast industry is suffering from an endemic lack of cash liquidity, as the first progress payment certificate is received after site assembly, while expenses related to design, production, and transport have already been incurred. It is thus critical for the government to settle the construction work on time and ensure that the main contractors pay their subcontractors on time.<br><strong><br>How do you see increased sustainability regulations helping the precast sector?<br></strong>Sustainability is directing construction toward precast solutions, which are highly sustainable products. They provide thermal insulation and meet many criteria in terms of Abu Dhabi's sustainability drive. They also ensure better long-term product quality, as all elements are produced under strict quality control in a factory environment. In addition, most of the raw materials used in the manufacturing process are sourced in the UAE or its neighboring countries, reducing the carbon footprint considerably.</p><p><strong>What is the impact of technology on the precast industry?<br></strong>Numerous new materials and technologies have been recently developed, such as nanotechnology and carbon reinforcement. The government plays a critical leadership role in this. In the forthcoming projects, the government should impose the use of new technologies that can enhance the sustainability of the projects, even at a marginally additional cost. Gulf Precast has a strong reputation for successfully using state-of- the-art solutions by capitalizing on its engineering capabilities and experienced employees. For example, we were selected to assemble the first 3D-printed construction in Dubai.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of CERT's educational management philosophy?<br></strong>CERT is the training and corporate arm of the Higher Colleges of Technology (HCT), which is the largest higher education institution in the UAE. Since its foundation in 1996, CERT has been at the forefront of human capital development as a trusted and proficient education partner. CERT's national skills programs combine immersive and impactful training delivery methodologies and focus on practical, job-oriented education and career success. We are committed to delivering the highest standard of excellence, while also striving to foster an environment where every learner realizes his or her potential as valued members of their organizations and the wider society.<br><br><strong>What are some of the ways you cooperate with the private sector and specific industries?<br></strong>CERT's long-term success in training and education relies on its agility and responsiveness to the rising investment in human capital. The UAE labor market is one of the most diverse in the region, reflective of a fast-paced, globally competitive economy, where 70% of the GDP originates from non-oil sectors. As the corporate arm of HCT, we are in a unique position of convergence of industry, government, and academia. This allows us to design programs according to the latest developments in the field, enhance the employability of the national workforce, solve real-world problems, and address skills gap. Our model of workforce development benefits organizations across all Emirates and sectors. One flagship project in 2019 was our collaboration with Mubadala Investment Co, in the design and execution of the Train for Work Program. This initiative prepared 1,000 job seekers with business, employability, English, and ICT skills, prior to their deployment to Mubadala enterprises. CERT actively engages with strategic sectors and organizations such as the oil and gas industry. An increasing number of organizations entrust us with leadership programs that seek to identify, develop, and coach high-performing aspiring managers in specialized retail sales positions.<span></span></p><p><strong>The UAE is leading in the adoption of innovative technologies. What role does CERT foresee in this new landscape? <br></strong>The UAE is a leader in the formulation of national strategies to promote the adoption of transformative technologies in key areas of the economy. The UAE's strategy for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the National AI Strategy 2031 are roadmaps for the integration of AI, blockchain, automation, and nanotechnologies in healthcare, government services, transportation, energy, education, mobility, and other essential sectors. We believe that the key to success in the activation of AI strategies starts with people and the development of their skills for the jobs of the future, prioritizing the interface between machines and humans.</p><p><strong>CERT has had many successes in the creation of localized bespoke technology solutions such as CERT Telematics and its state-of-the-art transport management system. How do you see CERT further enabling and contributing to the UAE's 4IR?</strong><br>CERT and its subsidiaries, CERT Telematics and CERTSOFT, have been market leaders and innovators in the technology sector. Since 2008, CERT Telematics has been a key market player and technology disruptor in the smart mobility and transportation sector of Abu Dhabi. We foresee a significant role in enabling and contributing to the digital economy, spearheading innovations for our clients in the transportation, energy, aviation, e-government, and judicial sectors. Through our 360-collaboration model, we leverage AI technologies, sustainable platforms, data, and networks, localized to the Middle East and the UAE, and reflective of global technology trends. CERT Telematics was the first to implement navigation services for public transport in the MENA region. Our solutions focus on four areas: IoT-enabled in-vehicle devices, AI-enabled taxi management system, fully automated dispatch solution, and an intelligent call center solution. Notably, CERTSOFT provided the Sheikh Zayed Desert Learning Center with a sustainability communication platform. The solution displays real-time energy consumption, with visualization dashboards for electrical, water, solar, and other metered building services, integrated with the building management system. Through our solutions, the center recorded a 59.4% energy saving in one year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does Agthia's current portfolio reflect demand in the UAE's food and beverage market? <br></strong>2019 marked another exciting year for Agthia Group. This coincided with an overall sector-wide observation that consumer habits have rapidly changed; people have now become more health- and cost-conscious. At Agthia, our primary focus areas are quality, brand awareness, and product availability. Companies that do not prioritize these fundamentals experience significant challenges. In 2018, we launched a few new innovations and in 2019, we started focusing on the pharmaceutical industry. At present, we supply our Al Ain Zero Bromate bottled water to hospitals for pregnant women and people with kidney issues. Also, our Al Ain Bambini baby water, which was initially launched in the Saudi market, was introduced in the UAE with a formula that is gentle on a baby's digestive system.</p><p><strong>What strategies do you have in place to build brand awareness?<br></strong>Understanding consumers and their specific needs is a major priority for Agthia. Our teams work continuously with focus groups to develop products according to customer needs. We also invest substantially in R&amp;D. This is what makes us an industry leader. In addition to this, we also build brand equity through innovation, value addition, and sustainability. At Agthia, we believe in creating shared value for all our stakeholders. As a leading food and beverage company, food sustainability is one of our key drivers and priorities. We focus on three key pillars to achieve this: social, economic, and sustainable production. In 2019, we were the first UAE company to open a food packaging R&amp;D center. This plays a significant role for two reasons: one is that we can optimize packaging to reduce food waste, which is critical for us; and second is the sustainability factor of the packaging itself. We cannot rely solely on packaging techniques used in Europe or the US as packaging in this region gets exposed to high temperatures. It is, thus, vital to seek innovative approaches to localize R&amp;D initiatives.</p><p><strong>What role can an organization like Agthia play in terms of preventing food waste?<br></strong>Agthia's R&amp;D center has been exploring methods to develop packaging solutions that protect its contents and extend shelf life. We are the only organization in the GCC that implements the high-pressure pasteurization (HPP) technology for our Al Ain Fresh Juices. This ensures that shelf life can be extended with minimal loss of flavor and nutrition. For example, if you expose juice to heat, it loses its vitamins and flavor. But HPP sustains the flavor, so the juice still tastes fresh after 28 days. It is safer and less likely to be discarded after a few days, which is one of the ways we are reducing food waste. Food waste is a challenge in the FMCG industry at large, because goods nearing the end of their shelf-life tend to get rejected. We have started working closely with food banks in the UAE and Egypt to use products that are still fit for consumption and donate them to avoid food waste.</p><p><strong>What role does Agthia play in the UAE's food security strategy?<br></strong>The UAE National Food Security Strategy 2051 aims to achieve zero hunger by ensuring access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year-round. The strategy specifically aims to bring the UAE to the top of the Global Food Security Index by 2051 and among the top-10 countries by 2021. Agthia is an active member of the Food Security Alliance, and it contributes 40% to the national food security basket, making it the largest supporter. Furthermore, we work toward the food security requirements to find other sustainable resources, such as meat alternatives and vegan products. We also have around 60 food distribution outlets in the UAE to make food more accessible. Food security is not just a government endeavor. We have demonstrated that commercial organizations can play a significant role in this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does ZÜBLIN-STRABAG position itself in the UAE market?<br></strong>The majority of the group's turnover is generated in Central Europe and through special infrastructure projects around the world. We define ourselves as a niche contractor in the UAE focusing on unique building and infrastructure projects, such as tunneling, rehabilitation works, and so on, which require specific technical skills and expertise.</p><p><strong>What qualities define an ideal project for the group in the UAE?<br></strong>We are highly selective when it comes to the projects we undertake and the companies we work with. One of the defining elements of our work in the UAE is the level of maturity of our clients with respect to both their payment schemes and the engineering challenges they face. Our edge is that we bring significant knowledge, experience, and skills based on more than 100 years of experience in the engineering and construction sectors. We favor clients with an ability to appreciate an international contractor who can deliver quality in a timely manner and brings ideas that provide the best value for money. We are not margin-driven and are used to long-term, stable partnerships. Our relationships with authorities or semi government investors are built on value engineering and trust.</p><p><strong>How does ZÜBLIN-STRABAG keep its busi</strong><strong>ness model adaptive and resilient in light of the UAE's market cycles?<br></strong>In the UAE, we are a relatively flexible organization, and we seek to keep our branch office margins as low as reasonably possible. We have a relatively big engineering group in the Middle East, however we also rely on our head office's technology input and the strength of our chain of vendors, suppliers, and subcontractors. Even if we experience payment or contract issues with our clients, we ensure our sub-contractors are paid. This is unusual in the Gulf market but results in our partners preferring to continue working with us. Our technology department in Central Europe also helps us keep costs down by looking for ways to achieve high-quality output in a cost-effective and efficient manner.</p><p><strong>How would you assess the evolution of environmentally conscious construction in the UAE?<br></strong>Environmental sustainability and energy efficiency are major challenges for the future of UAE, and there is a great deal of room for the green building sector to develop. We endeavor to be a market leader in ecologically sensitive projects. We are currently involved in tenders promoting energy storage schemes and zero net-energy buildings focusing on the implementation of stringent international sustainability parameters. For such projects the support of our R&amp;D and Engineering Hubs in Central Europe is essential and we are therefore able to provide, together with our local presence, solutions which are state of the art yet manageable.</p><p><strong>What are some of the greatest cost pressures in the UAE?<br></strong>I have been here for a long time and have seen many spikes in the market. The main problem is that there is little clearance of bad contractors in the market. If the market can correct itself, then prices would be more viable. If there is a high number of competitors compared to the real work available, then there will always be a race to the bottom. Our strategy is to stick to solvent, mature clients so that we can mitigate our risks and keep our organization as lean as possible.</p><p><strong>What policy recommendations would you provide to create more stability in the sector? <br></strong>Companies need to be made more responsible for financial accountability. This would help major clients or the government to establish a few strong partnerships under new contract models such as partnering models with modular programs, allowing the appliance of specific contracting rules for local authorities, semi government entities, or investors. Such schemes can be compared to existing models through scoring systems identifying opportunities and advantages to the employer.</p><p><strong>What is your approach toward Emiratization?<br></strong>We are an international group but we want to rely on resources available within the host country first. In general, we welcome Emiratization initiatives, as they make excellent use of the national talent studying abroad and give them opportunities beyond the public sector. We have employed some Emiratis, and in the long run I am sure they will play a big part in our work.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us more about Trust Construction and how it started in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>Trust Construction Establishment was established in 1985. It is an ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, and ISO 45001:2018 certified company. We do design, engineering, procurement, construction, and installation and commissioning of civil works, as well as mechanical, electrical, and plumbing projects. Trust Construction is now classified in Abu Dhabi as a Category 1 company. We have done a great deal of work in the UAE, mainly with governmental and semi-governmental agencies such as the Ministry of Defence, Tawazun Economic Council, and CICPA.</p><p><strong>Have you had issues with on-time payments in recent years?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi has introduced contractor classifications, and one of the main issues we focused on in the process was creating standardized levels against which to compare the capabilities of different contractors. Other Emirates have their own systems, though they all come down to classifying the companies based on size and capabilities so that clients can make a better choice. There are still numerous issues in the industry, particularly with respect to payment, but the majority of these cases happen in Dubai; how- ever, this is somewhat normal for a developing industry like ours. The issue becomes exacerbated when major real estate developers flood the market with new projects without considering the demand. This causes markets to operate sub-optimally. There should be a professional policy about awarding contracts so that contracts are not awarded to those who cannot execute them properly.</p><p><strong>How does the company's business model help it survive the boom and bust cycles inherent to the industry?<br></strong>The number-one priority is to stay liquid. We are one of the most liquid companies in the industry, and this is one of the reasons why our clients prefer to work with us. The liquidity translates into prompt payment, which everyone appreciates. Additionally, we are strict about quality, on-time delivery, and other factors, which does not make us the most popular at times with our sub-contractors. However, our sub-contractors like to be paid on time, and they are more than happy to live up to our high standards if prompt payment is what they get in return. Cost has to be seriously calculated, and assumptions should always be eschewed in favor of facts. There are many unexpected costs that arise during the course of project, and these must be accounted for in the beginning of the project. We normally calculate 2-3% as contingencies, and this gives us a margin of safety. There are a great many calculations that need to go into assessing the profitability of a project. When contractors bid our projects too low, then both parties end up losing. It is better to lose one job than every job. When companies put in too many tenders for too many jobs, disaster is often the result.</p><p><strong>What are some important things to bear in mind when working for clients in the public sector?<br></strong>Working with the public sector, especially defense, is demanding, and it is not for everyone. There are barriers to entry that some people cannot overcome. Additionally, companies have to comply with the timing and schedule of the government. This is a tough space to work in, though the best thing is that the money is guaranteed. The process can take some adjusting as well, though after a company has learned the rules and requirements, it can be a great space to operate in. From a financial point of view, we are the strongest company in the market, and that makes us extremely attractive to work with.</p><p><strong>What is your outlook for the UAE construction sector?<br></strong>There are positive signals in terms of the UAE's new residency rules. There are ambitious population goals in the UAE, and I applaud these efforts. We will see a great deal of immigration that will give stability to the system. I expect things to be great for both the industry and the country in general. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of NMDC and its contribution to the development of Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>NMDC is a homegrown UAE company that was founded in 1976, and over the past four decades, it has been instrumental in the economic, infrastructural, financial, communal, and social development of Abu Dhabi. Our work transcends different sectors and contributes to the advancement of energy, trade development, and the growth of real estate and tourism. Our projects in wet infrastructure, environmental protection, and sustainability have also had an enduring impact. Throughout many of these activities, we have worked in close collaboration with key Abu Dhabi stakeholders such as Abu Dhabi Government, ADNOC, Musanada, and Abu Dhabi Ports.<br><br><strong>How has NMDC's approach to the market evolved in recent years?<br></strong>Our objective in recent years has been to consolidate and engage in opportunities overseas. We have clearly defined our target markets; this is primarily the UAE, then the GCC, followed by the wider Middle East region. We are bullish on the Indian market. Our studies led us to narrow down the UAE, Egypt, and India. Our expansion efforts have intensified since the successful completion of the Suez Canal project in 2014 and the upper Zakum project building. These two landmark projects have strengthened our reputation as an international industry leader. We have several projects in the pipeline in the UAE and Egypt, where we now have a majority market share. Recently, we completed a legacy project in the Maldives. NMDC has chosen to invest wisely in the organization to ensure resiliency against external fluctuations and economic unpredictability. By applying resilient measures and reducing fixed costs, we are able to resonate more with clients. We have the confidence and the trust of clients to be successful even against aggressive competition.</p><p><strong>What are some of the distinguishing features of your energy projects, and how will NMDC play an integral role in the future development of the sector?</strong><br>NMDC has a strong relationship with ADNOC, and we have built long-term, strategic relationships with many of the other major stakeholders across the energy sector. This has been solidified through the successful completion of many significant projects. For example, we are building one of the largest projects in oil field development along with 11 islands for gas production. This is a significant indication of how ADNOC trusts us to meticulously execute complex projects. We have also completed the construction of the Barakah artificial reef in partnership with the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC).<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How would you assess the current level of adoption to sustainable waste practices by both the public and by businesses in Abu Dhabi?</strong><br>Tadweer is building momentum and expanding sustainable practices throughout Abu Dhabi by opening further facilities that can treat special types of waste. We are in the final process of opening licensing for electronic waste recycling, with the next phase being plastic and wood recycling. Moreover, we have been awarded three hazardous and medical waste treatment incinerators, one in Al Ain and two in Abu Dhabi, which helps to attract the private sector to waste management, besides its impact on the safety and sustainability of the Emirate. To raise public awareness of sustainable waste management, we have a dedicated awareness section to communicate our messages in different languages. Our winter campaign involves raising awareness about littering in the desert. We also send awareness representatives to livestock farmers to educate them on better waste practices, such as providing simple and understandable awareness materials. We also engage with schools, households, government entities, and farms. Consequently, we have observed increased awareness among the public. There has also been an increase in the number of people calling our hotline to request services, with 80,000 requests registered in 2018.</p><p><strong>What is the significance of the new waste management efforts in Al Dafrah?</strong><br>Recently, we opened a mobile crusher plant in Ghayathi that diverts around 90,000 tons of construction and demolition waste whose recycled products are used for infrastructure projects. In Al Dafrah, we reached almost 1 million tons of waste. Our strategy is to increase the diversion of waste across the emirate of Abu Dhabi. It currently stands around 34%, with the goal of increasing this to 85%. The main challenge in reaching this target is that the waste is not collected separately due to a lack of segregation at the source by producers. Even on construction sites, many workers do not separate food waste, and everything ends up in one container. Therefore, we need to enforce the segregation of waste at the source. We are hopeful that increased awareness will inevitably help change behavioral practices as we look ahead, which will ultimately assist us in achieving our strategic goals of diversion of waste from landfills.<br></p><p><strong>What outreach initiatives are you engaged with that specifically target y</strong><strong>ounger people, and how can we create further youth awareness of sustainable waste practices? </strong><br>Tadweer initiated a school's program five years ago, and we present a prize and certificate every year for the schools with the best recycling footprint. Schools are a particularly critical area, as we wish to foster environmentally sound waste practices at an early age. We are working with schools that have internal waste segregation by providing them with waste bins for plastics. There is a new initiative in the pipeline to have an application specifically for schools. This would require every individual school to register students, and annually we will calculate the best school based on their recycling footprint per student volume.</p><p><strong>What digital and technological solutions are you currently pursuing?<br></strong>Interestingly, we are developing a control room that uses GPS to track contractors with a monthly service plan. With a set KPI per contractor, and the GPS tracks if targets are being met based on routes and collection times. There is an additional plan for street sweeping. Placing cameras in trucks helps us monitor waste to determine if it is bulky, green, or illegal; however, as we cover all routes in the Emirates, this will be expensive. Finally, we would like to have onboard weighing per truck, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and a database where we know how much waste comes from each house.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of ADSSC and its core activities in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>ADSSC was formed in 2005, and our job is to be the main wastewater services provider in the Emirate. ADSSC operates about 40 treatment plants, over 300 pumping stations, and around 8,000km of pipeline across Abu Dhabi. All of our treatment plants treat wastewater to a high standard, meeting regulations for recycled water's reuse for “unrestricted" irrigation. Since 2005, we have spent over USD4.9 billion through our CAPEX investment scheme, including the Strategic Tunnel Enhancement Program (STEP), which cost approximately USD1.6 billion. Furthermore, we have grown our staff to over 600 people, of which 89% are Emirati. Our mission is to continue collecting wastewater and treating it to a high standard and be recognized as a world leader in sustainability, innovation, and efficiency in the provision of sewer services.</p><p><strong>STEP has been one of ADSSC's flagship projects in the last decade. Besides STEP, what other critical projects has ADSSC overseen across Abu Dhabi?</strong><br>We have completed more than 80 projects over the past ten years varying in size from simple collection networks, new and upgraded treatment facilities, a billion dirhams worth of recycled water transmission assets, and large trunk main augmentations schemes. We are currently constructing a replacement deep gravity sewer that will serve Khalifa A all the way to Shahama and onto Yas Island. This will allow for the decommissioning of the Yas Island treatment plant. In Muroor, we are removing two pumping stations in the central market area and have just finished the Baniyas deep trunk sewer, which cost approximately AED600 million. There are approximately 50 pumping stations that will be decommissioned because we have replaced them with deep gravity “interceptor" sewers, all of which will connect to the STEP integrated system. We have spent over USD135 million on collection network rehabilitation over the past five years. This has been a significant focus of our investment program, due to old and dilapidated sewers in some catchments. The capital program seeks to create further efficiency across the network, with an emphasis on rehabilitating existing assets and upgrading them, including pump station rehabilitation and treatment plant upgrades. These upgrades will see the introduction of newer technological innovations. We try to get the most out of existing assets, while also striving to reduce our carbon footprint.<br><br><strong>The city of Abu Dhabi is highly urbanized, with pressure from population growth, climate change, and resource scarcity. How are you adapting your operating model to cope with this?</strong><br>It can be a challenge to plan efficiently in a city that has an underlying growth of indigenous Emirati and transient expatriate populations, temporary workers, and increasing tourist occupancy. We have completed several master plans, although it is hard to predict geopolitical conditions and economic circumstances in this region, which are highly influenced by commodity price fluctuations such as the price of oil. Our CAPEX program has to be fully justified and prioritized while delaying investment until the optimum 'trigger' time. This way, we strive to get the most utility out of existing assets, maximize asset performance, and push the standards of sewer design to our benefit. With regard to population growth, we are fortunate that our treatment plants can process in excess of their design limit. Sewage in Abu Dhabi is mostly residential, with a small industrial element. We have recently seen flows decrease, possibly due to pressure on potable water tariffs and subsequent behavioral changes. We anticipate that the road corridor towards Dubai is going to get further developed, and we will most likely split our currently centralized catchment to cater to this.</p><p><strong>What is ADSSC's perspective on the best ways to leverage innovative technologies?<br></strong>We are exploring the use of asset data and introducing sewer failure prediction models. With diverse data systems, we intend to predict when a pipe will burst. This will allow us the deal with it before any collapse occurs. This will all be based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS), using spatial data, digital CCTV data, and hydraulic models.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you explain how the establishment of Masdar fits within Abu Dhabi's wider diversification strategy both for the energy mix and broader economy?</strong><br>Masdar was established with a mandate to expand the UAE's energy portfolio by advancing, commercializing, and deploying future energy and clean technologies. We have known for a long time that our hydrocarbon resources are finite—the future is a diversified energy mix, a cleaner and more sustainable economy, and less dependence on fossil fuels. This evolution will continue to be driven by the strategy of the government of Abu Dhabi. While Masdar's main objective is to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel power generation, it is also contributing to diversifying the economy. Since its establishment in 2006, Masdar has combined its unique access to talent and capital to create a new source of economic value for the UAE. Today, it is helping commercialize technologies in solar power, wind, sustainable real estate, and waste-to-energy, while also striving to help the UAE and other countries we are active in to achieve their sustainability goals.</p><p><strong>What benchmarks has Masdar set domestically?<br></strong>For Abu Dhabi itself, the target was to have 7% renewable energy by 2020, and I am glad to say the government has achieved this. In fact, by January 1, 2020, we will have more than 7% renewables within the energy mix. The vision and strategy are there, targets were set, and the institutions responsible for achieving these targets achieved them. This was one of Masdar's mandates from an energy strategy perspective, though another of our roles is to invest in renewable energy, technologies, and a cleaner future.<br><br><strong>How does Masdar's international investment strategy complement its renewable energy goals and mandate?<br></strong>From the outset, it was crucial for Masdar to learn about different technologies and make the necessary investments in them. Accordingly, it was essential that we understood how renewable energy policy works in other developed countries, so we realized we needed to invest overseas and bring this expertise back to Abu Dhabi. We have focused on solar—including concentrated solar power (CSP) and photovoltaic (PV)—and wind, both onshore and offshore. We have brought much of this competence home, which adds to what we have already learned and allows us to develop further capacities and technologies in different areas. In Serbia, for example, we have built the largest utility-scale commercial wind project in the western Balkans. Moreover, we became involved in the offshore wind business as part of the group developing, building, and operating the London Array Offshore Wind Farm. Today, we are a partner in other large scale-wind projects in the UK. Masdar has been a key player in promoting offshore wind and CSP technologies with thermal storage, many of which were not bankable when we invested in them. Furthermore, we are now exploring electric storage for large-scale utilities. We have also since set new benchmarks for cost-efficient renewable energy, most recently in Morocco, where Masdar, EDF Renewables, and Green of Africa successfully bid to develop the 800-MW Noor Midelt Phase I solar plant combining PV and CSP technology and thermal storage. In January 2020, Masdar and EDF Renewables won the 400-MW Du- mat Al Jandal project, Saudi Arabia's first and the Middle East's largest wind energy plant. These projects and initiatives are important, and eventually all of this knowledge will benefit Abu Dhabi. As a global company, our footprint will also continue to grow. Our ambition is to become one of the largest renewable energy and sustainable development companies in the world.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

Al Masaood's strategy was to align our activities with the government's vision, which is how the company grew. Our services are diverse and cover a broad spectrum in the sector, while we also have a substantial oil and gas-trading arm. We also represent and partner with more than 70 international companies in the UAE under agency partnership agreements. We aim to be a family-orientated company with a global presence that maintains international standards. Our proactive business approach means we actively explore opportunities in other regions, most of which are based around trading and services. For example, in Algeria and Turkmenistan, our business developed from selling safety protective products to service contracts.</p><p><strong>What are some of the core services you provide across the UAE, and how do you anticipate these will evolve?<br></strong>Some of our primary services in the UAE include plant maintenance, asset integrity, corrosion monitoring, drilling services, safety services, engineering, consulting, design, and commissioning. As for our in-house services, we provide tubular running, air drilling services, plant maintenance, corrosion engineering, NDT, and auditing. We have been involved in trading for many years and are proud to represent remarkable international brands such as safety, mechanical, electrical, and chemical products that are used throughout the industry, as well as other sectors such as construction and municipality works. Interestingly, we have ambitious plans to start manufacturing along with services for training, catering, and logistics. These services will enhance our in-country value. We wish to expand our offshore logistics services, namely supplies for offshore vessels. We are expanding the size of our jetty from 140m to 520m to develop and integrate these services. We plan to integrate our operations away from the city center. It will be beneficial to have our employees' amenities such as accommodation, canteens, and a shopping center along with a guest house for VIPs, training center, exhibition center, trading warehouses, and head offices all in one area. This facility is called our Megabase project and will create efficiencies in manpower, logistics, and operating costs. In short, it will be like a mini-industrial city.<br><br><strong>How have recent concession agreements impacted your decision to scale up services? <br></strong>ADNOC's announcement of the five-year expansion plans will have an overwhelming effect on the local sector, with AED500 billion to be invested in the oil and gas sector for the upcoming five years, 70% of which will be spent on downstream and 30% on upstream. Al Masaood can add value to this expansion plan. ADNOC has been quite clear about its in-country value (ICV) expectations for both local and foreign companions. It wants local companies to invest and gather expertise from foreign ones. ADNOC has formed partnerships with many international companies, which is encouraging as it incentivizes local players. The ICV program has a significant influence on both foreign and domestic organizations engaged with the sector.<br><br><strong>What work are you doing in regard to cost optimization and life cycle challenges?<br></strong>Cost optimization has been a lucrative segment of our business for decades. Now that it is time to give back, companies with massive profits have to regulate margins. Several organizations did not optimize or make discounts, and as a result, lost substantial business. If a company has a proper product, solution, or service that meets ADNOC's prequalification and registration processes, the doors are open for newcomers and competition. The whole industry is being positively affected.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>From a business continuity standpoint, how has Ankaref's work in the healthcare sector and across the economy been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic?</h4><p>For 10 years, we have been trying to establish infrastructure for a crisis like this. Ankaref works with a number of different sectors, so its ability to continue operating depends on where you look. For example, the company has ongoing business with the Ministry of Health, which is important; therefore, we are prioritizing our work with the ministry and focusing more on the health sector. The vaccine industry is in the spotlight now as the world searches for a COVID-19 vaccination. Ankaref has been working in the vaccine sector for a while now—our Vaccine Cold Chain and Inventory Tracking System (ATS) monitors 12,300 inventory locations and the cold chain system. Sensors track temperatures and locations of vaccines and connect via our call center if there is a problem. In addition, within the healthcare sector, we have patient and staff tracking systems, a medical inventory tracking system, and hospital textile and central inventory management systems.</p><h4>Outside of the healthcare sector, how have Ankaref's operations been impacted?</h4><p>Another key element of our operations is our concrete tracking service. While construction activity has slowed as a result of the pandemic, business is ongoing and our team is focusing on the cloud software management side. This enabled us to provide our service from home. We are relying heavily on the cloud for business continuity across our services, in sectors like defense, manufacturing, and logistics. Our smart home products are doing very well as everybody is now at home. We have end user products that can easily be sold on the internet and through mobile applications. In Turkey, some government institutions and private companies are still operating and they are looking for solutions during the epidemic.</p><h4>What new solutions is Ankaref introducing to assist in a situation like the ongoing pandemic?</h4><p>Given that the need for health services will continue to increase, Ankaref is developing solutions for the effects of COVID-19. We are especially focused on developing new solutions for telehealth. In the coming weeks, we will introduce a new online system with face-to-face patient observation. Using this system, patients will be able to have an online conference with doctors and even get advice or prescriptions. Notably, this system is applicable in all sectors. Numerous trends that were underway before the current global shutdown will only accelerate because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For us, it means we will focus more on telehealth.</p><h4>Over the long-term, where are you expecting to see the most growth for Ankaref?</h4><p>The most important future market is the consumer market. By 2025, the average device quantity will be 20 per person. This take into account devices in consumers' homes that track things like temperature, humidity, gas control, and water flow. The gateway will be smart phones, and through the broader rollout of 5G, the consumer market will be increasingly accessible. After the crisis, life will go on but there will be an increased focus on developing smart cities. Cities that had smart solutions and were able to track people better have come out of the crisis in a better condition than those that didn't. We are working to address future demand for smart city solutions.</p><h4>What is Ankaref's strategy for international growth?</h4><p>From the start, our strategy has been to develop solutions for the Turkish market and then tailor and bring those solutions to foreign markets. For many years, we have been doing business in the Middle East but Europe is a more difficult market to enter because of the requirement differences. We have done a lot of international projects in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Egypt, and we are also present in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, who are asking for vaccine tracking systems. In the Turkish consumer market, we are present in approximately 3,000 Turkish houses. If we can increase that number to 20,000, we will have the scale to go to other countries for distribution. Turkey's relations with other countries is highly important for our export operations. Bilateral relationships with Middle Eastern countries impact us, so we would like to see strong ties and good diplomacy so that Turkish exporters can succeed.</p><h4>What are Ankaref's most important institutional strengths that will allow it to grow in the future?</h4><p>Process knowledge and data collection experience will be important for us in the future. In different fields, we have different teams of consultants with deep process knowledge — as companies continue along the path of investing in and implementing IoT solutions, our knowledge will be sought after. Then, as our solutions expand and grow, the data we gather will become more and more important. After COVID-19, our strategy will not change significantly, but we're expecting to see an increase in business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been some recent milestones, and how is your range of services poised to meet the demands of offshore marine?<br></strong>In respect to our recent milestones, in 2019 we achieved our target of entering subsea contracting services with our major clients by securing four commitments, three long term and one spot, within the UAE. For the most part, this market has not seen any new entrants in quite some time, making such milestones significant. We have proven through our expertise on these subsea service contracts that we can step up to be a market leader. We are building upon our existing resources in house, both personnel and assets, and look forward to securing a larger market share in 2020. This addresses the second part of your question, the development of our new subsea division. Here, we are on a clear path to becoming a fully integrated solutions provider to the offshore industry, having built a diverse asset base. This transition means we could be categorized as an EPC contractor, but what will differentiate us is the ability to rely upon our own assets and internal expertise to perform these contracts</p><p><strong>As ADNOC announces new concessions, engages international partners, and increases production, how will offshore service providers meet this new demand?</strong><br>As any service provider would, they must increase their asset and service base in order to meet the demand. For ZMI, we are not only continuing our strategy of acquiring new assets at low prices, but also entering into partnerships and JV agreements to ensure we can meet the increasing demand we anticipate for this coming year. As for critical factors, it will all depend on how competitive one wants to be. With the Southeast Asian and North Sea market and their respective projects coming to light this year, we will see some deficit on the supply side for good assets, which will help prevent pricing levels from dropping.<br></p><p><strong>How will your business model adapt to the government's policy outlook for the energy transition and diversifying the broader economy?</strong><br>The public perception with this question is that it assumes the inevitable is going to be a non-oil economy. That's far from the truth. The reality is oil and gas is here to stay; what will move is the general consumption of oil and gas. We see the focus shifting to downstream and its related products, which means that even though the population will eventually get its energy demand from alternative sources, not just oil and gas but renewables, the reality is that overall demand will continue to increase as the national and global population grows. It's a shame that climate change activism, which is necessary to ensure we do move toward a more sustainable future in energy demand, is actually placing a black marker on the industry. Rather than educating the public on the necessity of oil and gas, climate change activists are chastising it.<span></span></p><p><strong>Where do you see the greatest opportunities abroad for offshore marine services companies from the Gulf to apply their expertise?</strong><br>While the Gulf will remain our core focus and our home market, we see Southeast Asia and East Africa as viable future markets. We have just signed an exclusive JV agreement with ENH logistics, the government entity of Mozambique that sees the offshore oil and gas market, for 25 years of marine services. This is a strong step toward securing the right business partners and ensuring we enter the market both sufficiently and sustainably.</p><p><strong>What new technologies are you exploring or deploying throughout your operations?<br></strong>The largest impact in offshore and marine services is big data collection, management, and analysis. Typically, onboard ERP and equipment have many onboard data collection points, so it is essential to collect it in a live timely manner by carefully implementing secure networks between the fleet and HQ. The final stage is data analysis, which is vital for understanding and tailoring data to report to key decision makers for optimum operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are the mandate and core activities of EAD?<br></strong>Our environmental work in Abu Dhabi began over 25 years ago. Today, our mandate is to regulate sectors and enforce environmental laws aimed at protecting the UAE's natural heritage. We develop and implement environmental protection and conservation programs, applying these at the individual level as well as more broadly in public and private sectors, such as agriculture and energy. Our impact extends globally, and we have sustained several international partnerships that are helping us achieve our goals. Moreover, we have monitoring programs collecting data in areas like carbon emissions, the status of endangered species, as well as air and water quality. By making credible research accessible to decision-makers, we have facilitated the creation of robust laws and policies.</p><p><strong>What are the distinguishing features of Abu Dhabi's environment compared to other parts of the UAE?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi's environment is so unique and diverse. Before joining the agency many years ago, I thought our environment was mostly a one-dimensional desert environment with little natural life. I was surprised, however, to discover the diversity and richness of our native biodiversity despite our harsh and arid climate. We have more than 400 plant species and over 3,000 fauna species. Abu Dhabi's marine waters are home to some 3,000 dugong, the second-largest dugong population in the world after Australia, and the largest indopacific humpback dolphin population in the world. From this understanding, we can devise regulatory laws to protect Abu Dhabi's natural heritage and environment. We have a rigorous permitting process in place for industrial development activities, ensuring environmental impact assessments are carried out and mitigation plans set if deemed necessary. We have a substantial network of 19 protected areas that we are proud to call the Sheikh Zayed Protected Areas Network, while UNESCO, Ramsar, and IUCN Greenlist recognise many of these sites internationally. We are immensely proud of our world-leading reintroduction programs for endangered species and have managed to improve the status of several species, including the Arabian Oryx. Previously considered threatened, thanks to the efforts of the UAE, the Arabian Oryx is now considerably less vulnerable.<br><br><strong>What are the areas of greatest sensitivity and threat across Abu Dhabi's environment?<br></strong>The coastal areas in Abu Dhabi are the most sensitive since they are home to a variety of habitats such as sabkhas, salt marshes, sand beaches, mangroves, and more, but are also the focus of much development work. Therefore, we must be careful in regard to coastal developments and industrial activity around the coastline. The coastline, recognized as part of our heritage in the UAE, was historically the only gateway to our nation and an important route for trade. Moreover, mangroves, a critical coastal habitat, are incredibly important for carbon sequestration as demonstrated by a study conducted by EAD in collaboration with Abu Dhabi Global Data Initiative (AGEDI) on Blue Carbon. We found that these mangroves absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide; thus, playing an important role in climate change reduction. They also play a role as fish nurseries and as natural barriers to storms. Since Abu Dhabi Emirate is home to 70% of the UAE's mangroves, it is essential to protect them, especially since most of the mangroves are about 25 years old, which is beyond the minimum age of 15 when mangroves start to realise their greatest carbon storage potential.</p><p><strong>What are some of the most vulnerable areas today?<br></strong>One of the most vulnerable habitats in Abu Dhabi worth mentioning is Jabal Hafit, the Emirate of Abu Dhabi's only mountain. It is home to many endangered and endemic species that do not exist elsewhere in the emirate. Recently, we spotted the Arabian caracal there, which has not been seen for over 35 years, and a rare dwarf palm.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You were recently included in the eighth cohort of the Casablanca stock exchange's elite program. What pushed your company to be a part of it?</h4><p>It is a choice that was made by the stock exchange. The program takes place over two years; the first year is about training the managers and the second year focuses on a specific subject, such as strategy or governance. This, of course, depends of the type of the company. We are in our first year and have undergone the technical training part. Once we have successfully completed the second phase, we look forward to exploring the different types of financing options that the stock exchange will present to us.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the experience so far?</h4><p>We have completed the first module, which we found really interesting. Notably, there was a set of companies that are about the same size as us. What is important is the exchange between all the managers, especially at the training level. Overall, our experience was great; the framework, supervision, and training were all of the highest standards.</p><h4>CMM is present in several other countries. Are there plans to expand into more markets?</h4><p>At present, we are operating in five African countries. We have a real development strategy for the future of Africa. Since Morocco is our country of origin, we are present here and are developing our local activities and presence. One of our main targets is the health sector. We have carried out quite a few projects, including the first oncology center in Mauritania, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso, an emergency hospital in Mauritania, and a clinic in Abidjan. It is safe to say that CMM has a strong presence in the health sector. Recently, we had a turnkey contract including medical equipment for a hospital in Burkina Faso. It has been a fruitful experience so far and we hope to develop it even more. Africa represents between 15 and 20% of our total turnover. There are more opportunities in Africa than in Morocco because the competition in Morocco is getting tough. With this in mind, we are targeting the African market for our expansion. That said, we intend to continue our expansion in Morocco. Our turnover from the Moroccan market grows 20% every year on average.</p><h4>Why makes Morocco such a competitive market?</h4><p>Morocco has developed a lot over the last 20 years. There are quite a few national companies that have become leaders, even international leaders. There was a time when there were no local companies capable of building highways or dams, but at present, Moroccan companies can handle any kind of project.</p><h4>What has been the impact of digitalization on your business?</h4><p>Digitalization has had an enormous impact on our business. At CMM, we are leveraging digitalization to develop our internal programs and keep them up to date.</p><h4>What impact has payment delays had on your operations?</h4><p>Payment delays has become a national nuisance. A company that is not paid on time cannot be expected to invest. We have found our way around this challenge because of our healthy cash flow, allowing us to keep honoring our commitments to suppliers and collaborators. Almost 80% of the dividends remain within the company. On a national level, the government is working with all the stakeholders and relevant authorities to fight this problem. The laws were always there, but they were never enforced. Fortunately, the government is now applying penalties in case of late payments to change the mindset.</p><h4>How do you train your workforce?</h4><p>We train our employees about new methods and techniques. For the technical team, we mainly hire fresh graduates and give them on-the-job training. One project manager can train two to three technicians at a time.</p><h4>Do you export your know-how?</h4><p>All the managers for our Africa operations are hired and trained in Morocco. In Africa, there is an abundance of manpower, but we struggle when it comes to finding quality craftspeople. For example, when we take on turnkey projects, it's difficult to find the right talent in Africa, especially when the Project Owners request for Moroccan style design.</p><h4>What are your strategic objectives for 2020?</h4><p>Our primary goal is to maintain our growth rate and explore other countries in Africa. We have a number of projects in the pipeline. Sometimes, consultant from different countries approach us directly. We also participate in calls for tenders and we recently took part in an Afri Santé exhibition in Ivory Coast.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about Morocco's textile industry?</h4><p>The textile and apparel (T&amp;A) industry plays a key role in Morocco's economy. Aside from being the first industrial employer in the country accounting for around 180,000 jobs, the T&amp;A industry is one of the few sectors that employs a large number of women and young people. Contributing to 15% of Morocco's industrial GDP, it is also a sector that plays a leading role in the trade balance, representing 25% of the country's goods' exports. Morocco is recognized today as a key player in the fast fashion supply chain given its longstanding and established experience with the biggest vertical fast fashion brands and retailers in the world. One of its major competitive advantages lays in the proximity with Europe, and therefore its ability to react immediately to new trends to be delivered in short lead times and in flexible quantities.</p><h4>Is Inditex present in Morocco?</h4><p>Inditex is one of the biggest clients of the Moroccan T&amp;A industry, accounting for a significant part of the sector's employment and exports.</p><h4>What is the importance of international partnerships for AMITH?</h4><p>We are in a global, international industry with players in our supply chain geographically dispersed across the world. It is hence important for AMITH, as the representative of the Moroccan Textile &amp; Apparel Industry, to have strong international partnerships, not only to promote the Moroccan T&amp;A offer to international buyers, but also to improve market access conditions to our products.</p><h4>How has the competitiveness of the sector evolved since 2014?</h4><p>The T&amp;A sector adopted in 2015 an innovative and ambitious strategy, resulting from a strong, effective and unprecedented public-private partnership. This strategy is part of the 2015-2020 Industrial Acceleration Plan, and was built around targeted, clear, conscious and aligned choices between the State and the profession. It aims at making the Moroccan textile sector a leading player on the continental scale and around the Mediterranean. The combination of a conducive international environment and the ambitious national strategy has given the sector a new impulse, which is not limited to exports, but also to investment and employment. Four years after the implementation of the national T&amp;A strategy, the sector has created 70,000 jobs and generated more than EUR800 million additional exports.</p><h4>How was 2019 for the textile sector?</h4><p>After recording an average annual growth rate of 5% since 2012, exports of Moroccan textile and garments to Europe have stagnated in 2019. This adverse performance can be explained by the less preferable market access conditions granted by the EU to Moroccan exports in comparison with countries such as Turkey and some Asian and African nations, which enjoy duty-free access to European markets.</p><h4>What can the government do improve relations with the EU?</h4><p>We have been trying, for almost a decade now, to get more favorable access conditions to the EU markets. Indeed, when countries from Asia or Turkey can export garments to the EU without paying duties regardless of the origin of the fabric used to manufacture them, Moroccan garments pay duties on their FOB prices if fabrics used are originating from outside the Pan Euromed region. This means that duty is paid not only on the imported fabric, but also on the added value generated locally in Morocco, which is totally unfair. Fully aware that any change in the rules of origins with the EU has to be decided at the political level, members of the Moroccan Government have showed their support to our position and have started talks with European officials to help us turn the tide in our favor and level the competitive playing field between Morocco and some of its major competitors.</p><h4>What other strategies are your working on?</h4><p>The diversification of target markets is one of our strategic priorities. Today, France and Spain account for more that 50% of our T&amp;A exports, whereas the Moroccan presence in northern European countries remains too shy. This is why, several promotion actions are planned for the near future to increase the penetration of Moroccan T&amp;A in these markets.</p><h4>What sustainability initiatives are you implementing?</h4><p>Morocco embarked on the sustainability path several years ago when we made our first 100% Made in Morocco 100% sustainable Denim collection. Several investments in equipment allowing for a more sustainable way of production were made in the industry, and factories are increasingly considering renewable energy alternatives to reduce their energy bill. In addition, projects are launch to establish a recycling ecosystem in the T&amp;A industry to close the loop, reduce the impact of our production on the environment and offer sustainable production alternatives to brands and retailers.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>Few weeks ago, I could have responded with all confidence to your question. Unfortunately, with the COVID-19 pandemic inflicting to our industry worldwide what could be qualified as the worst blow in its history, our goal today for what is left of 2020 is first damage control. Then, depending on how things evolve with the pandemic in Morocco which took strong measures very quickly to contain the spread of the virus in the country, and in the rest of the world, we'll adjust. But one thing is sure: the Moroccan T&amp;A will be there when COVID-19 is defeated to stand by the side of its international partners and relaunch together our industry when this crisis is over.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has the 80-year relationship between Total and the UAE evolved over time?<br></strong>Our relationship with the UAE has evolved through time, and we probably have the largest footprint of any international oil company in the country. We are now present in oil, gas, solar power, lubricants, and desalinations. Our ambition has three main axes: First, we bring ADNOC our expertise to help it reach its production target of 5 million bpd by 2030. As an asset leader in some fields, we contribute to optimizing production and developments in the most profitable and efficient manner, using our talents and our technology. Second, we work to unleash the gas potential of Abu Dhabi, in line with the gas self-sufficiency objective of the country. Third, we contribute to lower carbon intensity in the energy mix, both through our activity in renewables, solar in particular, and through energy efficiency of the oil and gas operations, in line with Total's global ambition to provide affordable, sustainable, and clean energy to the world.</p><p><strong>How will your business model evolve in the coming years to adjust to global renewables targets?<br></strong>As we are committed to supplying reliable, affordable, and clean energy, we will focus on diversifying the energy mix toward more renewables and gas, while reducing the energy intensity of our operations. Globally, we have around 7GW of power capacity worldwide, of which 3GW are renewables. It is our ambition to reach 25GW in 2025. Significant progress will need to be made to achieve this target. In parallel, gas will be needed to allow an increasing share of renewables on the power grid. For solar, the good thing in Abu Dhabi is that we tend to have peak demand when we have peak sun. We remain focused on the large solar farms, as we were a pioneer in he UAE through our Shams project in the early 2000s. There is also more potential in rooftops. In 2018, we set up a team in Dubai responsible for developing distributed generation, and it has succeeded in installing around 70MW. For gas, we are bringing our technology and experience to unleash Abu Dhabi's gas potential. One example is our partnership with ADNOC on the unconventional in the western part of the country. In addition, we are continuously striving to help produce oil and gas in an efficient manner and to lower the carbon intensity, ambitions we share with ADNOC. These fundamentals will shape our relationship in the future.</p><p><strong>What innovative technologies are you currently exploring and deploying across your operations? <br></strong>Digitalization and its associated technologies enable organizations to be leaner and also give them the opportunity to test quickly on a smaller scale. A good example is the smart drones that we used to acquire seismic data in partnership with ADNOC. This technology is exciting as it means sending fewer people on-site, resulting in less complicated logistics. Instead of a large team, we only require a few pilots, drones, and an automatic vehicle to get the best data. Consequently, this is cheaper, safer, less CO2-intensive, and human error is removed from the system. Furthermore, Total as an organization is a big believer in AI and its capabilities for the industry. We recently signed a research partnership with the Sorbonne University Abu Dhabi in the area of AI applied to production processes. We want to bring AI experts in close vicinity to the UAE's industry. In Abu Dhabi's onshore and offshore operations, you have thousands of wells, valves, processes, and pipes that all provide data; this is where AI can bring significant optimization opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Wintershall Dea come to position itself in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>Wintershall Dea (Wintershall merged with Dea in 2019) has been in Abu Dhabi for almost 10 years, and the decision to enter the market was driven by opportunity. At the time, the Abu Dhabi Na- tional Oil Company (ADNOC) offered us a project to drill in the Shuwaihat field. We were delighted with the opportunity, as it was an ideal moment to showcase our excellence in such a sensitive environment, especially with respect to our expertise in hydrogen sulfide. After successfully completing the drilling and appraisal of our two wells, onshore and off- shore, our team was tasked with finding opportunities to continue our business in the UAE. We were grateful when the next step came in the form of the Ghasha Concession, in which Wintershall Dea now has a 10% stake. We are confident this 40-year concession, covering a huge area, will bring a lot of interesting developments.<br><br><strong>How will the merger of Wintershall and Dea enhance the company's work in the Middle East?<br></strong>Last year, Wintershall and DEA completed their big merger. Now as Wintershall Dea, we are Europe's leading independent gas and oil company and only in a position to grow all the further. In the past we had already partnered on several projects, including our 50-50 partnership in the Mittelplate development, an artificial island in an environmentally sensitive area in the Waddenzee in northern Germany. Building on this excellent working relationship and combined knowledge, our merged company will continue to focus on developing fields in complex areas.</p><p><strong>What makes Wintershall Dea a unique player in Abu Dhabi's oil and gas sector? <br></strong>Wintershall Dea's differentiators include, but are not limited to, its long experience and technical expertise in the sour gas domain. Having successfully developed sour gas fields in Germany for over 50 years, Wintershall Dea is a<br>strong geology, geophysics, and engineering-driven company. We also excel in working from exploration rather than making large on- and offshore fields into brownfield developments. For Wintershall Dea, the success of a project comes beside the described operational excellence from strong, collaborative partnerships, and the prospect of developing more of these in the Middle East is what has brought us here.</p><p><strong>How does Wintershall Dea maintain its technical edge?<br></strong>In recent years, Wintershall Dea has come up with many different ways to ensure we develop our capabilities with new technologies and expertise. We maintain skilled networks around the world composed of people from diverse operational environments working across different levels, analyzing challenges and formulating solutions. If the solutions are effective, we integrate them into our best practices and guidelines and make them fit-for-purpose to apply them to our core regions around the globe. We are dedicated to collaboration and durable workflows. This is what we are pursuing in our Ghasha project now. We are also looking at the entire value chain in surface and subsurface, and use our technology competence center in Germany to provide solutions for operational challenges in chemistry, petrophysics, or other areas requiring specific analysis. One innovation we made, for example, established a digital alternative to the classic and time-consuming core analysis, called Digital Rocks. This uses different techniques to generate a digital visualization of a reservoir that goes down to a scale of a single nanometer. It is a unique asset, and we are happy to deploy it in Abu Dhabi. Using this digital model, we can better predict previously difficult properties of the reservoir such as relative permeability or wettability, which will help optimize exploitation of the existing field and significantly accelerate the evaluation time and decision making process for how to best further develop the field. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is becoming the smartest effort to secure the well-being of both mankind and nature. By definition, CSR denotes various forms of voluntary activities organizations carry out to achieve economic and social goals, adopting and encouraging a positive impact on the environment where such organizations operate. The recent sense of corporate in CSR extends to beyond commercial, profit-making entities to cover not-for-profit organizations and even government agencies. Under the current unprecedented rapid growth in the awareness of the importance of CSR, the future of many organizations is becoming largely reliant on how far entities are committed to practicing the concept in countries where they operate.</p><p>For the past two decades, organizations everywhere have been involved in a CSR marathon to achieve sustainable development in their societies, environments, and nature at large. Many innovations and creative activities have been introduced to bring novel initiatives to better people's lives, build development infrastructure, and protect the environment.<br></p><p>In the UAE, an internationally recognized top philanthropic country by the World Giving Index (WGI), the government envisions making a drastic change in the concept of CSR, moving from merely contributing to charity activities to launching well-organized development initiatives. To achieve its CSR goals, the government aims to establish creative sustainable development projects in line with the country's strategy for improving humanitarian, social, economic, and environment levels.</p><p>In its race toward total sustainable development, the UAE government launched a CSR track as a part of its National Strategy for the Year of Giving 2017 under the umbrella of its Ministry of Economy. With this strategy, the country is striving to achieve sustainable development through effective partnership between official government authorities and private-sector entities. Such partnership springs from a long-term vision to deepen the culture of development and social work throughout the country.</p><p>To carry out the strategy, the CSR UAE Fund was formed under the UAE Ministerial Cabinet decree to raise awareness about the values of CSR, to launch and coordinate a sustainable development partnership between the public and private sectors, enhance the CSR framework, create a CSR privileges framework, and engage corporations to contribute to community development projects. Other programs launched to achieve the UAE's CSR objectives include the CSR UAE Smart Platform, a national portal built for corporations, non-profit organizations, and government agencies to take an active part in initiating sustainable development projects, initiatives, and programs adopted by the government. The CSR UAE Index, an annual performance measurement index of CSR and sustainability practices in the UAE at a micro and macro level, was also launched. Macro-level rankings will come from comparing 32 sustainability indicators grouped under the six areas of sustainable economies, human capital, community development, responsible procurement and supply chain management, climate action and sustainable consumption with other countries. Micro-level rankings will measure and analyze CSR and sustainability practices based on the value and impact of their contribution to the UAE's national sustainable development priorities and other social and environmental programs. Additionally, we have begun activating CSR Networks, a city-based coordination platform to boost collaboration between nonprofit organizations, public and private sectors, and enhance each emirate's CSR agenda.</p><p>In all these endeavors, we draw inspiration from the words of late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, founding father of the UAE, who said, “The real wealth is hard work that benefits the person and the community." Being a responsible business in the UAE now has a clear institutional structure, and many milestones have been achieved since CSR's adoption in the National Development Strategy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the most significant initiatives that the Ministry of Economy has recently overseen?<br></strong>The UAE has adopted a pioneering, flexible, and open economic policy in order to build a diversified, sustainable, and highly competitive economy based on knowledge, innovation, technology, and R&amp;D, in line with the UAE Vision 2021. In this regard, the issuance of the new FDI law by the UAE is of great significance in terms of incentives provided to foreign investors in the country. The new law allows up to 100% foreign ownership of companies in selected economic sectors, including agriculture, industry and services, innovation, technology, scientific research, and other creative fields. Most recently, the introduction of the “golden card" permanent residency scheme by the UAE government grants long-term residency status to investors, businesspeople, and talented professionals. To further complement these efforts, local governments at the Emirate level have launched new packages of incentives and facilities to attract investment inflows to vital sectors. Among the most prominent of government decisions taken recently to stimulate and enhance the country's business environment is the cancellation of a mandatory bank guarantee for private sector companies once their employees' residence permits are confirmed. Instead, the new system of employment insurance will be worth AED60 annually, instead of AED3,000 for the previous bank guarantee. Apart from exempting transit tourists from all fees for the first 48 hours, facilities have been granted for those wishing to obtain employment opportunities in the country, through a temporary residency permit for a period of six months without fees. Additionally granted is a provision for talented students to extend their residency for two years after graduation, which will allow them to explore their future options in the country.</p><p><strong>How does the rising level of trade protectionism throughout the world affect the strategic planning of the ministry?<br></strong>Protectionist trade policies have adverse effects on global trade in general, and we are not immune to it. Considering its strong partnerships with the US and China, the UAE is keen to remain impartial, and we earnestly hope that consensus will be reached to curb this trend because it hinders global trade prosperity that benefits all parties. The UAE remains committed to pursuing a policy of openness and partnership with various countries. This approach is based on our strong belief in the values of openness and eradicating barriers, which will enable us to protect the country's commercial interests, thereby limiting the impact of these tensions on the UAE's economy. Simultaneously, we will continue to work with friendly and partner countries to revoke trade restrictions through bilateral, regional, or global legislation and agreements. Exploration of new economic destinations and diverse markets to increase exports, promote re-exports, diversify destinations for imports to build stronger trade partnerships, and further economic cooperation is another major focus area. In addition, we are continuing our efforts to find solutions to the problems arising from protectionist policies through consultative channels and mechanisms adopted by the WTO. As for the steps taken to facilitate the access of exports to international markets, the Ministry of Economy supports the movement of Emirati goods to foreign markets through the National Committee for Export Development, which has the membership of all federal and local authorities concerned with this vital sector. The ministry also participates in many meetings and platforms, most notably joint economic committees, which bring countries together with trade partners in order to enable the private sector to explore trade opportunities and new markets, and successfully address challenges.</p><p><strong>Over the next decade, what role do you see the UAE playing in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and what advantages will this bring to the national economy?</strong><br>Since the BRI's inception, the UAE has been actively participating in all forums and activities associated with it. China's foreign trade with countries along the BRI reached approximately USD298.2 billion in 1Q2019, up 7.8% from 2019 and accounting for nearly 28.6% of China's total foreign trade in 1Q2019. A number of promising development projects have been announced in connection with the BRI as well. Furthermore, the UAE's expertise and accumulated experience in the field of logistics services and successful experiences in areas such as free zones, infrastructure, and port management are also being leveraged to ensure the success of these projects. China has invested nearly USD64 billion in countries located along the BRI between 2014 and 2017. These investments are spread across 50 countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, with two of the mega projects in the UAE. The projects are Traders Market, an international station for the BRI in Dubai with USD2.4 billion of Chinese investments, and Vegetable Basket in Dubai, worth USD1 billion. The UAE recently launched the World Logistics Passport initiative to open new paths for trade between the East and the West and enhance Dubai's and the UAE's ability to support global trade and economy. It will position Dubai as the capital of the new economy in the region and will help accomplish the ambitious target of generating USD2 trillion in revenue in Dubai's non-oil foreign trade by 2025. The initiative will help achieve these goals by boosting trade and enhancing demand for the UAE's national exports, services, and integrated transportation systems and will contribute to the efforts to implement the BRI.</p><p><strong>SMEs are playing an increasingly central role in the development of the knowledge-based economy. How does the ministry work to encourage and support UAE-based entrepreneurs, start-ups, and SMEs?</strong><br>The pace of development of the UAE's SME sector is characterized by the adoption of international best practices and establishment of strategic partnerships with developed countries. These efforts have successfully linked SMEs and all economic sectors through federal and local specialized institutions and have resulted in strong partnerships with the private sector. This in turn has contributed to building an integrated SME ecosystem that focuses on commercial production through multiple economic activities that form the basis of smart transformation. Based on state data, the contribution of the SME sector to the country's GDP for 2018 is estimated at 53%, up from about 49% in 2019. SMEs also play a significant role in sup- porting the country's economic diversification, as evidenced by their 70.5% contribution of non-oil sectors to GDP in 2017. With intensified diversification efforts, this figure is set to rise to 80% over the coming years. It is clear that the sector will continue to be a major driver in advancing the country's diversification policy. The ministry is keen to support all initiatives for the sector and launch more privileges and incentives to encourage entrepreneurs of SMEs and start-ups. To help raise early stage venture capital or seed-funding to start businesses or to expand operations by showcasing revenue and growth potential to investors, 'AIM Start-up' was launched as part of Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) in Dubai. This international competition for emerging projects helps them showcase internationally. Besides, AIM provides a dedicated platform to connect entrepreneurs with investors. The initiative 'Emirates Initial Investors Association' was established to invest in emerging companies across all sectors, especially in the field of innovation and technology.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-mandate-to-maneuver]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How does the company's operating mandate in the UAE differ from its other global operations?<br></strong>Linde recently merged with Praxair, which was previously a competitor. This has significantly consolidated our global footprint, especially across the Americas, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. We are now a half-American, half-European organization with a 50% listing on the New York Stock Exchange and the other 50% on DAX in Germany. What's more, we have a new global senior management team that shares a strategic vision for the organization, especially its approach to the Middle East. We aim to grow our activity in the region and intend to leverage the positive reputations that both Linde and Praxair have to capture new market share. In addition to this, both entities are able to combine their resources and expertise. Overall, we have 1,300 employees operating under solely owned joint ventures in five countries, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman. We also have ambitions to supply technology solutions, industrial gases, and services to the chemical, metals, and energy sectors. The technological aspect of our work has allowed us to build successful references and will enable us to gain further traction as we look to the future with our local partners.</p><p><strong>How might your activities develop over the next few years, and what are your ambitions for the region?<br></strong>At present, there are some notable projects in downstream, especially with the integration between refining and petrochemicals, along with the value-added dynamics in chemical production. This is happening in Jubail, Yanbu, and Ruwais. This activity provides opportunities for technological solutions to facilitate the integration of the existing units and the supply of industrial gas. The further you go down the value chain, the more important industrial gases and associated services become. There is certainly more demand for sophisticated services across this cluster. Local players are not only willing to buy a plant; they also want to access and develop the associated technology and expertise to ensure long-term efficiency and value. In terms of R&amp;D, there is also the opportunity to partner with local companies and institutions, especially in the oil and gas sector. There are specific demands here, such as how to optimize the energy value chain, take better advantage of local resources, and integrate solar energy into the mix. There are concerns in the region over carbon emission; Linde is investing globally in carbon management and hydrogen mobility. We are receiving interest from local companies in this field and foresee significant potential with these solutions in the future. Overall, we see substantial investment in new technologies and expect this to continue over the coming decade.</p><p><strong>How do you see the energy trilemma, or the connection between energy, environment, and economy, playing out over the next decade?</strong><br>There is a need for sustainable energy and utilities solutions in this region. You have an abundance of sunshine and have the huge carbon reserves. Even with the new technologies in renewable solutions, we still have to rely on carbon over the next 50 years or so. You can define and implement a roadmap of the energy transition in combining carbon resources with carbon capture and utilization as well as solar energy. Energy and utilities remain essential to the industrial output of the UAE and its revenues from export markets. We are observing pilot projects that are testing the technology coming online. A large amount of innovative technology already exists; it's a matter of scaling up and finding options that work better. Engaging in long-term business relationships with countries like India, China, and Japan will also be essential. The UAE is working hard in this domain. Overall, I am optimistic that the region has the resources and capability to further unlock the full value chain and do so sustainably.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[getting-down-to-business]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How is the government working to encourage deeper cooperation between the public and private sectors?<br></strong>Abu Dhabi seeks to build a resilient and robust economy with a strong private sector; thus, solid relations between the private and public sectors is a must. As part of Abu Dhabi's development accelerator program, Ghadan 21, the Emirate has enacted a new law to promote PPPs through the Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), which was given the responsibility of leading the UAE's first PPP program, which will work with government departments to identify key projects that will benefit from a PPP model and bring them to fruition. The new law provides a new structure for regulating partnerships between the public and private sectors in Abu Dhabi, enhancing the Emirate's FDI strategy to support the participation of the private sector in certain key strategic sectors including technology, urban infrastructure, education, healthcare, housing, and transportation. ADIO will support investors in making commitments in line with Abu Dhabi's economic strategy and work with government and private-sector partners to use financial, technical, and regulatory criteria to screen proposed projects and assess their feasibility for PPP.<br><br><strong>What technologies will be vital to ensure Abu Dhabi's future economic growth, and what steps is the government taking to encourage investment in these areas?</strong><br>In line with Abu Dhabi's economic priorities, ADIO's objective is to create clear and specific investment opportunities for domestic and foreign investors aligned with our interests. In practice, ADIO is working to accelerate the advanced agritech ecosystem in Abu Dhabi and become a global leader in desert agriculture. To support this, ADIO has introduced a three-year program with up to AED1 billion in incentives for innovators within select agricultural technology sub-sectors to expand their knowledge-focused operations to Abu Dhabi. ADIO is awarding highly competitive and comprehensive cash and non-cash incentive packages for innovative companies within the agritech sector, including a rebate of up to 75% on all R&amp;D activities. Moreover, Abu Dhabi also offers various advantages to businesses and innovators, such as globally competitive tax rates, world-class infrastructure, the ability to handle high-volume commodities, inexpensive energy sources, and favorable tariff structures. The packages will be awarded to local and international companies that develop technologies to support precision farming and agriculture robotics, bioenergy, and indoor farming.</p><p><strong>What specific ways does ADDED work to encourage and support local entrepreneurs, start-ups, and SMEs?<br></strong>The importance of SMEs ranks high among the government's ongoing concerns for socioeconomic development. ADDED's progress in accelerating the establishment of a robust SME sector according to highest standards is achieved through building strategic partnerships with developed countries and establishing strong partnerships with the private sector. The government has announced a series of new initiatives to boost development in the private sector, including granting instant business licenses and access to loans for SMEs. The SME credit guarantee scheme will see more accessible financing opportunities provided to SMEs based in the Emirate through a guarantee provided by the government to Abu Dhabi banks. The scheme guarantees up to 75% of loan value, which will be provided to the bank in case of default, enabling banks to secure a certain level of lending to the market. It has been launched jointly by ADIO, the Department of Finance, and First Abu Dhabi Bank.</p><p><strong>What are some of the future plans in store for ADDED regarding sustainability?<br></strong>As we move ahead, and in line with global emerging trends, ADDED is keen to revitalize the economy by integrating structural reforms needed to foster strong, more sustainable, and inclusive growth and unlocking new growth engines. ADDED aims to enhance productivity by creating incentives for greater efficiency in the use of natural resources, reducing waste and energy consumption, unlocking opportunities for innovation and value creation, and allocating resources to the highest value use.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What significant policy initiatives did ADDED oversee in 2019?</strong><br>In line with Abu Dhabi's development accelerator program, Ghadan 21, ADDED has taken steps to promote the Emir- ate's economic development by creating an attractive environment for enterprise growth, competitive work environments, developing the private sector and SME growth, as well as stimulating industry projects. Central to this was the launch of Abu Dhabi Instant License initiative, where all licenses applications are streamlined through a digital portal, and approvals are processed instantly online. Furthermore, ADDED successfully launched its new Automatic Renewal initiative for economic licenses, allowing immediate license renewal via SMS, without the need to follow up and wait for approvals from the relevant entities. To expand our industrial base and reinvigorate our manufacturing sector, the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB), under the umbrella of ADDED, launched the Electricity Tariff Incentive Program (ETIP) in line with Ghadan 21's objectives. The initiative is expected to contribute to increasing companies' capitals, enabling them to further develop their industrial products, enhance their business value, and improve competitiveness. The initiative provides a discount to normal industrial tariffs for those sites with active industrial licenses and who fulfill certain criteria.</p><p><strong>What are the biggest concerns in terms of global trading trends?<br></strong>With 2019 marking one of the weakest economic expansions since the 2008 global financial crisis, 2020 will remain vulnerable to uncertainties over trade and geopolitical tensions. However, taking into consideration the trade deal announced recently by the US and China, which suspended new US tariffs on Chinese consumer goods and reduced the tariff rate on some other goods, we expect the deal to boost business confidence and investment prospects, contributing to a pick up in trade growth. Further cross-border cooperation is needed on multiple fronts. Countries should properly address concerns with the rules-based trading system and settle disagreements without raising tariffs and non-tariff barriers. External trade ranks high among Abu Dhabi ongoing concerns, with the Emirate continuing to invest in capital intensive, export-oriented sectors. Recently, Abu Dhabi has launched an export credit agency, ADEX, to support the Emirate's economy and enhance the competitiveness of its exports by providing funding and guarantees to overseas buyers—both public- and private-sector bodies—looking to import goods and services from the UAE. In addition, ADEX will provide credit facilities to support UAE exporters and help them manage associated risks, encouraging them to expand into overseas markets and explore new export destinations.<br><br><strong>How does ADDED work in partnership with other major government and non-government entities?<br></strong>ADDED implements its initiatives by working closely with government entities at the local and federal level, and with the private sector to enable the Emirate's enterprises and its people to realize their full productive potential. ADDED also coordinates with international organizations such as the World Economic Forum (WEF); Institute of Management Development, Switzerland (IMD); and the World Bank. These collaborations help to assess Abu Dhabi's potential for growth, investments, and to attract global talent; while the government uses them to evaluate policies underpinning the business environment and determine areas of legislation and procedural improvements.</p><p><strong>What have been some recent developments in Abu Dhabi related to green energy?<br></strong>As a key player within the world energy market, Abu Dhabi has extended its leadership among the renewable, clean energy market as well. In 2006, Abu Dhabi launched its leading clean energy company, Masdar, which spearheads the development of renewable energy projects and clean technology adoption. In 2017, the UAE launched Energy Strategy 2050, considered the first unified energy strategy in the country based on supply and demand. The strategy aims to increase the contribution of clean energy in the total energy mix from 25% to 50% by 2050 and reduce carbon footprint of power generation by 70%, thus saving AED700 billion by 2050. It also seeks to increase consumption efficiency of individuals and corporations by 40%<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What are some of the defining features of BP's operations in the UAE, and how will BP undertake deeper investment in Abu Dhabi?<br></strong>Our association with Abu Dhabi includes our joint-venture partnerships with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC), our 10% share in ADNOC Onshore, 10% share in ADNOC LNG, and our 10% share in the Natural Gas Shipping Company (NGSCO). This long-standing relationship between BP, ADNOC, and Abu Dhabi has developed over time. Having access to ADNOC onshore, the most significant asset in Abu Dhabi demonstrates how deep BP's commitment is to the Emirate. Moreover, ADNOC LNG forms a key component of our local strategy. Overall, it is an essential business model for Abu Dhabi. In addition to this, we are also exploring new opportunities and looking at how we can further invest in the country. ADNOC is interested in increasing oil production and increasing its exports of gas, and we are proud to be a part of that journey. BP is also helping ADNOC in many strategic areas; for example, we are helping them become more efficient and more performance-driven to deliver a safer and more reliable operation. We also have several secondary delegates working in various parts of ADNOC. With new partners entering the country, this is a healthy sign for the entire local industry. What's more, there is also considerable opportunity for the UAE and Abu Dhabi to realize the same kind of technological development that we have witnessed in other parts of the world. Fundamentally, we will be involved in helping increase oil production, bringing new technology, sharing best practices, and developing local capability. We also aim to explore conventional and unconventional means to enhance and build better value for our partners.<span></span></p><p><strong>How does BP use enhanced oil recovery (EOR) to maximize recovery from assets? Moreover, how do you assess Abu Dhabi's EOR targets?</strong><br>When we experienced a drop in oil prices, EOR was less of a priority for many organizations. ADNOC, however, was focused on how to best balance its operations while it was also evaluating the best approaches to EOR from a value-added perspective. BP focused on bringing technologies and techniques, like reservoir modeling, to support these efforts. Furthermore, we assisted ADNOC to establish a sub-surface center of excellence to develop their overall subsurface capability, in particular, focusing on how to utilize the reservoirs in the best possible manner. Likewise, we are pioneering EOR technologies in the Bab field to maximize oil recovery in an efficient way. We play a role in supporting ADNOC on the long- term development of the sub-surface and surface dynamics. BP has deployed subject matter experts to work alongside ADNOC in its HQ, many of these secondees aid in technological development, particularly in the areas of big data analytics and AI. We also work with ADNOC to study ways to access the substantial gas resources tied up in gas caps. ADNOC has embarked on a new journey that is driven by the UAE's leadership, and the whole industry is shifting from an upstream-driven approach to a full-value approach. A significant strand of this strategy involves finding the right markets and providing the correct products for those markets. We are also looking at how we can become more efficient not only in producing extra barrels but also identifying which are the most cost-effective, all the while supporting ADNOC to deliver a safe and reliable operation.<br><br><strong>Can international oil companies hope to be taken seriously as significant players in the energy transition?<br></strong>At BP, we try to respond to the market and to consumer demand, which presents a dual challenge: the growth of energy demands against climate change. This is why BP is applying technology to improve our efficiency and reduce CO2 and other emissions from our operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-future-is-now]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We hear a great deal about the future of marketing and what that will eventually mean for every marketer in industries around the globe. For starters, we cannot talk about the future without focusing on technology. Second, we are actually already full speed ahead in this future. The speed at which marketing has ascended requires high-speed tools to understand how current—and potential—customers behave and how various contexts impact decision making and purchasing. As thought leaders, our goal is to improve our clients' marketing strategies and extend their customer outreach while optimizing their marketing spent.</p><p>Fortunately, technology today allows us to do just that. Marketing technology, or martech, is the intersection of marketing and technology that are frequently being used to better understand consumers and quickly achieve marketing objectives. Marketing companies have to either adopt these technologies right now or risk becoming gradually obsolete.<br>Some of the biggest brands in the world like Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, J.P. Morgan, and Nestlé have been utilizing martech to optimize their growth and relevance as trends disrupt their respective industries. I believe we have only scratched the surface of what is possible, as deeper and more sophisticated integration of marketing and technology begin to appear. Globally, the martech industry is valued at approximately USD121.5 billion, representing a YoY increase of 22% (BDO Insights, 2019). This industry currently has over 7,000 vendors offering solutions in big data and gathering immediate feedback, augmented and virtual reality, media intelligence and distribution, software (SAAS), personalization, and much more.<br>In fact, in 2019, one of the UK's government communication services held its “Year of Marketing," which entailed upskilling marketers and providing the necessary insights and tools to raise communication standards and lead in terms of digital marketing.</p><p>At Multiply, we are consistently reinventing ourselves to keep up with the ever-growing marketplace. Our ethos is not to fight this change, but rather to adapt and integrate it along with our existing platform of services. For example, understanding how current—and potential— customers behave through neuromarketing and research, and how the various contexts impact decision making and purchasing, has been paramount to enhancing our clients' marketing strategies and creating better creative campaigns and impactful messaging.</p><p>Using specific media monitoring tools and neuromarketing devices (eye-tracking, facial recognition, EEG, biometric recordings, and implicit testing) allows us to optimize our clients' returns, customer engagement, and data analysis.</p><p>Not only does martech allow us to design campaigns backed by science and data, but it is also transforming marketing into a more cost-efficient function overall. This is why understanding, acquiring, and partnering with martech vendors have been a massive part of our strategy over the last three years, and I expect this to increasingly become a core part of our business plan in the coming years.</p><p>At Cityscape Abu Dhabi 2019, we were mandated by one of our clients, a leading Abu Dhabi-based developer, to maximize the sale of its plots of land to investors. To that end, we recreated the architectural drawings and perspectives of the future development using augmented reality to allow potential investors and passersby to experience the apartment, building, or any other part of the plot we were displaying. The client's perspectives were brought to life and transformed into a virtual yet “real-life" development. The alternative would have been a much less interactively placed brochure stacking all the information within the leaflets.</p><p>Globally, CMOs have started to catch on to this mega trend. Just in 2019, Forbes reported that 2020 would witness over 80% of B2B marketers invest- ing in software and tech tools to plan, execute, and measure returns on marketing campaigns. This is following the trend set by major global corporations. For example, IBM announced earlier in 2020 that it would be launching its Advertising Accelerator for advertisers to benefit from. It is an AI-based platform that empowers advertisers to predict what their consumer wants to see and tar- gets ads appropriately.</p><p>According to IBM, this al- lows media buyers to deliver “1:1 advertising that not only continuously learns but also predicts the optimal combination of visual elements to drive the highest engagement for a given audience." Since 2016, Starbucks has been using AI and real-time data to send over 400,000 variants of hyper-personalized messages to its loyal customer base of over 13 million users (Forbes, 2018).</p><p>Its application also employs its AI-based algorithms to push individualized suggestions and recommendations. Wouldn't you like to be reminded it is almost time for your next caffeine fix? This is happening to products and services of all sizes.</p><p>L'Oreal's Perso has integrated sensors, a microphone, and Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections in its smart hairbrush that will provide users with the best way to care for their hair (L'Oreal, 2020). Another important component of martech is voice control. Voice control will be taking the lead as the mobile advertising industry will revolve around voice recommendations and conversations. When you pair this with the potential of 5G, the opportunities for automotive marketing are endless.</p><p>Mckinsey (2019) discussed the possibility of merging all of these concepts to allow brands such as FMCG companies to advertise directly to your profile as you drive by a specific location. My team and I attended CES2020, the annual consumer electronics show, in January and were able to get a close-up and hands-on experience of much of this technology. One of the highlights was the airport displays of “parallel reality" introduced by Delta Airlines.</p><p>These screens can show different messages to different people at the same time. The potential applications for this technology and its impact on outdoor advertising and entertainment industries are enormous, and I cannot wait to start witnessing them in Abu Dhabi. Technology in marketing enables your target demographic (consumer, patient, business, brand, and so on) to experience and engage with your brand in very personalized ways.</p><p>Therefore, it is our job to acquire, understand, and optimize these technologies for our clients, allowing for the creation of rich, emotional, and efficient experiences for their consumers. As it currently stands, the state of martech is primarily focused on the commoditization of individual services instead of the offering of a one-stop-shop of solutions. An average of 28 different technologies across the board seems to be a reliable indication that a more streamlined solution is needed. Many players in the industry have identified this issue and are working toward building a true full suite of solutions.</p><p>That is the future of martech—an offering of a more streamlined, integrated, and all-encompassing solution. The UAE has always been a leader in most trends. I am certain both Abu Dhabi and Dubai will continue to lead the region in adopting the coolest and most efficient technologies to create the best value for global brands and ensure the greatest convenience for its citizens and consumers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you provide an overview of Dragon Oil and its core priorities?<br></strong>Dragon Oil is an international oil and gas exploration, development, and production company. Our main business task is to ensure that we have cash positive bottom-line results. As such, we aim to strike a balance between high-performance activities and profitability. Changing management has to be positive for Dragon Oil, especially in an industry such as oil and gas, which is continuously transforming. Dragon Oil has a collaborative approach; we like to problem solve and create value through synergy and integration. We have significant operations in Turkmenistan with our principal producing asset at Cheleken in the eastern section of the Caspian Sea. This was our first overseas base, established 20 years ago. We are the 100% owner and operator of the concession jointly in the Cheleken oilfield with the government of Turkmenistan. Currently, we produce 70,000bpd, though the highest we have achieved is 100,000bpd. We are currently redeveloping the field to return to this volume. Due to our performance in Turkmenistan, we have established an excellent reputation in the industry. We bring substantial technical competence to our operations. With an international workforce, we have diversity in thinking and output. Wherever we operate, we always consider ourselves as strategic partners of the government and country.<br><br><strong>What are some of Dragon Oil's other significant overseas operations?<br></strong>In Iraq, we hold 30% equity of the Faihaa-1 field, a massive field operated by the United Energy Group. We have plans to increase production from 22,000bpd to 50,000bpd by the end of 2020. In Egypt, we recently entered the Gulf of Suez, a stake we took over from BP. In 2019, we completed the acquisition of its existing operations and at present operate 11 concessions that are all mature. Overall, this has strengthened our profile as an organization. It has demonstrated that we are highly capable of operations of this magnitude. Currently, production is at around 60,000bpd, which we aim to increase to about 75,000bpd. Across Dragon Oil, our rate of production is close to 150,000bpd. As we look ahead, our overall strategy is to produce 300,000bpd by 2026. In addition, we are exploring gas monetization in Turkmenistan, which would significantly expand our operations. Recently, we had discussions about several concession blocks. In general, we are an ambitious company. We look to achieve speed, efficiency, and agility in terms of our operations and pricing.</p><p><strong>In what ways have you built local expertise and helped in the development of the countries that you operate?<br></strong>Our priority is to develop a competent workforce throughout our global operations. We have rigorous training programs that prepare our workforce for the reality of the environments where they will work. This preparation aims to build operational competence. We also aim to impart leadership qualities such as effective decision making. On the frontline of our operations, it is also crucial that we instill a culture of compliance with international rules and regulations. In the countries where we operate, we have an excellent track record of building local human resources. We are a technology-centric organization whose innovations create a platform for upskilling the next generation of oil and gas professionals. What is more, Dragon Oil has several CSR activities that enrich society, mainly in education, where we invest in equipment for sports and music.<span></span></p><p><strong>What technologies are you exploring?<br></strong>The complexity of some of our operating environments means that innovative technologies have excellent use cases. We have already applied AI to the Cheleken field, which, owing to the structural dynamics of some of these floating assets, we have seen several notable benefits. Much of the data gathered helps us to uncover efficiencies. Machine learning allows us to increase the accuracy of prediction through AI. This is a dual-pronged approach, and as we depend on machine learning, we grow in parallel with this technology. I predict newer technologies such as smart field applications for automation to disrupt the sector even further, as they become more advanced, especially when we deploy methods of transferring data in real-time both for drilling, production, and maintenance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>As ADNOC seeks to remain competitive in the evolving energy landscape, how has this focus shaped ADNOC's growth strategy? More broadly speaking, what does a national oil company need to do to prepare for success in the future?<br></strong>Our industry is being disrupted on multiple levels—by new technology, new business and operating models, new forms of energy, and a new geopolitical order. Yet, the oil and gas company of today can be a winner of tomorrow, if it operates at a lower level of cost and a higher level of performance, brings digital into the core of its operations, embeds sustainability into its DNA, and rethinks how to leverage its partnerships, enable its people, and re-center its customer relationships. As an essential driver of economic development, we are in the business of progress around the world. By doubling down on this mission to modernize, we can and will remain an essential pillar of the future diversified energy mix. At ADNOC, we understand the necessity to think and act differently. We have adopted a more flexible and open mindset when it comes to deciding how to grow each of our businesses for long-term success. We have also broadened our universe of stakeholders and partners to ensure we are working with third parties that can provide the best, strategic and operational fit for our assets and businesses. This includes engaging with new sets of investors who value long-term sustainable returns, as well as creating relationships where best practices are shared, technology is leveraged, capital efficiency is maximized, and market access is enhanced. By doing so, we are seizing the opportunities of the fourth industrial age and, in effect, nurturing the national oil company of the future.</p><p><strong>ADNOC receives a lot of interest from prospective international partners. What are the most important qualities, beyond bottom line considerations, that the company is looking for in potential collaborations? What does it take to secure a partnership with ADNOC?<br></strong>For decades, ADNOC and the UAE have adopted a partnership approach to their energy businesses. It is one of ADNOC and the UAE's defining strengths, and it has helped enhance ADNOC's global reputation as a trusted and reliable business partner and supplier of energy. Moreover, it reflects the spirit of partnership that defines the ethos of the UAE itself, and we wish to leverage that to ensure we maximize value from our assets and resources. So, we look for valuable partners that are forward thinking and fast acting, share our values, and are willing to contribute both capital and technological expertise for the joint pursuit of growth opportunities and financial returns. The ideal partner brings tangible strategic value to ADNOC, including access to new markets, and a willingness to invest alongside us and across our entire value chain.</p><p><strong>What is the significance to the UAE of the Murban Futures Contract and the launch of the ICE Futures Abu Dhabi Exchange, and how does this fit into the broader ADNOC strategy?</strong><br>Our Murban crude is a high-quality, highly sought-after grade unique to the UAE that our customers around the world know, value, and rely on. The decision by the Supreme Petroleum Council to list Murban as a futures contract and the launch of a new exchange in Abu Dhabi by Intercontinental Exchange mark an historic change in the way Murban crude will be priced and traded. For the first time, Murban will be priced on a forward-looking, market-driven basis, offering the market greater transparency and certainty. In turn, this will help capture more value from every barrel we produce, and it places Abu Dhabi and the UAE at the geographic center of global crude trading.<br><br><strong>The UAE government has identified advancement in the areas of AI, automation and digitization as critical to the future development and diversification of the economy. How is ADNOC supporting these broad strategic goals, and what role do AI, automation and digitization play in ADNOC's transformation? </strong><br>ADNOC fully supports the UAE leadership's vision to ensure the country remains at the cutting edge of advanced technology. At ADNOC, we are deploying state-of-the-art digital technologies, such as AI, predictive maintenance, drone technology and robotics, not only as key enablers of our growth but also as tools to improve performance and to generate greater value. As a result, we are embracing new ways of thinking about our business and leveraging the power of greater connectivity to strengthen our operational foundations. Every day, we analyze terabytes of information in our Panorama Digital Command Centre to support real-time decision making and enhance our ability to adapt quickly and effectively to changes in market dynamics. By combining new digital technologies with data-driven insights, we are redefining the boundaries of our operations and harnessing digital's true potential to deliver greater efficiencies, enhance performance, improve health, safety and environmental protection and to create long-term sustainable value.</p><p><strong>The opening of ADNOC's Digital Command Centre sends a powerful message about the adoption of advanced technology at the heart of the company's operations. What do you see as the technological developments that will prove most ground-breaking over the next decade?</strong><br>I cannot predict which new technologies will emerge in the future, but ADNOC is committed to unlocking the power of advanced technologies across all our operations. Digitalization is taking place along our full value chain, including analyzing potential exploration sites, drilling and extraction, pipeline construction, project operation and maintenance, and standardizing organizational procedures. We are utilizing digital technologies to not only empower our people to make better and quicker mar- ket-driven decisions, but also to unlock new hydrocarbon resources, increase efficiencies, optimize costs, and enhance performance. Looking to the future, we will continue to deploy new technologies that enable us to maximize value from every molecule we produce for the benefit of our shareholder, partners, and people and to stay ahead of the expand- ing energy demand curve.<br><br><strong>One of the most critical subjects in the energy transition is responsible production. How does ADNOC approach this issue across its operations?</strong><br>If future demand for energy is to be met, it will require an ecosystem that supports all forms of energy, from oil and gas to renewables and nuclear. It is also equally clear the world will need more energy with fewer emissions and we are ready to meet that challenge. Guided by the vision of our founding father, the late Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, responsible production has been at the heart of ADNOC's approach to energy exploration from the very beginning. We produce some of the least carbon intensive barrels in the world; building on this legacy, we recently announced a comprehensive set of sustainability goals for 2030. By 2030, we will reduce our green-house gas intensity by an additional 25%. We will limit our fresh water consumption to below 0.5% of our total water use. We will increase our carbon capture utilization and storage program by 500% to capture the same amount of CO2 as 5 million acres of forest and we will plant 10 million mangroves in Abu Dhabi's Al Dhafra Region, preventing coastline erosion and protecting bio- diversity offshore and on land. Our methane intensity is already among the lowest in the industry and we are investing in advanced and innovative technology that not only captures significant amounts of carbon dioxide from industrial sources but also frees up much needed clean burning gas for other purposes. We are also pioneering the use of optical drones to monitor fugitive emissions and exploring the use of advanced algorithms, predictive analytics, big data and AI to enhance our environmental performance and management practices. But responsible production extends beyond emissions control. It also requires we prioritize the health and safety of employees and the public and do our utmost to protect the environment we operate in. Here too, our record is among the best in the industry. HSE is in our DNA and in these critical areas there can and will be no compromises as we continue to meet the world's growing demand for energy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>CVK Mining is the largest exporter of chromite products in Turkey, but is undergoing a large investment campaign in other mining sectors, specifically lead and zinc. What are CVK's investment plans on this area? </h4><p>Starting in 2017, we made a strategic decision to diversify our revenue—at the time 85% of CVK's revenue was from chromite products. Though we were and still are the biggest exporter of chromite products in Turkey, we have plans in place to decrease chromite's share of our revenue to 50% by 2022. To put this plan into action, we assessed our existing non-chromite concessions and acquired some more in 2017 to start developing them. At our existing Çanakkale Kalkım operations we reached up to 25.000 tons per month ore production and 2.000 tons per month lead and zinc concentrate processing per month capacity at our in-situ floatation plant. At this region we have four operating and two exploration licenses for lead and zinc which means that it will be explored further in the near future. At our newly developed İzmir Bayındır operations which we entered by acquiring a company that was sitting on six licenses, we reached up to 20.000 metric tons per month run-of-mine production capacity only after being granted all necessary permits and start digging on January 2019.</p><h4>How did CVK invest and develop its operations in İzmir after the acquisition?</h4><p>Before the ink was dry from that acquisition contract, we started applying for all the necessary mining, forestry and environmental permits. As soon as we got those permits, we drilled over 20,000 meters of full core diamond boreholes and quickly analyzed the results, which showed we had a proven reserve of over 2 million tons averaging 8% lead and zinc combined at this basin. With this number in hand, we started to budget the real investments, and started the mining operation in Izmir in 2019. It is fully mechanized and uses brand new machinery—we have spent over EUR20 million on this operation, including for new machinery and a pre-sorting and enrichment plant underground, the first in Turkey. The run-of-min production from underground is 4% to 5% lead and zinc combined; when we scrape the gang minerals (unwanted material) underground before taking it out, this number goes up to 8-10%. This helps a lot considering the transportation costs since because we truck these ore to the flotation plant at our Çannakkale Kalkım operation to be processed for the time being. We are still waiting the for the environmental impact assessment (EIA) permit to be granted for the new Izmir Bayındır Floatation Processing Plant that we already budgeted and planned as our next big investment at the region. Our aim is to go up to 240,000 tons per annum averaging a minimum of 10% grade lead and zinc combined. By 2020's end, we will hit that target. Right now the Çanakkale plant is being fed 25,000 tons of ore monthly and is producing a minimum of 2,000 tons of concentrate product that we export. In the meantime, as exploration never ends for a mining company; we have 12 surface drilling rigs currently in operation all around the country that continue to drill, explore, and analyze.</p><h4>CVK is also investing in gold and silver. What is your investment strategy in this area?</h4><p>We already have a resource that proven with international codes complied mineral resource estimation report which gives us the confidence to go in there and invest. The proven number of indicated resources are already larger than some operating mines in Turkey, and we still have an extensive room to grow thus keep exploring. We acquired the Balıkesir Sarıalan Gold - Silver License Area in 2009, and we started surface geology exploration studies with mapping, remote sensing technology, and geophysics in 2011. In 2014, we deployed two drilling rigs and are now up to six. In the last 4.5 years, we have drilled over 34,000meters of full core drilling on a 200 ha focus area during which we have kept intersecting great ore seems . We started applying all permitting process which we hope to end by mid 2020. We have budgeted circa USD120-million capex investment only in the first 2 years of the project and the life-of-mine will be 20 years. In 2019, as Turkish Gold Mining Industry, we hit record production of 42 tons of gold metal, and our project alone will pull a minimum of 8 tons per year, so we are going to scale up the entire country's capacity quite significantly which we are already proud of.</p><h4>CVK has been notable for its use of technology in its mining operations. Can you give an overview of your strategy for technology and automation?</h4><p>When it comes to optimizing your mining technique, comprehending the geometry of ore body to best of your knowledge is the most critical aspect of operation. Chromite mines in Turkey are discontinuous, faulted and tilted narrow vein type bodies of ore which is extra limiting when it comes to applying technology during actual mining. Thus technology available in the market is not directly applicable. Instead of waiting on the market to develop mechanization and automation solutions for this particular ore type, we, mining professionals at CVK, sat around the table with machinery gurus of Turkey, explained our needs and bottlenecks particularly on run-of-mine ore haulage. This council of experts developed prototypes according to our requirements and eventually one particular load, haul, and dump machine design came to life with only 80cm length and 50cm width, remote controlled and lithium battery powered rather than conventional diesel or electric. We now have 18 of them in operation, and ramped up our production by 25% in tonnage. Before, mine workers were going in with small diesel-powered locomotives, shoveling ore into wagons, and pulling them up by hand. Now it's fully done by these agents adding a tremendous value to our operations not only cost-efficiency wise but also elevated health and safety standards. now it is done by the machinery. Another process of mining that we recently utilized modern automation technology is the extraction of ore products from underground shafts. Traditional hoisting cranes we used to have at UG shafts were all manually  operated by mine workers causing a risk of health and safety concerns while creating a critical bottleneck at production capacity usage. In the last four years we spent EUR5 million on this special infrastructure upgrade project and installed state-of-art fully automated shaft hoisting systems. Thanks to this new safe and high-paced fully automated technology, production capacity of our shafts increased two-folds. Again the privilege of eliminating worker-induced incident risk at this process give us nothing but proud on our work. As CVK, even though we have the best opex figures in Turkey, we always keep looking for new ways to introduce technology to our operations.</p><h4>What are the primary objectives for CVK in the mining sector for 2020?</h4><p>In general for the first half, we will wait and see because of the low commodity prices; however, we never stop when it comes to chromite; we keep increasing our production capacity. In 2019, we produced 17,000 tons of chromite ore products per month on average; in 2020, we will easily do 25,000 per month. By 2023, we are aiming to hit 50,000 tons/month hopefully through new investments budgeted especially in the Bursa region. Lead and zinc treatment costs are at historical levels, and it would be a shame to sell it at this level. Hence, we will wait for the markets to get back on track. For gold, if we are granted our Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by mid-2020, we will start digging immediately with the aim to pour our first gold by the beginning of 2021. Another mid-term project of our group is on magnesite. Geologically it's found with chromite, so our engineers are studying ways to more efficiently mine our magnesite reserves out. If we can find an economically feasible way to extract and blend different qualities of magnesite ores in order to have a sustainable feed material that justifies further investment, then, with a relatively small investment, we are going to build a calcination plant in the Bursa region which will give us the right amount of calcinated magnesite ore that has sizable share particularly on Western metallurgy markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were some of the biggest achievements of the company in 2019?</h4><p>The biggest achievement was finally launching cars that are made in Mexico; after a thorough analysis we decided to go all in, and we are proud of it. The A Class Sedan and the GLB are fully built and assembled in Aguascalientes. So far, the new line has been well received by our customers. Our plan is to not just serve the Mexican market but also export to other markets. In particular, we are proud of the plant for the GLB line because it's the only such plant in the world. We have received great response from the local market.</p><h4>How would you compare the performance of the company in 2019 in comparison to 2018? </h4><p>In 2018, we were number one in the luxury segment while 2019 was a challenging year because we saw a drop in sales. The entire market experienced a drop, which affected our sales as well. Although our performance was not significantly lower, we started to see a shift in the trend, which often gives rise to a number of challenges. One of the reasons behind the drop in sales was the general economic environment in Mexico. There were some other reasons as well. For example, we stopped selling the smart brand in 2019. The overall business environment allowed us to focus on the service side, which is still the main relationship point for us and the customers. We launched a program called Amaze the Customer, under which we are rethinking the way we do things. It is important to question yourself because the world is constantly changing, and so are consumer habits and expectations. Changing an organization's culture is exciting, but it is also challenging because it a long process. It is one of our main goals for 2020 and beyond, and we are working on it.</p><h4>What are your expectations for sales in 2020?</h4><p>We are bringing in new products, such as the new E Class, most of our SUV´s model range will have a new generation like the: GLS, GLE and GLE Coupe and GLA, also on our AMG line will have some surprises, like the Mercedes-AMG A 35. We will continue improving our offering, introducing new products, and implanting new technology. Toward the end of 2020, we will introduce Mercedes-Benz' first full electric car, and we are extremely excited about that, the new EQC definitely will show the path into the future, this will require us to plan differently with our dealers in terms of spare parts and expertise. It will be challenging because it is a new segment for us, but at the same time, it is a segment with an exciting and promising future.</p><h4>Is there a lot of demand in the Mexican market for electric cars?</h4><p>There is a lot of eagerness because the public wants to protect the environment. At present, it is not the cheapest technology, so we have to work our way around to match the expectations. We do not have an exact date yet but the car will be released by the end of 2020. Notably, those interested in it can get more information about it because it is already being sold in Europe and North America.</p><h4>What added value will the Mercedes EQ brand offer?</h4><p>From the start, we worked maximizing every aspect of the Mercedes EQ, with the EQC model such as performance, luxury, quality, service, and design. Customers often complain about the odd look-and-feel of electric cars, but the EQC will boast a unique design that will respect the values of the brand.</p><h4>What strategies is Mercedes-Benz employing to attract the youth?</h4><p>It is a challenge because the needs and demand of the youth are changing rapidly. A few years ago, we introduced a new strategy with the new generation product line, the new Generation  Compact Car segment as we call it . The refreshed line-up of these compacts with the A Class Sedan and the GLB are excellent examples of how to meet the needs of young people. The new GLB offers flexibility, which is something that is in high demand. Equally important, we are also offering a whole new platform with more apps and better connectivity so that young people can use the car as a fun gadget.</p><h4>Are millennials one of your target segments in Mexico?</h4><p>Yes, definitely. Our cars have all the features that millennials are looking for: Mercedes me or MBUX are just two examples. We are also in touch with this segment so that we can better satisfy the client's needs.</p><h4>How has the company advanced toward its goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2039?</h4><p>We have an ambitious target to be carbon neutral by 2039. This will require a lot of work, which explains our focus on changing the organizational culture. It is a corporate-wide initiative and that means, as a global company, we are going through an important transformation. We are proud to be part of that and everything we do, will be geared toward meeting that target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Mexico play within SURA Asset Management's international business strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>Grupo SURA has three main divisions: Asset management, Insurance and Banking. SURA Asset Management is the leading Pension Fund in Latin America with more than 18 million clients.   Mexico plays an extremely important role in terms of results, revenues, sales and number of clients. It represents around 35% of the region´s total revenues for this business line and contributes approximately 8 million clients.  In our growth strategy, Mexico represents a huge opportunity; not is it the largest country where SURA AM is present, its predominantly young population and growth space for increasing our market share (currently at 15%) makes it a very attractive market.  We definitely have space to grow in Mexico. The pension system in Mexico was designed in the late 1990s, so we are slightly behind in the process of accumulating assets. Therefore, we are growing assets at a faster pace than in other countries.</p><h4>SURA Asset Management is ranked fourth in pension funds in Mexico, but first in Latin America. What strategies is the group using to become number one in Mexico?</h4><p>Afore SURA stands out from its competitors for its strong and solid investment professionals with a well- established investment process and long- term perspective. Afore SURA is the only pension fund to obtain a Morningstar Silver Analyst ranking for two consecutive years, the highest ranking Morningstar assigned during that period.  Most of our competitors are part of major banks, insurance companies, and other financial institutions; there are few players with a core business in pension management, and Afore SURA is one of them. That differentiates us.</p><h4>What is the value of being a non-bank pension fund manager?</h4><p>We are professionals in this specific field; we are asset managers by nature and know this area well. For banks and some insurance companies, this segment is just an additional non-core business. For retailers, it is certainly non-core, it is just a complementary part of their main business. Asset management, however, is our core business. We have the methodology,  philosophy, and experienced investment teams with a long term perspective, focused on helping our clients build their pension fund for a pleasant retirement.</p><h4>What were SURA Asset Management Mexico's biggest achievements of 2019?</h4><p>During 2019, the market performed extremely well both globally and in Mexico. In the pension funds business, we are concentrated in fixed-income assets as the local investment regulations stipulate. Interest rates in Mexico have decreased by close to 200 base points, which gave us a solid boost and performance. The whole system performed extremely well in 2019, with an average return of 15%. We surpassed that average by 100 base points. That is a great accomplishment and reflects the fact that we are asset managers and pay close attention to performing better than our competitors on a regular basis. The other achievement we are particularly proud of was that 2019 marked the fourth year that Afore SURA ranked as the #1 pension provider in Service, based on a survey by Consar, the Mexican regulator. Other important milestones include the creation of a more digital and agile culture, a dedicated team to assess ESG investments, and the affiliation of Afore SURA to the Principles for Responsible Investment initiative.</p><h4>In what ways is SURA Asset Management Mexico trying to be one step ahead of others in terms of digitalization?</h4><p>One of our top priorities is to be ahead in developing the best digital solutions that enable us to be nearer our clients to solve their needs in a more agile and convenient ways for them.  We have significantly  improved our clients experience by reducing the time clients had to spend using our services by 50%.  </p><h4>What strategies are you using to improve consumers' financial education in Mexico?</h4><p>We see our main value offering as providing advice to our customers and supporting them in their financial decisions. We want to educate our clients regarding the importance of saving for their retirement, and there are many things they can do to improve their retirement fund. We use analytical tools and studies to look at how much and how often our clients save, and based on this information we provide them with better solutions and a more personalized advice. The level of informality is high in Mexico's labor market, employees actively contribute to their pension system less than 40% of the time during their entire careers. This is an extremely important issue, because the result is an important gap in their replacement rate. In SURA Asset Management we are aware of this situation and have significant efforts to extend our voluntary savings vehicles through digital platforms. Our growth rate for voluntary savings for the last five years has been around 42%, more than double the market average. We are highly committed to promoting such services to our client base to help them reach the retirement they desire.</p><h4>What are your main goals and expectations for 2020?</h4><p>SURA Asset Management Mexico has two business lines in Mexico: pensions and wealth management. In pensions, we will continue to improve our services and invest heavily in selling digitally and in financial education. We are fully committed with our clients to deliver the best returns possible in the market. In our wealth management business, we are still a small player in Mexico for individuals' wealth management but have great expectations to grow aggressively in this business. Our institutional investment management business is an important player in managing private pension funds and insurance companies reserves. We want to grow heavily in the personal wealth management segment, so we are developing a whole new business line. We are improving our product offering in terms of the quantity of products, open architecture, and more sophisticated products for the Mexican market. We have high expectations about penetrating this segment of the wealth management market. We currently have 0.42% of total market share in this segment and are projecting to grow this to 4-5% within five years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies are you using to overcome Mexico's low insurance penetration rate?</h4><p>Mexico has 2.2% insurance penetration. This is a percentage that has been the same for many decades. When I started my career in insurance the percentage was only 1.8%. The insurance sector has not grown much in the last 15 years. The government should be investing in education and financial inclusion to change this reality. Everyone has a cell phone now, which means it is now easier than ever to access people. Currently, our penetration rate in the states where we are present is a consequence of our salesforce reaching the most isolated communities.</p><h4>What are the companies' main strategic objectives when it comes to growth in the insurance sector?</h4><p>We have three strategic objectives. The first is to diversify, which we are doing in terms of products, branches, and other forms of collections. The second is to protect and consolidate our business. Today, we have more than 300,000 clients in individual life insurance and a portfolio of MXN2.4 billion. We want keep customers closer through technology, physical presence, and so on. What we have seen and learned in these years is that clients stay because of the relationship they formed with us. They also stay for the product and good service, though a long-term relationship comes from considerate treatment of clients. The third objective is to grow the business. Grupo KC is beginning to diversify out of the field of insurance. On the financial side, we are taking advantage of our economy of scale through other businesses such as multi-purpose financial corporations (SOFOM). We are also implementing loans for payroll discounts to people who sometimes need them. We are competing not only in terms of the service but also with decent rates. Part of the population needs more support, and we help provide that support.</p><h4>How is the portfolio balanced between public and private?</h4><p>Around 2010, the portfolio was all payroll discounts. Today, our portfolio is 70% public and 30% private. We have grown at rates of around 14% annually. We have not actually diminished the business line of the government, but we have grown a lot in the private sector. We are looking to establish a more balanced portfolio. Before, it was easier to implement a payroll discount agreement with the government; now those agreements are closing, and they do not allow you to use the government's payroll to sell products. We have to acquire clients through debit cards that are used to receive payrolls.</p><h4>How did you win the Latin American Quality award for best Mexican company?</h4><p>We are a socially responsible company, and all our activities are aligned with the UN's SDG objectives. The recognition, in part, has to do with our business approach. This organization evaluates at international level, by sectors, which is where and how they evaluate us. We have several certifications, such as IPSO 9000, including from Microsoft. Both at the Mexican insurance level and at the international insurance level, we have been recognized as one of the fifty best agencies in the world for sales, quality, and customer conservation. We also received several awards in 2019, including one from Business Global, who recently talked to us about another European award for quality.</p><h4>How many offices do you plan to add by the end of 2020?</h4><p>We now have 50 offices in five states: Mexico City, Nuevo León, Guerrero, Oaxaca, and the State of Mexico. These offices are strategically located so that our clients do not have to go far distances. We have 17 offices spread across the seven regions to serve the most remote clients. The next step is to open offices in Puebla, Guanajuato, and Querétaro. In fact, the Bají­o region will be the main goal for 2020, because of our success in Monterrey has allowed us to start covering the region. We are strong in the southern part with Guerrero and Oaxaca, so I want to focus on the center and then go south.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[<p>Christopher Carlos Gill was born in 1979 in Bournemouth, England. At a very young age he moved overseas, becoming an expat living and working on three different continents. He graduated in 1997 in International Business and Hotel Administration. He was then hired by a vacation club where he covered various positions. In 2002, during the boom years of the Costa del Sol in Spain, he opened his own real estate company, “Orangestate,“ advising many foreign clients, step by step, how to make their dream home or investment come true. In 2005, he went back to the hotel industry, working for a major resort group in Mexico, before moving to their real estate division in 2009. Today, he is working with SIMCA, a group that has been active for more than 15 years in the real estate market in Mexico, including the Riviera Maya. SIMCA has successfully delivered more than 27 projects, offering premium homes and luxury condos in markets such as Playa del Carmen. One of their Playa projects has won awards for its innovative design. Full property and rental management services are available to SIMCA owners, allowing them to generate income while staying hands off. SIMCA is also behind the Siempre project, which is in the heart of an up-and-coming zone in downtown Playa, and set to become the city's most chic address.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what ways has the real estate market in the south east of the country surpassed the company's expectations?</h4><p>The market has performed beyond our original expectations. We have been in Southeast Mexico for a long time now. Simca Development has been developing for more than 15 years, even before the boom in this beautiful region, which comprises the major cities of Cancún, Playa del Carmen, Tulum and Merida. Today, this business represents the fourth-largest real estate destination in the world. We have been honored and fortunate to be part of it. We can segment the real estate industry into various sections. Second homes are one of the biggest, most important reasons why real estate here boomed so much. Many foreigners are finding Riviera Maya, southeast Mexico, and Mérida a destination for second homes. We have many clients from Canada and the US. There are also many retirees from the US, Canada, and even different parts of Mexico choosing the southeast as a safe, sound, and beautiful retirement destination. This is another major feature that is a highlight of the real estate industry in southeast Mexico. The third segment is investment. If we focus primarily on Playa del Carmen and Tulum, people are finding in us what is called a “two-step investment“ mostly aimed at great capital gains. People are jumping in at an early stage or pre-construction, obtaining the lowest price in history.</p><h4>What are your plans in regards to national expansion?</h4><p>We do think about investing in real estate, especially after seeing the way the stock market is behaving when from one day to another, the stock market has fallen significantly. People are looking at real estate as one of the safest bets for their investment today. In fact, it will be a fairly stable market that still gives dual investment purpose: capital gains plus rental income.  We cater to different products like second homes, permanent residences, and luxury residences as well, which is aimed at personal use rather than an investment.</p><h4>In regards to the national expansion beyond the Southeast of Mexico, what is your timeline for the expansion?</h4><p>The national expansion could be happening in the next 12-month cycle. Some 18 years of experience and, most importantly, the know-how of understanding the market and its current changes have given us confidence. We are a fairly young corporation and are extremely passionate about what we do and what we have delivered in the past. We have delivered 30 projects so far around southeast Mexico. More than 2,800 families are already enjoying their permanent homes, second homes, investment properties, or luxury residences with us. We have doubled the numbers of the last 15 years in the last year alone. We clearly know Mexico's trajectory. Mexico has a great deal to offer, and now that we have confirmed we have the know-how and have clearly segmented the market with our products, we can now jump to the next step and start expanding in Mexico and the international market in the future.</p><h4>Do you plan to open any new business segments this year?</h4><p>Part of our corporation owns hotel chains. Through our sister company Happy Address, we are involved in travel agencies and management companies, and we are involved in other businesses at a much lower level; however, I primarily assist the companies today. We work back to back to provide a unique real estate product. We own the building company for example. We own part of the companies that provide the material. We own the commercial part, the management, and rental company. We are a company that you can trust. We have a great track record and a high-quality real estate product in a turn-key model. Buyers are talking to the same person from start to finish, which inspires great trust.</p><h4>What projects are you developing at the moment?</h4><p>Right now, in Mérida, we have beautiful gated communities that are still available. Right now, my top recommendation would be Provincia, which starts at USD50,000. It is a beautiful piece of land to build one's home in a fantastic gated community. It is full of amenities: restaurants, clubhouses, and tennis and golf courses. If one is looking more for capital gains, mid-term investments in Merida, Blanca definitely speaks for itself. Merida is the safest city in America after Quebec, which is a big thing because when people think about Mexico, they sometimes worry about safety. In the Riviera Maya, we are starting a beautiful luxury project in Cancún with 20 stories and a private marina at the end of the year. That is a great opportunity for people seeking top luxury. Playa del Carmen and Tulum have different properties going on for luxury real estate like Miranda, Cruz con Mar, and Sabor a Miel to low-budget investment properties like in Ipana. In addition, we have Singular Hotels, which has been outperforming incredibly since we opened it. For Tulum, we delivered many projects in the past. Querido Tulum has been globally recognized in different architectural magazines and architects. However, it is a project in the over USD200,000 category. We also have low-budget investment properties such Costa Caribe, which start at USD145,400 for one-bedroom. Last, but not least, the biggest business year of Tulum is coming up in 2020. We are part of the first gated community with beachfront in downtown Tulum. Properties will be as low as USD209,000 for a two-bedroom with our famous lock-off system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4></h4><h4>What is the historic perspective of the Universidad Santo Tomás?</h4><p>Universidad Santo Tomás was the first university in Colombia, founded in 1580. We are over 440 years old, while the second oldest is around 360. We are in a historic reality that includes present and future realities. The order that manages the university is the Dominicans friars. The university has nearly 30,000 students and employs more than 4,000 people between academics and administrative staff. We could say that it is a big company that supports the country's growth.</p><h4> <br>What has been your contribution to Colombia?</h4><p>There have been a few important moments in our history. We were the first university in Colombia that took a step to ensure there was an educational institution during the colonial era. For example, the first “Muisca" grammar was written by Dominicans. That connection between the indigenous worlds and Spain took place through knowledge. Academia was important to protect the human rights of the indigenous. Then, during the independence period, we Dominicans were heavily involved; the priest of Bolí­var, as a matter of fact, was a Dominican. The third moment was when the industrial revolution took place, because the university in the 20th century emerged as one of the most important educational institutions in the country. Some presidents, ministers, and many judges graduated from Universidad Santo Tomás. This university has been part of the country's main historic moments, though we are going through the digitalization processes that the world is experiencing.</p><h4> <br>How does the Christian philosophy play a part in the educational spirit of the university?</h4><p>The Christian humanism is a paramount factor to education. We support humanism, particularly Christian, which has an essential trace. For us, the philosophical learning is important. We have organized for more than 40 years an international congress every two years about Latin American philosophy. The Christian humanism and the thought of Saint Thomas Aquinas are a universal thought. Saint Thomas particularly focused the structure and thinking method. The main role of universities is to boost knowledge, and we structure knowledge through Thomas Aquinas' way of thinking.</p><h4> <br>How is Universidad Santo Tomás focused on developing the different regions of Colombia?</h4><p>We are a Multi-Campus University. We are highly committed to the development of the regions in Colombia. The university has campuses in Tunja, Villavicencio, Medellí­n, Bogotá, and Bucaramanga. We have presence in other 18 cities, through Universitary Attention Centres, which support the long, open, and distance learning process to provide education to people who live in more remote areas. That has helped us get closer to these people and has been a fundamental component for us. We also focus on e-learning and new developments. Thus, we continue to invest in technology and have excellent laboratories. For example, we have a new lab about water in Villavicencio, where people from all over that region go to conduct research. Another important factor for us is social responsibility. In Bucaramanga, for instance, we have dentist chairs that attend low-income people in the region. This is a Catholic university, which means our interest is not in generating profits, but serving the people. We have approved a new master's degree in language learning and is conducted via e-learning. E-learning allows us to provide services abroad.<br> </p><h4>What is your view on the educational sector in Colombia, and what new courses will you launch?</h4><p>We are working strongly to better spread information in every process. Digitalization is taking us in that direction, so we look at programs related to public policy, for example. We are working on business, statistics, and engineering in order to adapt our programs to those environments where information is paramount for decision making. We are focused on environment and society matters. All our research revolves around those topics.</p><h4> <br>What are your next goals for the coming years?</h4><p>I am not interested in being the “best university" in Colombia, but in being a reference for what it means to be a relevant university in this country. If someone wants to focus on what teaching means, this is the university. That is more important to us than being the first in rankings. We want to be a reference in terms of society, teaching, and providing human values to our students and the country as a whole. And we can only achieve that through quality. Quality is the only road we can go through if we want to achieve things for society. We were the first private university certified as Multi-Campus, and we have international certifications being part of a network of Latin American universities. We should look closer to North America, with the US and Canada, because there are many developments taking place there. However, there is a language barrier, though we are working on that to improve our networking with those universities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted Korn Ferry's day-to-day operations and short-term strategy?</h4><p>This is an unprecedented event that we have not faced before. I am in daily contact with Korn Ferry offices around the world, and we are all in the same boat. The main emphasis has been on three main things. Chiefly, we care about the health of our employees—that is the number-one priority, and the company is doing as much as possible to move to a home office environment. The second is business continuity, or in other words, limiting the impact on our business. The third is the business of our clients and suppliers. The business continuity of Korn Ferry alone is not enough; we need our customers and suppliers to survive as well. Overall, we foresee a 25% decrease in our revenue in every office, but that could go up to 50% if this the pandemic has prolonged effects. I am an optimistic person, and I know this will end eventually. However, we do not know how long it will take nor the damage it will do to our clients and us. Since we are in human resources, we can play a major role in boosting morale and in reconstruction after a crisis. Our business is humans. The key question isn't when this will end and when we will return to normal life, but when we will have a glimmer of hope. Once we see the glimmer of hope again, everything will change. This seems to have happened in Asia, where life is slowly getting back on track.</p><h4>How are companies in Turkey changing their workforce strategy to mitigate risks posed by the pandemic?</h4><p>We did a survey in early April 2020 of all of the companies we work with in Turkey, and we found that resilience was a common theme. Some companies had to adjust organizationally, and we expect some of these adjustments to become permanent. For example, working from home may become permanent for some staff. Most clients are not canceling their business with us, but just postponing it. We are doing a major project for a large transportation company and another for the organizational aspect of a telecoms company. They suggested we put things on hold for April and discuss the project again in the middle of May. It gives me hope that people are not cancelling, but postponing projects. There are specific industries such as telecoms and healthcare that are asking for organizational changes now. For example, we've been asked to find a new CFO for a medical supplies packaging company. However, the long-term impact is completely different; the COVID-19 pandemic will teach us a lesson how to lead our lives in a different way. Things will not be the same as they were before. Even if the pandemic disappears tomorrow, we will have a different attitude on business life.</p><h4>What specific short-term workforce needs are your clients having in Turkey?</h4><p>For the short term, crisis management, better leadership, and excellent finance operations are the three areas we're seeing demand for. The private sector in Turkey was under huge financial strain before the COVID-19 crisis, and now it is even worse. Engaging innovative finance people to make the turnaround is key. Companies will be more careful with cash management. Most of the problems over the next eight months will not come from a lack of clients, but a lack of cash management. Healthy companies and countries that have enough cash to manage until the crisis period is over will survive. Chief risk officers will be an important element for new companies and new organizational structures. As far as organization is concerned, the key will be sharing information. Companies that share information will go further, and those who employ the best people will achieve more. In a crisis mode, medium results will not be enough to help you survive.</p><h4>Looking over the long-term, what emerging trends will impact the way companies manage their operations?</h4><p>In the post-pandemic environment, the world supply chain and idea of manufacturing may change significantly. I expect to see more focus on manufacturing units being self-sufficient. As an example, we can look at the automotive sector. In the past and still often now, many factories around the world manufacture parts, and the final assembly is completed in another country. This has created a massive global supply chain, which has many advantages but has shown weaknesses during this crisis. In the future, rather than having 20 factories feeding a single assembly facility, I expect more self-sufficiency. That will be an advantage for Turkey, which has a healthy spare parts manufacturing ecosystem. Broadly, people are going to rethink supply chains.</p><h4>From a sectoral standpoint, where are you most involved now and where do you expect to see the most growth?</h4><p>Our biggest strengths in Turkey have been in manufacturing and finance. Technology and healthcare, as well as services, are our second tier. In the future, I still see industry in the lead, since it will be the main engine of Turkey for the coming decade. The second area where I see a rising star is in services, such as in petroleum distribution, transportation, supply chain, and logistics. Large holding companies in Turkey are transforming themselves. In the old days, they would do 20 businesses, and today they are thinning out and focusing on fewer sectors. Changing their management in a healthy way is a key assignment for us. What we can do is emphasize leadership, board effectiveness, learning agility, and making sure management is ready for the objectives the company has in three years' time. Considering COVID-19 is triggering a great deal of M&amp;A and reconstruction activity, our services will be in high demand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The bank was founded in 1999 by a group of experienced banking executives and a number of key shareholders. Among the founding shareholders are the current Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the bank, who began their banking careers in New York more than 30 years ago. They, and many other still connected with BiG, were responsible for launching the first private bank to be established in Portugal following the liberalization of the banking laws and the opening of the finance sector to private initiative in 1984. That wholesale corporate/institutional bank was responsible for many innovative changes to the Portuguese banking market during the 1980's-1990s and was the most successful and most profitable foreign-owned/publicly traded banks in Portugal during the period of 1984-1996. Two years after the unit was sold to a major Portuguese economic and financial group, the bank's management and a group of shareholders joined forces to establish BiG — a well-capitalized, specialized retail investment/savings bank. BiG Moçambique started operations in March 2016, following the authorization granted by Banco de Moçambique in 2014 for the establishment of a banking unit in the country. The Group's entry in Mozambique through the establishment of a subsidiary, is the logical outcome of the monitoring of Mozambican market development and the maturity reached by the operation in the country of origin. We were able to break-even in only 9 months, even considering all the Capex related to the set-up of the operation and 24 months' of Opex. During 2017 and 2018 the Bank kept its growth trajectory, and 2019 has maintained the same positive trend. Assets under management total at MZN10.4 billion (Dec-2018: MZN4.2 million; Dec-2017: MZN2.6 billion), net income is MZN241 million (Dec-2018: MZN 161 million; Dec-2017: MZN 50 million), and average ROE is 20.6% (Dec-2018: 25.7%; Dec-2017: 9.7%).</p><h4>You entered the market possibly at the worst time. How did you manage to achieve this impressive growth?</h4><p>We started looking at Mozambique in 2013, at a time when the macroconditions looked extremely positive. However, by the time we set up the bank, the financial bubble had already started bursting, so we needed to be very focused implementing our strategy and business model. We grew despite market challenges because of the innovative alternatives that we offered to our Clients, and our unique and specialized positioning in granting access to capital market products and providing dedicated asset management services to the main institutional investors in the country. Despite being able to provide all services available to the banking sector in Mozambique, we have built a dedicated team of young individuals, who are trained and focused in providing capital markets and financial advisory services to Clients, which clearly distinguishes us from other Banks in the market.</p><h4>What are your sectors of activity, and what the main milestones?</h4><p>BiG Moçambique provides specialized investment banking services, including financial advisory services and investment and savings solutions for institutional and individual clients. The Bank has already a relevant presence in Investment Banking in Mozambique, namely in capital markets, advisory and corporate finance, having participated in the main operations that occurred in those segments, being of note the arrangement and placement of corporate bond issuances for Bayport Financial Services, amounting to c. MZN 1,4 billion, and the recently completed IPO of 4% of HCB's share capital. Both transactions are claimed to be the largest (debt side and equity side) in the Mozambican capital markets. In 2019, BiG Moçambique implemented a capital increase of MZN 600 million through a private placement. The transaction included further investment from the Portuguese-based parent Banco de Investimento Global S.A. and welcomed 3 well-known Mozambican entities as new shareholders: EMOSE, Hollard Moçambique and Global Alliance (in the capacity of manager and on behalf of two local pension funds). In the first quarter of 2020, BiG Moçambique implemented a new capital increase of MZN 528.7 million, subscribed by all shareholders, reinforcing their commitment towards the Bank.</p><h4>What improvements would you like to see in the capital markets?</h4><p>Capital markets in Mozambique are still only starting, so there is a great deal to do. On the supply side, there is a lack of investment alternatives, so we need to bring more issuers to the market both on the debt and equity side, while on the buy side clients still need information and formation on local and international capital markets. They still need help to understand their savings and investments possibilities in order to increase profitability and manage risk. The liquidity of the market is also a major challenge to the development of itself, and the development of liquidity provider programs or other investment services like wealth management are essential to fulfill this need. Finally, it is essential to put more effort into selling Mozambique as a positive story with an exceptional growth potential to the outside world, since most stories about Mozambique that hit international newspapers are the bad ones, but there is a growing positive story, often ignored, that needs to be told.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The green energy space is in its infancy in Nigeria. How did you see it as a viable economic opportunity?</h4><p>It was just about looking at the numbers. At present, Nigeria is one of the largest decentralized energy markets in the world. There are about 60 million small-scale fossil fuel-based generators in the country. One knows what it costs to run those, and if you can offer a solution and service that is less expensive than that, there is profit to be made. I think that was the fundamental justification.</p><h4>Rensource Energy's business model is based on micro-utilities. Can you explain this concept?</h4><p>By using the term micro-utility, we want to distinguish it from general central power provision. Whether you are in the US or Nigeria, you get power from a centralized grid infrastructure. However, since infrastructure is so underdeveloped in Nigeria, building discrete grid infrastructure and the corresponding service provision customized for a communities' needs, whether that community be a marketplace, housing estate, or industrial park, is a more sustainable model. So rather than having one large grid you build and connect a number of small grids. This is what we mean by micro-utility. Rensource Energy is in the business of building lots of micro-utilities, but we manage them centrally with other supporting service infrastructure in the communities. We are also looking at other types of micro utilities beyond marketplaces, such as industrial clusters, housing estates or collaborating with some of the traditional electricity distribution companies (DisCos).</p><h4>Are your micro-utilities based solely on green energy?</h4><p>We focus only on solar hybrid systems. This means solar with a combination of solar, batteries and sometimes a backup fossil fuel, such as a generator. We may also explore using natural gas, but for now we are focusing solely on solar-hybrid based grids.</p><h4>How would you describe Rensource's clientele?</h4><p>Most of our business is powering large urban marketplaces such as the Sabon Gari market in Kano or Iponri market in Lagos. We are active in about six markets and we have a pipeline of another 20; however, we are also eyeing commercial and industrial clients. These are the single off-taker manufacturers, such as flour mills. Nevertheless, markets remain for now our core business. The way our model works is that while we are billing and handlings service provision to the end user of power, typically a micro-SME merchant in the market,  our contractual counter-party is the owner of the market, which is either a private individual, company, or a state government.</p><h4>What will it take to scale the company to serve large corporations?</h4><p>We already have significant additional capacity, but this is more about educating the clients about solar and how it can complement their existing power sources. A lot of these clients have already invested in self-generation, mostly generators or gas generation. Therefore, we need to justify the incremental expenditure of what we are offering them. We often do this by selling energy rather than the equipment. We incur the cost of the asset and just sell the power to the client.</p><h4>Nigerians spend over USD60 billion annually on fueling diesel generators. What can be done to change the mindset toward cleaner energy?</h4><p>There is no easy alternative. If the grid was working effectively, given it is cheaper and cleaner, people would obviously use that. Generators are not efficient, but they are easy to use. They are cheap to acquire, but expensive to run. Most people need something they can pay in small increments over time, which is what generators allow them to do. If you can offer other technologies that allow people to pay over time, they will turn to that, and I think solar can offer this. We are seeing that scaling up in Nigeria. I believe we will witness the same with natural gas, which Nigeria is blessed with.</p><h4>How is Nigeria going to overcome its power supply shortages in order to feed its envisioned economic and population growth?</h4><p>The problem is not limited to generation. There is about 12GW of installed capacity in Nigeria, but only 3.5GW on average reaches end users. There are issues across the whole value chain, from distribution and lack of metering to power theft, all the way to transmission. Therefore, it is a multifaceted problem, but thankfully there are distinct initiatives underway to address all of them. Distribution companies are investing more in sub-franchising the distribution areas to address the more challenging areas with a more hands-on approach. The World Bank has committed USD1-2 billion to transmission infrastructure in Nigeria and supporting connection fee subsidies for micro-grids. Nigeria's Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is doing excellent work. Unfortunately, not much is happening on the generation side. The last large-scale generation project was the Azura-Edo Power Plant in Edo State, but since then not much has happened because there is not a way to take that power and distribute it once its available. Once the transmission and distribution infrastructure improves, work on the generation side will pick up. It is easy to point fingers at the DisCos because they own the opportunity, but they also have their own grievances about tariffs and whether the government has held up its part of the bargain. Someone has to bite the bullet at some stage, but there is no one villain to blame.</p><h4>In light of this, what is the way out for Nigeria?</h4><p>I believe the answer is to decentralize. Whether it is natural gas, solar, or hydro, what's important is taking power to the community. That community could be as small as a market or as big as a large industrial park, housing estate, or the entire Lagos Island. I think building power resources for distinct communities is the only way Nigeria can solve the problem.</p><h4>What are your expectations from Rensource in 2020?</h4><p>We will see a more diversified offering in decentralized energy for commercial and residential clients. And in the marketplaces we provide energy, we will begin to deepen the relationship with the end-user of power by providing services that go beyond energy provision. There is a lot of spending happening on infrastructure, for good reasons. The geopolitics that drive oil prices will be quite volatile over the next year. But overall, things should improve. For Rensource Energy, it is about growth. You will hear our name a lot more and see us collaborate more actively with the existing players in the power sector. We will go beyond the narrow focus on energy for markets we have had over the last two years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which regions have the greatest housing needs? What policies could improve this situation?</h4><p>By total household numbers, eight states concentrate half of the housing deficit in Colombia: Antioquia, Bolí­var, Bogotá, Córdoba, Valle del Cauca, Cundinamarca, Nariño, and Magdalena. These numbers are highly correlated with large populations and large urbanization processes. However, analyzing the percentage of households with a deficit of total households by department, San Andrés, Chocó, Vichada, Vaupés, Guainí­a and Amazonas—i.e. the ones with the highest poverty levels—have the highest deficit rates. This is particularly true in rural zones. Nevertheless, Colombia has continuously reduced its housing deficit for more than twenty years. This has been achieved by an active housing policy that has focused on both incentivizing the demand through acquisition subsidies and developing new supply. Today, demand-side subsidies are the focus of our housing policy, giving citizens the possibility to choose where they want to live. Currently, we have developed four main programs to tackle these challenges. First is Mi Casa Ya, a program of housing subsidies designed for households with monthly incomes below USD1,070. The subsidy includes a voucher for the down payment and a subsidy for the mortgage's interest rate for a seven-year period. Second is Semillero de Propietarios, a program that targets the population that cannot get a mortgage typically because they are part of the informal economy and unbanked. This program was designed with two objectives in mind: providing a solution that allows them to access a decent house and encourage financial inclusion and helping beneficiaries establish a good credit history that makes them eligible for a mortgage in the future. Through this “social renting program“, the government subsidizes close to USD150 of the rent payment per month, while the households contribute the remaining balance, a minimum of USD 100, in addition to an agreed upon monthly savings amount. The objective is that by the end of the two-year subsidy period, these beneficiaries can apply to “Mi Casa Ya“ and buy a house of their own. Third is Casa Digna Vida Digna, is a housing and neighborhood improvement strategy that contributes to reducing the qualitative deficit in Colombia. This program includes titling, whereby households that can prove a 10-year occupancy in lands that were built informally on state-owned land are given title to the property. The other two components of the program are home improvement and public infrastructure for neighborhood amelioration (parks, schools, and nurseries, among others). Finally, we are leading a national strategy to unlock more urban land for housing developments. This includes working closely with municipalities by helping them to update their Urban Planning Framework according to the actual needs of their population and development plans, thereby properly zoning the territory and land usage in their jurisdictions.</p><h4>What policies have been created to improve the conditions of homes built with precarious materials and in risk areas?</h4><p>Casa Digna Vida Digna is our home and neighborhood improvement program, which tackles the housing qualitative deficit in three dimensions: titling for qualifying houses in informal settlements; housing interventions to improve structural and even aesthetic deficiencies; and overall neighborhood improvement. In Colombia, the qualitative deficit is twice the quantitative one. For this reason, this program is at the center of our strategy, and we have an ambitious target of 600,000 beneficiaries with improvement interventions by 2022. It is worth noting that these interventions target critical housing elements defined in the Multidimensional Poverty Index, which means that by accomplishing the program´s goal, nearly one million people will potentially be lifted out of multidimensional poverty. Furthermore, the policy promotes the guidelines set by the New Urban Agenda, introducing a new concept of housing quality: inclusiveness, resilient and sustainable housing, and quality surroundings.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been your main focus areas and achievements during this administration?</h4><p>Colombia's electricity generation matrix is one of the cleanest in the world. Nearly 70% of the electricity that Colombians consume is generated through hydropower, while 12.3% is generated through thermoelectric plants. At the same time, we have an objective to reduce our CO2 emissions through 2030 by a further 20%. Over the last 19 months in government, Colombia has taken very important steps for our energy transition and speeding up the use of non-conventional renewable sources. This will allow us to provide cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable energy for Colombians while at the same time continuing to close the existing inequality gaps.</p><h4>How relevant will clean energy resources be for future energy generation in Colombia?</h4><p>Electricity, specially generated through non-conventional renewable sources, and natural gas will continue to be the drivers of Colombia's energy transformation. That's envisioned in the National Energy Plan, a tool developed by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME), which presents possible future supply and demand scenarios in the country through 2050. According to the UPME report, electricity and natural gas demand will surpass that of liquid fuels. Currently, nearly 48% of the energy consumed in the country are liquid fuels, while natural gas and electricity represent 30%. According to our estimates, in 2050 that participation will reverse: natural gas and electricity demand will be of 46%, while that of liquid fuels will near 36%. Colombia, particularly the Caribbean region, has a huge potential for energy generation through non-conventional sources. Wind speed in La Guajira is twice as much the global average, while solar radiation there is 60% higher.</p><h4>What actions can be taken by the government to further promote development of renewable energy resources?</h4><p>Energy transition in Colombia is a reality. The country has taken a historical leap toward renewable energies, which will allow us to generate more than 12% of our electricity from solar and wind power by 2022. We will go from having less than 50MW of installed capacity for solar and wind generation, which are equivalent to the capacity that a city the size of Ibague requires, to more than 2,500MW in 2022, which the amount collectively needed by cities such as Cali, Medellí­n, Bucaramanga, Barranquilla, and Cartagena. That will be achieved through 14 generation megaprojects, attracting over COP8 trillion in investment, more than 6,000 jobs, and a 30% reduction in electricity rates for consumers.</p><h4>What opportunities do comprehensive research pilot projects (PPII) represent for Colombia?</h4><p>PPIIs are an experimental and scientific process that will be developed to evaluate the effects of fracking techniques with horizontal drilling for non-conventional fields. If these projects are successful and these resources could be further developed, experts estimate there could be between 35 and 50 additional years of gas reserves and 15 more for oil. No other source has such potential levels.</p><h4>What role do you envision the energy and mining sectors playing in the future of Colombia's economy?</h4><p>The mining-energy sector is an important revenue source for the country; 7% of the country's GDP corresponds to mining, hydrocarbon, and energy activities, and 12% of the current income for the country between 2015 and 2018 were generated through oil revenues. Nearly 38% of the FDI in the country is related to that industry, and 56% of the exports in Colombia in 2019 correspond to mining-energy resources. Additionally, the sector provides resources that boost economic and social development in regions, through the general royalty system, which for 2019 and 2020 totaled COP24.2 trillion, which is the highest amount since its creation in 2012.</p><h4>What are the priorities of the ministry moving forward?</h4><p>Our goal is to achieve a more efficient, reliable, and sustainable energy service. The experts of the Energy Transformation Mission have delivered a number of recommendations to our country, which are focused such issues as achieving a higher reliability in the energy supply for all Colombians at more efficient prices and increasing the offer and demand of natural gas by increasing the participation of generation plants, which currently has a participation of less than 12%. Other focuses include empowering energy users through the introduction of technologies, like smart meters, which will allow to make better decisions around consumption, control spending, or concerning the environment, and further focusing on energy subsidies. This, could contribute toward closing equity gaps and bring energy to more than 500,000 families who do not currently have access. Finally, we must strengthen and modernize the institutions and companies in the sector and achieve a higher level of coordination, which will allow us to respond to the new challenges in the electricity sector. Through these initiatives, the national government is working to develop a transformation roadmap that takes into account the expert recommendations, unions, businesses, and other players in the energy sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Since the arrival of Juan Gabriel Pérez to the Executive Management of Invest in Bogota in 2013, the corporation has been recognized four times by the Site Selection Magazine (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019) as the best regional investment promotion agency in Latin America and the Caribbean. In addition, the specialized magazine fDi Magazine highlighted Bogotá in 2016 as the city with the best investment promotion strategy in Latin America.</p>]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does it mean to be recognized as one of the best regional business promotion agencies in South America five times in a row by Site Selection Magazine?</h4><p>As I tell my team, we do not work for those recognitions; we work to attract foreign investment, so that companies find a long-term business in Bogotá, generate employment, bring good production practices, and initiate innovative projects. These awards raise the bar in terms of our commitment to businessmen and the city. In 13 years, we have contributed to more than 350 investment projects to the city resulting in 30,000 direct jobs and over USD2.5 billion in new investments. We are entering a phase where we will hit 50 projects a year, which is an interesting number. When this agency was created 13 years ago, there were 600 companies with foreign capital, and we are now currently close to 1,600 companies. We are always looking for new ways to contribute with productive employment and transformation to the city's business sector.</p><h4>What are your plans for the short and medium term?</h4><p>We are betting on three areas. One is entrepreneurship; therefore, we are developing an entire strategy to make Bogotá the capital of entrepreneurship in Latin America. This includes looking for new investment sources, attracting international entrepreneurs to settle in Bogotá, and above all, to promote and attract new venture capital funds. A great example is Rappi, which received USD1 billion from the Japanese Investment fund Softbank, which has also installed its headquarters in Bogotá. Another important driver is to strengthen our human talent. We are developing a project on bilingualism together with Fedesarrollo, where we seek to analyze and generate concrete actions to attract more employees to our industries. There could not exist a better environment to attract new businesses to Colombia. With the commercial setting established by the relations between China and the US, there is huge potential to attract new American and European investments.</p><h4>The IT and BPO sectors in Latin America are blooming, creating 7.5% of employment in Bogotá. How will this sector continue to contribute to the economy?</h4><p>Bogotá is a strong city in terms of services; 62% of the city's GDP comprises services. A substantial amount of employment is generated by that sector; however, if we had more human resources in the software programming area, we could have more companies, or we could see existing companies continue to grow. In addition, we are developing initiatives to boost women's participation in programming. Additionally, we are holding boot camps to run pilot tests and rapidly develop talent for the female sector. This is a city with a young population, which gives companies the assurance that there are human resources available locally in the long run. There is an opportunity to continue growing, and the service sector and creative industries will be important in the field.</p><h4>Now that the government is focused on promoting the orange economy, how will this strengthen the business environment in the city?</h4><p>If one looks at the number of audiovisual companies in Colombia, 75% is in Bogotá. We are betting extensively on it because the sector has real incentives and there is an agreement with Bogotá for the development of creative industries. It is already a powerful sector that generates many export products because content generation here is not just for the local market but also for exports. Bogotá, a megacity with around 10 million inhabitants with growing income per capita and sustained growth in recent years exceeding 3%, is attractive to world-class companies that will continue to arrive to strengthen the entire ecosystem. In the audiovisual field, our biggest competitors are Mexico and Argentina. Bogotá and Colombia are up to the task of surpassing them in terms of importance and the number of companies that arrive here. We all must take advantage of the circumstances and continue to move in the right direction.</p><h4>What other sectors do you plan to develop this year and the next?</h4><p>We are looking at five services sectors that generate value. One is the city's infrastructure, which we need to enhance. This administration advanced significantly here, though there is still a great deal of room to improve. Foreign investment plays an important role, as do PPPs in healthcare, wastewater and treatment plants, as well as public buildings that have to be built and technologies that have to be invested. In manufacturing, apart from those of added value, we are making a commitment in life sciences including the pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and medical devices sectors. Furthermore, we are promoting clinical tests in Bogotá so that drug companies take advantage of our resources in biodiversity to develop new pharmaceuticals, alternative medicines, and so on.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020, and what role will Invest in Bogotá play in the international field?</h4><p>Each year, we have around 25 campaigns to identify strategic sectors and markets. The US is extremely important, as is Europe. We are also placing more importance on Asia. I even told the board of directors, “We will stop going to China every two years and will instead go twice a year." The Chinese are not only large exporters but are also important importers and developers. This year, we brought in companies from Russia, India, Ireland, Korea, the UAE, and Barbados. We have identified 118 multilatinas with the capacity to enter Colombia, and we are also looking for anchor companies, which are defined as companies that can mobilize an entire sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Who is your target market and what opportunities have you identified in the Saudi market?</h4><p>We manufacture raw materials for plastic, so all our customers are plastic factories and convertors. The idea behind the creation of Pure Polymers was to get together a large number of small manufacturers of plastic products such as cups, trays, and pipes etc. We only target the B2B market. In Saudi Arabia, there are around 800 plastics factories, and 15 of them represent more than 85% of the market. The rest of the factories fight for the remaining 15% market share. The majority of these small factories do not have access to good raw materials or technologies. Pure Polymers provides raw materials, technologies, and technical supporter to these factories. We try to form as many partnerships and agreements with suppliers, institutes, and universities as possible to further develop our products. Our main supplier is Sabic but we also have some suppliers in India and Europe for additives and chemicals.</p><h4>What innovative trends is Pure Polymers introducing in the Saudi market?</h4><p>We are working with the Saudi Standards, Metrology and Quality Organization (SASO) on biodegradable plastic additives. We are also finding ways to develop additives to make the plastic thinner, smaller, and lighter. By doing so, we will be able to reduce consumption. Other than that, we are working on how to use plastic to support agriculture. We have partnered with a Japanese company to develop a greenhouse that uses UV protection and additives to make vegetables grow better.</p><h4>Which of your products enjoy high demand in the market?</h4><p>While regular commodities enjoy the highest demand, specialized products, such as the additives master batch and the special impact color master batch, are the most profitable. We were recently approved by Unilever to produce their personal care products using a special impact color that shines. Additives like antimicrobial master batch also enjoy good demand. They can be used in hospitals or to increase the life of products</p><h4>What differentiates Pure Polymers from other plastic companies in the Kingdom?</h4><p>We try to differentiate all of our products and improve cost efficiency. Moreover, we work with third parties such as Sabic on product development to further cut our costs. We are also integrating automated machines, in line with our strategy to always be on the lookout for innovative solutions.  We work on innovation with the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) as well as Japanese and US institutes. Our pragmatic approach enables us to finish projects faster as compared to our competitors.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the government's vision?</h4><p>Before setting up Pure Polymers, I worked for multinational companies who used to face problems when organizing sustainability events. Fortunately, the process is now much easier. Also, there is a lot of support from the government. Our idea is to enhance the use of plastic products, make it more sustainable, and tailor is to the Saudi &amp; Regional markets needs. At Pure Polymers, we support the fight against the bad consumption of single-use plastic, but we do not think it is practical to ban all kinds of plastic. We need to change the consuming behavior and spread awareness about sustainability.  </p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead, and what are your next steps in terms of international recognition?</h4><p>The industrial sector in Saudi Arabia has undergone a lot of improvement. The government has set up a new ministry of industry to make the entire process easier and flexible. The environment for SMEs and foreign investors is improving on a regular basis. There is a lot of government support for SMEs and investors. Pure Polymers mainly exports to Africa, and we are also trying to export to Middle Eastern countries. Sometimes, in order to have better market access, its necessary to open offices in the region. In line with this, we have opened an office in Dubai and a distribution hub in Egypt &amp; Ghana to cover wider markets in Middle East &amp; Africa. The biggest advantage of having a distribution hub in Egypt is that the country has FTAs with the majority of Arab and African countries as well as Egypt consumption. Moving forward, Saudi Arabia should develop more agreements with African countries because it will make it easier for Saudi base manufacturers to export their products to Africa and for us in Pure Polymers to achieve our goal of exporting 70% of our production to Africa &amp; Middle East.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us an overview of how 2019 was for As Salama Hospital?</h4><p>2019 was a good year for us. Our output was in double digits and turnaround was better than in previous years. We got an accreditation from the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI), and with that, we have reached a certain caliber of elite and quality hospitals. CBAHI is mandatory for almost all healthcare providers. The value of a CBAHI accreditation is the same as other international accreditation bodies. The CBAHI itself is accredited by International Accreditation Programme. Salama Hospital was established in 1958 and its reputation has grown over the years. This happened with the support of the administration and the hospital's culture of quality.</p><h4>What has changed since you joined the group?</h4><p>The greatest achievement was getting accredited from the CBAHI. We are getting more in line with international standards, restructuring the organization, and working to build efficiencies. We want to harness the power of the group.</p><h4>What recent economic changes have you noticed in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The government is more involved than before. There have been many surveys and a push from the government to boost the quality of service. Not only CBAHI, but the Ministry of Health has been more accessible. I've seen changes in the response time for requirements and maintaining quality. In the market, we have seen growth in valuation in recent years. I think with the Vision 2030, we are going in the right direction and pushing hard. The problem is the adaptability of the companies to catch up with the requirements, but we are trying our best. The Ministry of Health introduces directives and we are following them. We have so many current projects that we believe will help Vision 2030. We are delivering chronic patient medications to doorsteps. We also have home care and a healthcare tourism system. Our plan is to move for that kind of accreditation, and this part of monetization of healthcare for 2030 is definitely something we want to play a part in.</p><h4>How are you preparing for pandemics like the coronavirus?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health helps a lot with directives and ensures that the compliance and readiness of the hospital are at a good level. The CBAHI team came in to check our readiness, and the Ministry of Health performed another check. We also do our own assessment and check the business continuity plan. We assessed the risk and are implementing plans as needed, on top of requirements from the Ministry of Health.</p><h4>What sets As Salama Hospital apart in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We have a great team of doctors. More and more Saudi Arabian doctors are entering the market, and we want to attract them here if we can. We have three notable Saudi Arabian doctors here already. We are renowned for providing great nursing care. We also have a large geriatric and long-term center operating for more than 30 years in this field. We are a reference in the region for this service and have trained personnel on how to handle elderly. We cater to almost all levels of care of patients. In addition, our physicians are experienced. They have been serving this region, country, and hospital for a long time. Some have been in Saudi Arabia for more than 30 years. As we are a general hospital, we do not specialize in any particular field. Our patients tend to come from the middle- and lower-income classes.</p><h4>What kind of operational changes have you made to become more environmentally friendly?</h4><p>We installed LED lights, a waste management system, and a solar panel system for heating. We are careful about paper and plastic waste. We have started working on a system for e-claims and are working to improve our internal hospital information system. With that, we can grow with the head office and grow together with the other four hospitals. We need more companies to recycling materials. Most companies here are willing to participate in such initiatives, but there is a lack of companies to do the recycling. If they were more readily available, we would see a wider shift toward better waste management.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion in the future?</h4><p>We have a five-year business plan. We have completed some major external renovations already. At present, we are changing the interior and setting up new themes and equipment. Our plan is to ensure the hospital goes into a specialized sector. Although NMC As-Salama Medical Hospital is one of the oldest and renowned hospital in the LTC care, there is still a lot of room for improvement.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PR Media started its operations 16 years ago. What have been its main successes?</h4><p>PR Media was established in 2004 at a time when the agency was a pioneer in the PR sector in Morocco and more broadly North Africa. We quickly understood the interest from companies and organizations to rely on experts and dedicated services to bring their voices to a variety of audiences such as the media, consumers, influencers, and so on. We have seen some great successes. The first was our rapid development, with a presence in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. We cover these three countries with teams that have a thorough understanding of the environment, stakeholders, and local practices. We have also been affiliated with the American giant H+K Strategies since 2005, which gives us the benefit of a network of key expertise throughout Africa, both French and English-speaking. It is essential, in the context of Morocco's opening up to the continent, to be able to effectively accompany a public or private player in the field abroad. Our growth is also embodied in our human resources, namely the 50 or so consultants who make up the agency's strike force. They are organized into business units, with a precise vision of each of our clients' areas of activity. It is a great pride to have trained in Morocco specialists in influence, some of whom have been working alongside us for more than 10 years. Our third success concerns the diversity of our sectors of intervention. We cover a wide spectrum from energy to entertainment, food processing, new technologies, cybersecurity, sports, luxury goods, real estate, wellness, transport, consumer goods, and more. All these contribute to the transformation of economies throughout Morocco and Africa.</p><h4>You are an established player in the communications field. How did PR Media reach this point?</h4><p>This is the result of the recognition of our customers. We have been working with some companies since our creation, which is quite rare in our industry. Our ability to listen and adapt is also fundamental. We have successfully taken every turn in the transformations that have affected markets and consumers since the early 2000s: the mobile revolution, the internet revolution, the digital revolution, and so on. In Africa, Morocco is often at the forefront in these areas. We have evolved by being proactive, accompanying changes, and even showing pedagogy toward our customers, who are not always informed and aware of new uses. I am thinking in particular of the major role of digital technology in terms of influence. We can no longer be content to communicate through the press. A few years ago, we, therefore, created a subsidiary entirely dedicated to digital and the management of e-influencers and digital communities. Moroccans are connected, and we are connected with them.</p><h4>PR and communications remain a highly competitive market. How do you differentiate yourselves from other agencies?</h4><p>PR Media is a leading agency because our expertise is recognized, and our clients' interests are our top priority. We develop relevant and effective strategies for them, often going beyond what they expect and with concrete, measurable results in line with their objectives. This is our corporate culture: always do better, always do more. I am convinced the difference lies as much in the consulting aspect as in the purely operational aspect of our business. In this sense, our support and our ability to guide are strongly differentiating elements.</p><h4>How do you make sure you remain up to date in such a fast-paced digital world?</h4><p>PR Media has a strategic monitoring department that regularly updates our working standards, tools, and methods. This allows us to stay one step ahead of the transformations that will impact our activities. More broadly, we have reviewed our organizational model by abandoning the traditional silo-based operation and moving from a vertical to a horizontal structure. All of our departments are working toward the same goal: that of our development, with the support of technologies that accelerate production times and become a determining factor in growth.</p><h4>What is your assessment of AI, big data, and automation? Do you see yourselves benefiting from these new technologies in the near future?</h4><p>We are benefiting from them today in fact. Knowledge of audiences is fundamental to effectively carry the voice of our clients. We conduct regular research to better understand the expectations of journalists, influencers, consumers, and citizens in general. We thus rely on advanced analytical tools with which we can better identify not only the major themes of conversations on social networks, for example, but also their tone. The predictive data offered by AI is also a way to target the content that will have the greatest impact. It is useful to determine which ones generate the most consultations, with the production of reports that reduce the time spent browsing the data and examining the numbers. We also use platforms that help us monitor media and predict the impact of news on our clients' image.</p><h4>What is your presence abroad today; do you envision new markets?</h4><p>PR Media is a Moroccan agency, with a North African geographic footprint and a reach that covers the entire continent and beyond. With our affiliation with H+K Strategies, we can operate in all territories, relying on teams that have a perfect understanding of the environments of each country where they are located. We are, therefore, a local but also a global agency, with the conviction that digital technology is changing the notion of borders.</p><h4>What is your target for 2020? How do you aim to position yourselves?</h4><p>We have successfully evolved from a PR agency to an influence consultancy firm. In 2020, this trend will continue with the in-house development of new services and skills based on the possibilities offered by recent technological developments, with more prediction, real-time data analysis and fine knowledge of our audiences. However, we are also convinced people remain at the center of everything we do. While AI and big data will play an increasingly important role in our activities, our experts remain the privileged interlocutors of our customers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the scope of your business in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>At present, we are working in an integrated Joint venture with Bechtel and Al Mabani on Lines 1 &amp; 2 of the Riyadh Metro and with a consortium with Siemens.   We are also working on other oil and gas projects in Jizan with ARAMCO as well as a project for Jeddah Airport with Bin Laden Group.  We are also looking at the smart cities and entertainment facilities to be built in NEOM, The Red Sea, AMAALA, Qiddiya, and Diriyah. We believe we can help the government to achieve its Vision2030.  We can bring valuable knowledge and experience mainly as a General Contractor where we can handle a wide range of services encompassing project management, engineering, procurement, construction and installation for multi discipline construction contracts.</p><h4>What role does Saudi Arabia play in CCC's portfolio?</h4><p>We have been continuously working in Saudi Arabia for almost 60 years, and on average, 20% of CCC's revenues per year have been generated in Saudi Arabia. Our scope of work covered building, heavy civil and road works, and oil &amp; gas related projects. For example, we constructed the College of Petroleum followed by the University of Petroleum, Jubail Commercial Harbor, Jeddah III Power and Desalination, Ministry of Petroleum Viaduct in Riyadh now called Gulf Bridge, Ras Tanura Refinery, Hawiyah and Haradh GOSPs, Shaybah Infrastructure, Residential &amp; Industrial Complex, Shaybah Producing Facilities, Kharasaneyah Gas Plant, and Jazzan Aramco Oil &amp; Gas Development etc. As you can see, CCC is fully committed to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your work on the Riyadh Metro?</h4><p>Riyadh Metro is the biggest urban project in the world.  It is extremely challenging to construct six lines in Riyadh city at the same time.  It demands close coordination between various parties involved with the construction to ensure the minimum disruption to the residents of Riyadh, the interface involved with Utility relocation, traffic diversion and the project completion schedule.  The project is progressing well and we started the train test runs of Line 2.  We take pride in being part of this project.  It has been a great experience for us as it is our biggest project to date.</p><h4>What is your growth projection for the construction sector in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is a big country and is continuously developing. Major growth will be in the infrastructure and buildings related to planned growth of tourism such as the Red Sea Development, health care, and developing new oil &amp; gas fields such as Jafurah Gas Field.</p><h4>What will Saudi Arabia's economy look like in 10 years?</h4><p>We can expect the economy to be more diverse and less dependent on oil revenues. We can also expect growth in tourism related industries, more Private Public Partnerships (PPP) especially in transportation, healthcare, and utilities such as telephone and electricity. Water privatization is already well-developed, and we expect more Saudis involved in both the white color and the blue color labor sector.  Saudi Arabia is the largest country in the Gulf region with geographical diversity and huge potential for the tourism sector.</p><h4>Can you tell us a bit about the role of sustainability in CCC projects?</h4><p>CCC is a proud supporter of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and is contributing towards them in several ways such as aligning sustainability priorities with the relevant SDGs and sharing our sustainability performance publicly based on the GRI Standards. Our sustainability initiatives, core values of CO2 reduction and sustainable construction from remote locations have benefited local communities where we work and we have provided these locations with vocational training.</p><h4>What is CCC's strategy to innovate and support start-ups, and how does that help CCC's position as a market leader? </h4><p>Inspired by the World Economic Forum's (WEF) vision for the future of construction and guided by the emerging technologies highlighted in their latest reports, CCC announced in 2017 the “CCC Innovation and R&amp;D initiative" as a major milestone for the years to come. The aim of this initiative is to maintain CCC's position and legacy as a market leader, not only by improving current practices but also by finding a new niche for itself in the marketplace. CCC created an R&amp;D task force to source internal process improvement as well as business opportunities arising from these technologies.  The initiatives later on extended to cover startup strategic partnerships to drive the transformation imperatives and develop pilot projects as a proof of value.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main areas of focus and milestones in 2019?</h4><p>2019 was an important year in terms of the development of the telecom sector in Colombia. We had a major overhaul in terms of regulation and framework. The new regulation features several elements that are crucial for the future of Colombia's telecommunications sector. The first element is spectrum allocation, which creates a much more certain environment and allows a greater investment. Under the Law of Modernization of the ICT sector (law 1978 of 2019) our policy has changed from maximizing financial income to maximizing social wellbeing. In 2019, not only we were able to modify the legal framework, we also established a convergent regulator. This was one element that the OECD was particularly insistent on. Notably, we set up the entire spectrum allocation process within a couple of months. We created free internet zones across the country. Nowadays, there are 1,000 of them in rural areas and 870 in urban areas. The government's policy for the sector can be divided between connectivity and digital transformation. We are undertaking the most ambitious social connectivity program that the country has ever seen.</p><h4>How is Colombia implementing its 5G plan?</h4><p>Colombia is one of the few countries in the region with a 5G plan. We took a lot of input from different sources and integrate it into our 5G plan. We have already opened an expression of interest process for companies, telecoms operators, and anybody else who has projects that can bring use cases for 5G to Colombia. Once we have those, we will evaluate them and promote them in medium-sized cities. We all know 5G is probably more suited for big cities, but we still encourage thinking out of the box.</p><h4>What is the ambition of the government for Colombia's digital transformation?</h4><p>We have the WEF-certified Center For the Fourth Industrial Revolution in Medellin. We are creating a digital ecosystem, connecting certain infrastructure and services to enable sharing and analyzing of information needed for IoT. Our goal is to not just be a participant but a leader in Latin America.</p><h4>How is the ministry ensuring that Colombia has the talent to bring IoT to real life?</h4><p>We are working with the Ministry of Education on several initiatives. One such initiative is Coding for Kids, a program that is currently serving 23,000 students in public schools. 30% of these students are from rural areas. In 2020, we aim to cover more than 60,000 students. We need or must to ensure that we have relevant programs in universities and educational institutions to prepare the youth for the future. Employability is at the root of what we do. In 2020, we will also launch the pilot data science course called Data Science for All. We introduced a similar program online for AI in 2019 and remarkably, we received 50,000 applications for 12,000 slots. This shows that Colombians want to learn skills related to the fourth industrial revolution. We are doing this as SENA, which is our technical education organization. We will continue to find new ways to create the optimal digital ecosystem for a digital society.</p><h4>How are you implementing digital transformation in the public sector? </h4><p>Things should start at home and that is exactly what we are doing. President Iván Duque Márquez is fully aware of the importance of the fourth industrial revolution, which is why he hired a presidential advisor on digital transformation. Instead of taking small steps forward, we are working with other governments that have successfully applied digital transformation strategies. We adopted the X Road platform from Estonia and the digital government model from México. The digital transformation of the government is based on the fact that what we do has to have an impact on the citizen. We have already launched the beta version of the single government website called gov.co. We redesign processes and ways of doing things before integrating them into the single government platform. Last year, we worked hard on the architecture of the platform and we will push it out to citizens in 2020. We are bringing connectivity to rural areas, and this will change the way people learn, work, and interact with the rest of the world.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next few years?</h4><p>My ambition is to connect all the parts of the country. This is a difficult task to achieve in a country like Colombia. Every other sector is building on the IT and communications sector. I cannot imagine any entrepreneur, business, or academic endeavor that does not need this industry to thrive. As digital services become a part of daily life, we have the perfect window to transform into a digital society. Being able to do things like pay taxes digitally will generate curiosity among citizens about other things that the digital ecosystem can provide. We play our part in creating a more equal society.</p><h4>Can you comment on the gender diversity within the government?</h4><p>We still have challenges, but the cabinet is a gender parity cabinet. In fact, at present, more women are part of the government, which is in line with the president's vision to create equal opportunities. In the tech sector specifically, gender parity is a challenge as women are underrepresented in terms of CEO and engineers. We are working on policies to make sure we can attract more women to be part of the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>IsDB has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with a USD2.3 billion package for its 57 member countries. Can you outline the global objectives of the package?</h4><p>The IsDB Group management prepared an emergency response program called the “Triple R" (Response, Restore, and Restart) devised to support Member Countries (MCs) with prevention, containment, mitigation, and recovering from the impacts of COVID19 pandemic with science and technology playing a key role at each stage through online country platforms in close cooperation with almost all development partners, a task facilitated by the IsDB Group President's present Chairmanship of the world's Multilateral Development Banks as His Excellency is also conducting close networking with other major partners and senior officials within G20, the Organization  of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and the Arab Coordination Group. The “Triple R" package's “Respond" track delivers immediate actions through South-South and North-South Reverse Linkage operations focused on most urgent needs in healthcare. The “Restore" track deals with medium-term actions through lines of financing for trade and SMEs to sustain activity in core strategic value chains. And finally, the “Restart" track delivers long-term actions to build resilient economies on solid foundations and catalyze private investments. In line with the above, the IsDB Board of Executive Directors has approved a USD2.3 billion financial emergency package for various member countries hardest hit by the pandemic. So far, IsDB has received 39 requests from MCs for assistance and the process of providing financial and other modes of support to these MCs is already in progress. In the meantime, the Bank has launched a blockchain based online country platform that facilities more efficient aid from production and procurement to end-user delivery.</p><h4>How has the Group's COVID-19 response directly impacted Turkey?</h4><p>As for Turkey, we are happy to see that the new Okmeydanı hospital in Istanbul, which was funded by the IsDB, opened its doors to COVID19 patients on 31st March 2020 providing more than 600 beds and 99 intensive care units (ICUs). The IsDB Group is also availing USD250 million to Turkey to deal with the challenges of fighting COVID19. Additionally, the Bank will also expedite the effectiveness and utilization of a USD100 million facility that was approved for Turk Eximbank in December 2019 for the benefit of exporting companies that are affected by COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h4>IsDB has financed a wide range of projects in Turkey—most notably large-scale energy and transport projects as well as smaller-scale investments in the export sector. What role does the export sector play in IsDB's strategy in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey's growth strategy relies on transforming its economy into a high-tech export-oriented private sector-led competitive one, as outlined by the 11th Development Plan of Turkey (2019-2023). In order to help Turkey achieve its development targets, IsDB approved a USD270 million Line of Financing Facility (LoF-I) under the Restricted Mudaraba modality to Turk Eximbank to finance capital expenditures of SMEs and middle capitalization companies in 2015. This facility was fully disbursed in less than 18 months and contributed to creation of more than 1,000 jobs and facilitated an increase in revenues of end-beneficiary companies by more than USD1 billion. Due to success of this facility, a new facility (LoF-II) was approved by IsDB amounting to USD100 million in 2019. This new facility will be extended under Murabaha financing mode for a tenure of 10 years. Financing facilities targeting the promotion of exports and SMEs have great potential to create development impact for Turkey. Turk Eximbank has also cooperated with Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit's (ICIEC) and concluded three projects with ICIEC (approximately USD411 million) to support Turkish contractors for their construction projects in Cameroon and Senegal. ICIEC also provided an insurance coverage for the club loan facility of Turk Eximbank in the amount of EUR180 million in addition to the insurance cover provided for a bilateral loan of EUR100 million finalized in 2016. The objective of those interventions is to support the exports of SMEs as well as the projects undertaken by Turkish contractors in member countries. Going forward, we would like to expand our collaboration with Turk Eximbank and continue supporting Turkish exporters through providing long term financing facilities for their CAPEX requirements, short-term trade finance facilities, and insurance coverage to facilitate financing their projects in other countries and investments in Turkey.</p><h4>How has the International Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) — the trade financing arm of the IsDB Group — furthered the Group's export objectives in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey has been one of the largest recipients of the ITFC's trade financing facilities. ITFC has approved 78 financing operations for 30 different clients for a total amount of USD5 billion in Turkey which represents about 10% of total trade financing approvals of ITFC. Supporting SMEs especially for their export financing requirements is one of the strategic pillars of ITFC which has always given priority for partnership with local banks in Turkey for developing export financing facilities for SMEs. In this regard, ITFC's partnership with Turk Eximbank is worth to mention here. ITFC has provided a total of USD3.21 billion export financing through Turk Eximbank for the benefit of Turkish SMEs. Besides Turk Eximbank, ITFC has been collaborating with different banks in Turkey, mainly the Islamic banks and the investment banks, and approved a total amount of USD410 million, so far. Large corporates in Turkey have been benefiting from direct lines of ITFC under the structured trade finance facilities, which provide tailor made solutions for the import or pre-export financing needs. ITFC has implemented 22 operations for several reputable private sector clients for a total amount of USD757 million with an excellent track record. In this model, ITFC purchases agricultural commodities, which are stored in the bonded warehouses, and within an agreed tenor the client purchases those commodities from ITFC.</p><h4><br></h4><h4><br></h4><h4>IsDB Group is notable for its financing of energy projects in Turkey. Can you outline IsDB Group's involvement in the sector and how its facilities have been necessary for its development?</h4><p>During the last five years, IsDB Group has provided almost USD740 million for energy infrastructure projects of the private sector, facilitating almost USD3 billion worth of new investments. These investments were generally in renewable energy (RE) sub-sectors such as hydro, wind, solar, geothermal, and waste management to improve energy efficiency in industrial facilities and upgrade and modernize electricity and natural gas distribution infrastructure. As a result of these investments, around 1,340MW of new RE power generation capacity was introduced. The energy efficiency investments also resulted in around 2,170 GWh/year of energy savings, almost equivalent to the annual generation of 1,000MW of solar power. These investments, altogether, helped the elimination of more than 3.2 million tons of CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Hence, IsDB is significantly contributing to Turkey's efforts toward reducing energy import dependency and current account deficit as well as tackling GHG emissions. The high cost of financing is a significant challenge facing investors. Hence, to support new investments, we aim to leverage our financing and mobilize private sector funds through market-based structures. IsDB's AAA rating provides a significant opportunity to help Turkish energy investors access relatively lower cost funding.</p><h4>Similarly, IsDB Group has been instrumental in financing transport projects in Turkey. Specifically looking to the rail sector, what projects has the IsDB funded?</h4><p>During 2015-2019, IsDB contributed USD1,120 million in seven transport projects. Until 2019, three transport projects with USD609 million IsDB financing have been completed, and four projects worth USD511.3 million are under implementation. Looking to rail, currently, IsDB is contributing EUR312 million to the 10 high-speed train sets projects and EUR150 million for the urban transport program. Overall, the transport sector projects have enabled enhancement of inter and intra-connectivity and inter-modal shift toward safer, more reliable, and more efficient rail transportation system while increasing connectivity within and between major urban centers and with the industrial zones, thus fostering economic growth and employment generation in related sub-industries. IsDB looks forward to contributing in the development of fuel-efficient, sustainable, and environment-friendly future initiatives.</p><h4>From both a financial product development and equity standpoint, how has IsDB been involved in the development of the participation banking sector in Turkey?</h4><p>IsDB Group has been closely supporting the Islamic finance industry in Turkey since the establishment. We support the development of regulatory frameworks and enabling environment, facilitation for launching innovative Islamic finance products, and the creation of a fully Islamic tranche allowing participation banks to support infrastructure projects. One of our achievements is the listing of IsDB Sukuk on Borsa Istanbul, which enabled IsDB to diversify its investor base and reinforce its presence in an important financial center. There are also ongoing efforts to develop Islamic capital markets further. IsDB Group is currently working with the Ministry of Treasury and Finance to make the necessary legal and regulatory changes to structure an Ijara-based project sukuk modality. As a direct consequence of mobilizing Islamic resources via innovative modalities, IsDB will be able to expand its interventions and fund the infrastructure assets in a more impactful manner. IsDB's support for the Islamic banking sector is also in the form of equity participation in Islamic banks and financial institutions.</p><h4>How has IsDB Group worked to create joint-financing opportunities for participation banks in Turkey for infrastructure projects?</h4><p>In its intention to streamline part of globally available resources for infrastructure development of its member countries, IsDB has introduced the A/B financing structure. The structure envisages financing of projects in two tranches: A-tranche, the IsDB Group's direct exposure, and B-tranche, a syndication from other market participants (B-Participants). Both tranches are implemented on pari passu basis. B-participants benefit from IsDB Group's preferred creditor status in all of its member countries. As per our preferred creditor status, our member countries acknowledge IsDB as the lender of record and honor the preferential treatment by allowing foreign exchange convertibility and transferability in priority. Our A/B financing structure is the only Islamic A/B-product available in the market. We would like participation banks to be involved more in infrastructure projects. They can be part of city hospital projects, transport or energy related ones. Recently, we have witnessed announcement of large-scale manufacturing projects of strategic nature in Turkey. Participation banks should support those initiatives and demonstrate the added value of Islamic finance in development of Turkey. In order to facilitate this, IsDB Group can support participation banks here through the A/B financing structure as we have done previously. IsDB also stands ready to support the capacity of participation banks in Turkey through workshops, seminars, training programs, and conferences. Eventually, we would like to promote Islamic banking and see Islamic institutions in Turkey in the ranks of major financial players.</p><h4>Over the next 12 months, what are the IsDB Group's most important plans in Turkey?</h4><p>Over the next 12 months, IsDB Group will continue supporting Turkey in its strategic priority sectors. This continued strategic and programmatic support is meant to particularly: ensure Turkey's energy supply security through building underground gas storage capacity through BOTAS, help Turkey develop more seismic resilient infrastructure through ISMEP, and support upgrading of Turkey in global value chains through PPP projects such as Ceyhan Petrochemicals Plant Project. IsDB Group would also be working closely with the government of Turkey to come up with a response package to support the country to mitigate the adverse impact of COVID-19. This includes providing lines of finance to public sector banks to support private-sector companies in the priority industrial sectors as well as providing risk insurance to investors in the country as well as enabling access of Turkish investors to other markets.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the positioning of Quito as a tourism destination evolved?</h4><p>Quito acts as the gate to Ecuador's four worlds: the Pacific coast, the Andes, the Amazon, and the Galápagos Islands. The city has made efforts to promote Quito as a tourism destination. In terms of international promotion, Quito has been implementing its strategy for 2020 and 2021 to develop the city for foreign visitors. To that end, one of the priorities is to improve the connectivity of Quito by establishing new agreements with airlines. Second, we have established representation offices abroad to attract more tourism to Quito. The strategic plan developed in 2016 evaluates different markets and identifies nine priority markets: the US, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Spain, the UK, and Germany. In those nine markets, the strategy is to hire a public relations agency able to handle Quito's promotion in an efficient manner. We have developed agreements with airlines such as Avianca, Interjet, JetBlue, Gol, Air Canada, and American Airlines, to name a few. In all, tourism is an industry that needs to be built over the long term.</p><h4>Tourists from Asian countries, especially China, are showing more interest in Ecuador. Which opportunities is Quito targeting in this regard?</h4><p>Ever since I took over the management of Quito Turismo, we have been conducting extensive research on Asian markets. Currently, it can take up to three days for tourists from Asian countries to come to Ecuador. With that in mind, we have been working on increasing the number of direct flights. Equally important, we are developing more information in Asian languages in order to better promote Ecuador and prepare the country's offer accordingly. Thanks to our efforts, tour operators are tapping an increasing number of Asian markets. We aim to promote similar initiatives in the future. We are also working on marketing plans that will enable us to prepare short- and long-term strategies.</p><h4>Which new products are being developed for Quito?</h4><p>MICE tourism is one of our priorities, and we have a division only focused on MICE tourists. Our international network is promoting Quito at international events. We are also approaching various chambers of commerce and associations to let them know that Quito is open to organize events. We are willing to offer tailor-made products to attract MICE events to Quito. We have held numerous events in 2019, and we are set to hold more in years to come. MICE tourists have high purchasing power, and they bring a lot of knowledge from different areas in the world, which can help us come up with new ideas. We want to host the world's largest events. We are also planning to host sports events because they bring a whole host of new opportunities. In 2018, we received around 690,000 tourists and for 2019, the estimation is 705,000. Our goal is to receive 4 million tourists within four years, and MICE tourism can help us achieve that.</p><h4>What new programs are you developing to revamp the center of Quito?</h4><p>We have a program to refurbish the center of Quito. There are about 26 properties that we are planning to revamp in Quito's historical center. We are also in talks to open a Hyatt hotel. We are offering these 26 properties to potential investors. To that end, Quito Turismo is preparing a portfolio for 2020. We are also working to create heritage areas to attract foreign investment. The goal is to award concessions to establish an art gallery, a hotel, or any other kind of business that can revitalize the center. We must bring more international chains that are not present in Quito. The majority of tourists do not stay in the historical center. They stay in the north of the city and go to the center for a day visit. That said, there are some top-notch boutique hotels like Carlota, and many more will open in the near future.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which different stakeholders are working under the Chamber of Tourism of Manta to consolidate tourism in the area?</h4><p>The chamber is split into four categories: hotels, travel agencies and tourism operators, bars and restaurants, and transportation. The chamber seeks to develop MICE tourism through events and conferences and creating the necessary spaces. Manta receives a good share of tourists coming to the Manabí­ province, as the city has an airport and a cruise terminal for better connectivity.</p><h4>Manta is regarded as having great potential to develop tourism. What are its competitive advantages?</h4><p>We have the right conditions, especially when compared to other coastal cities in the country. We have over 2,000 four- and five-star beds, the best sea and air travel accessibility, and connectivity through roads. A multiplier effect has given us a head start with the diversification of the economy. Complementary tourism services and commercial activity are created around those elements, and that in turn serves as great conditions for more hotels to be built and so on.</p><h4>How will the opening of the cruise terminal and new airport influence the development of the sector?</h4><p>We have seen the impact mostly in the number of hotels currently being built to try to get ahead of the expected increase in tourism. Hospitality development is the most important indicator of the sector's growth, as it is the most direct business representing tourism. The more beds there are, the more options there are for people to stay. However, the hotel industry depends on occupation rates being high, so every new hotel serves as an ambassador and a micro marketing agency for the city by investing in promoting tourism into Manta.</p><h4>Tourism in Manta is also supported by a strong corporate sector. What other activities have potential in Manta?</h4><p>Our strong logistic sector is one. Over 95% of all imported cars in Ecuador, for example, are imported through our port, which is a key for our economic growth. Trade plays a big supporting role for our exports, and there is great potential for us to be the main port of exports for national products. Currently, 70% of Ecuador's tuna is exported through Manta. All this commercial activity creates business visits that fuel our tourism sector. Along those lines, sport fishing is an activity with enormous potential. Another trend we can jump on is agroindustry tourism. Similar to Colombia's coffee trails, we could develop tours and activities around cacao for people to get close to the production and commercialization of the best chocolate in the world. In general, we need to develop more activities for people to stay in the city. An important measurement in tourism is the length of stay, and there we have a lot of room to grow. People come to Manta for any specific activity like the half Ironman race and then leave. We need to create activities that entice them to stay longer and do more in the city. Our biggest challenge, though, is tourism infrastructure. We are working with the municipality to build roads into our beaches, create bathroom facilities, and connect the city better.</p><h4>Regarding investments, what makes the sector an attractive option for foreign capital?</h4><p>Historically, Manta has been an attractive city for foreigners to invest in business around retirees and expats living in Ecuador. Our natural resources and weather conditions are excellent for opening year-round touristic business. The San Francisco University of Quito, the best-ranked in the country, is considering opening a campus in Manta. There are important synergies being strengthened, and the existing commercial offering is ripe for further hospitality developments. Most importantly, there is a significant amount of prime beachfront land eligible for hotel construction.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How important is Galápagos as a destination for Metropolitan Touring?</h4><p>Metropolitan Touring started as an outbound agency in 1953, but soon the company realized the potential of Ecuador and started its inbound operations. Galápagos already had scientific importance because of its unique flora, fauna, and history, but visiting it had enormous challenges. We have played a key role in the protection of this precious asset, having worked hand in hand with the environmental authority to create regulations that currently are the model for exploring the Galápagos National Park. These standards are needed in order to preserve the uniqueness of Galápagos for future generations, and to make sure visitors do not have a critical impact on the islands' ecosystems. Galápagos is the crown jewel of Ecuador's tourism sector. Both the public and private sectors have been working to create synergies between this destination and others. Foreign travelers cannot reach Galápagos without going to Quito or Guayaquil. It is important to focus on other parts of the country so that travelers can better discover Ecuador. With this mindset, Metropolitan Touring established Mashpi Lodge, a hotel built in some of the most biodiverse forests in Ecuador. This area has been declared a biosphere reserve by UNESCO. Our aim is to replicate the same level of environmental protection as in Galápagos.</p><h4>What areas in Ecuador have the potential to become tourist destinations?</h4><p>For those willing to discover Ecuador, there is a need to connect all parts of the country. We must also assess the diversity of attractions and possible differentiators between our attractions and others, as we are competing with destinations such as Indonesia, the Maldives, Colombia, and Peru. There are some regions with great tourism potential such as the Manabí­ province in the Pacific coast. Recently, connectivity has improved, in part because of LATAM Airlines opening flights. Another region with great potential to develop in Ecuador is the entire highlands region. It is especially attractive because Ecuador has better access to the Andes mountain range as compared to other neighboring countries. For example, we can entice tourists by developing glamping sites, which have become a trend of late. Glamping is a less expensive and nicer option for modern travelers. Moreover, we can visit haciendas, large lands owned by families for centuries, and offer them to discerning travelers. These options will provide extra income for local communities, most of whom mainly depend on income from farming-related activities. Such options could be further developed to add more attractiveness to Ecuador's tourism offering.</p><h4>What changes have you noticed in inbound tourism in Ecuador after the arrival of new airlines?</h4><p>Metropolitan Touring's largest flow of visitors still comes from the US. In general, better air connectivity is helping to bring more explorers into the country. Something highly beneficial for the sector would be to have direct flights between Ecuador and Germany, which is our largest European market. Moreover, we are welcoming the evolution of our domestic market, where cheaper fares are gaining prominence. A low-cost airline operating within the country is the need of the hour. Additionally, there needs to be more effort to improve regional connectivity with neighboring countries. When travelers come to South America, they almost always visit more than just one country. We must ensure that travelers have affordable and flexible options to go from Ecuador to countries like Colombia and Bolivia. This will further boost visitor numbers and improve the regional tourism offering.</p><h4>What investment opportunities does the tourism sector have in Ecuador?</h4><p>Quito's historic center has great opportunities for development. Hoteliers are not the only ones who could take advantage of these opportunities, but mixed-use investments in that area of Quito could also yield great benefits. I see opportunity in related services for guests, from offering bicycles to cell phone chips and lockers. All such peripheral services are needed here, and there is room for specialized companies.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advancements have marked the IT ecosystem in Ecuador in recent years?</h4><p>Over the last five years, the telecommunications area has been growing significantly in Ecuador. The network has improved, and now we talk about a country covered by fiber optics being the second country in Latin America in terms of internet speed. The number of people with internet access has increased, and this ecosystem has helped digital businesses flourish. E-commerce has become an important tool, while data use and IP have expanded. The entrepreneurial landscape has grown tremendously due to these changes. In fact, in 2014, Kruger founded KrugerLabs, a digital accelerator dedicated to the entrepreneurial community in Ecuador. Today, with all these components together, the country has great potential to grow in the digital arena.</p><h4>How are Ecuadorian firms of all sizes making use of technology to gain competitiveness internationally?</h4><p>Industries are putting in efforts to maintain competitiveness standards and compete with international counterparts. Ecuador and its business sectors need to fully embark on the fourth industrial revolution through the adoption of exponential technologies including AI, blockchain, and drones. The adaptation of these technologies is relatively slow in the country and the region, though it is important to embrace them quickly in order to compete worldwide. Ecuador at this moment is aware of all the changes happening with regard to technology, and there is willingness to implement them; however, steps need to be taken faster so that Ecuador becomes an early adopter. There are national industries that are more advanced, such as agriculture. Blockchain and drones are being used to make operations more efficient. For example, AI is being used to determine that when shrimps, one of our largely exported products, make noises, they are hungry; however, two sectors, mining and energy, have yet to see further penetration of technology in line with global trends.</p><h4>To what extent can the country be used to test new technologies?</h4><p>Given the existing technological community in the country, Ecuador is well-positioned to test initiatives that can be applied in other markets. The app Waze is an example, which was first tested in Ecuador. Google then acquired Waze for USD1 billion to make it global. There is also an insurance company that first tested its products in Ecuador and then exported them to Mexico. The country has certain features such as different levels of social layers, excellent connectivity, and an optimal population size that make it an interesting test market.</p><h4>What are your main goals for Kruger Corporation for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are in the process of expanding our presence in Latin America, while keeping our presence strong in Ecuador. The country has a huge potential to grow and consolidate a market-friendly economy that can be truly competitive abroad. The country has a great perspective for 2020. There are elections coming, but the important thing is that the state has to be led by technocrats and ideology should stay out of debates.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Telefónica's presence in Ecuador expanding in support of the digitalization of the country's economy?</h4><p>Telefónica has bet on Ecuador, and as a result, we continue to make investments of about USD150 million annually in network growth and digital services development. Based on our experience in several countries, we show the local business community how to be cost efficienct and improve their profitability and productivity through our digital services. In this regard, we have diversified our portfolio by moving from being just a telecoms provider to an enabler of digitalization in Ecuador. Companies are looking for ways to be more cost and expense effective and seeking to invest more in capital expenditures instead of operating expenses. In this scenario, Teléfonica, for example, offers its digital portfolio through monthly payments. We divide this portfolio into five verticals addressed at satisfying specific corporate needs such as security and information, cloud services, IoT, digital advertising, and information from heat maps.</p><h4>How are Telefónica's digital solutions used to support the development of Ecuador's strategic sectors?</h4><p>Our solutions can be applied across all sectors of the economy. In the agricultural sector, Ecuador's biggest exporting sector after oil, we bring solutions to the local market for livestock control to help track the location of animals and even determine if an animal leaves a virtual fence via radio-frequency identification (RFID). We have also started to use heat maps to determine the best locations for cashiers, new stores, POS, and even metro stations. Telefónica is proud to have worked in Quito's metro network project to help the municipality decide the most optimal locations. These tools allow one to decide how to transform digitally. On top of that, Teléfonica's location, EcoPark, is an extraordinary example of what can be achieved through digitalization. The entire complex is digitally monitored, and we have walked hand in hand with most of the companies or entities with locations in Ecuador such as Produbanco, Nestlé, Avianca, the UN, and Chubb to help them embrace the digital era.</p><h4>How will expenditure on IT evolve in the short term from both a public and private perspective?</h4><p>Corporations are quick to see the need of digitizing in order for their operations and services to be competitive. In the public arena, the opportunity in the government to digitalize is immense. We have worked with the public administration at different levels on several projects, one of them being Quito's metro network. Tourism is also a strategic sector for Ecuador, and we are working with the Ministry of Tourism to take advantage of tourism-related big data. We are gathering data on how many foreigners enter Ecuador, where they go, how they move, and where they stay, which are all useful not only for the Ministry of Tourism to determine its policies, but for all stakeholders in the sector. Our services are also being used by the national transit agencies to track mobility trends, which is useful in the area of road deployment or traffic management. The country's administration is moving toward an e-administration or e-government, though the pace should be quicker in order to catch up with international and regional trends. Nevertheless, the advantage of Ecuador is that it has similar characteristics to countries that develop rapidly, and its relatively small size makes it manageable and easy to roll out solutions.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ecuador Digital strategy expected to shape the telecommunication landscape in the country?</h4><p>Ecuador's government has decided to boost the telecommunications sector and make it one of the most important development engines for the country's growth. For every 10% growth in the spectrum bandwidth, the country can grow 1% of its GDP. Currently, Ecuador has only consumed 26% of the electromagnetic spectrum. Ecuador has an untapped market of 70% that can be used for commercial purposes. The ministry will be allocating 35% of the band spectrum over 2020 for current or new operators. In the last five years, we have received about USD1.7 billion for assigning the spectrum, which can increase as the spectrum is further assigned. Following Chile and Colombia's examples, that money will be reinvested in the sector, leaving us approximately USD1 billion for infrastructure development to generate better connectivity. We are tendering the 700GHz, 2.5GHz, and 3.5GHz bands, which will allow us to initiate 5G coverage deployments. Our first goal is to cover 98% of the country with 4G connectivity by 2021. One way to achieve this is to broaden the spectrum and demand connectivity programs. The second is to use the entire electrical network. Ecuador has one of the biggest electrical infrastructures in Latin America with about 5,600km of electric transmission connected throughout the country. Our legislation allows for the electric transmission to also transmit internet connection. CELEC, the national electricity company, will soon start to be the carrier of internet distributors. The third way is to look for other strategic alliances that allow us to provide internet at a low cost to remote areas of the country. Another objective of Ecuador Digital is to provide e-government solutions through an online platform, <a href="http://www.gob.ec">www.gob.ec</a>, which centralizes more than 4,000 procedures. We have set up a committee to simplify and eliminate paperwork by 2021 and digitalize about 80% of government-related transactions. Additionally, there are two priority sectors for rapid digitalization: health and education. Only 40% of Ecuador's 12,000 educational establishments are connected, while only 60% of its about 12,000 health centers and hospitals are connected to the internet. Bringing connectivity to these two sectors will create demand for the newly allocated spectrum and boost online education and telemedicine.</p><h4>Given the planned allocations of spectrum, how is competition expected to evolve among telecom operators in the country?</h4><p>As we open the spectrum, companies already operating in the market and newcomers will be interested in buying. It is difficult to have more competitors when there are already three in a relatively small country like Ecuador; however, there may be strategic alliances to meet certain needs of the telephone companies in connectivity, internet, voice, data, or deployment. We are facilitating the return on investment with certain legal reforms, and the concessions being made are longer-term. We have started talks with operators such as AT&amp;T and Virgin Mobile to see if they are interested in entering Ecuador. At the same time, the state-owned operator, CNT, will be managed privately, although its assets will remain property of the Ecuadorian state. With privatization, CNT will increase its competitiveness, and thus raise competition standards in the country and improve customer service.</p><h4>How does the ministry help the private sector in the digitalization of its operations?</h4><p>Part of the creation of an e-government platform is to build paths for efficient business transactions, such as the setup of a company. Moreover, there are sectors where technology can boost productivity, such as agriculture. Ecuador is an excellent agricultural country, and it has several sub-sectors that need access to connectivity. We have several projects in segments such as shrimp and livestock, where IoT is driving efficiency in production. We are also working on the formalization of e-commerce. We are implementing a national e-commerce strategy with a payment gateway through Ecuador's banking system.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Ecuador's performance in terms of its tourism sector's competitiveness?</h4><p>Ecuador's score on the 2019 Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report by the World Economic Forum is 3.9, a result that it has maintained since 2016. There is currently a different method of measurement, and lately more countries have been added to the assessment, which is why we have fallen in the ranking from 56th place to 70th. However, the scoring remains the same and is aligned with the average of Latin America countries. Ecuador's main advantages on this ranking are its international openness in terms of visa facilitation and bilateral air service agreements, as well as its price competitiveness and environmental sustainability.</p><h4>Which international markets are you focusing your efforts on to boost tourist arrivals?</h4><p>Our strategy sets out a list of priority markets, which are the US and the main European markets namely the UK, Germany, France, and Spain. The Spanish market registered an important increase in terms of arrivals. In 2018, we exceeded 100,000 Spanish tourists, a 75% increase from 2017. This was due to the efforts by Ecuador to improve connectivity, which was welcomed by Spanish airlines. We have now three Spanish airlines with direct flights to Quito and Guayaquil: Iberia, Plus Ultra, and Air Europa. In general, connectivity is one of the main drivers for tourism, which is why we are focused on improving it. In May 2019, the first Air France flight to Ecuador resumed after 25 years. Now, Air France operates three flights per week. The Brazilian Gol Airlines also started operations recently, while LATAM Airlines now connects Santiago de Chile and Quito, further improving our regional connectivity. Longer flights are now being developed or expanded in terms of frequencies by airlines such as Interjet, American Airlines, and Air Canada, operating flights from Mexico, Dallas, and Toronto, respectively. We hope that direct flights will soon be established with other main markets in Europe, such as the UK and Germany.</p><h4>What is the potential of offering a tourism experience jointly with Colombia or Peru, especially for long-distance tourists?</h4><p>Long-haul flights are needed to penetrate the huge Asian market; however, we also need to provide more comprehensive regional packages. These tourists don't come only to visit one country in Latin America. That is why we are working alongside Peru and Colombia to provide a comprehensive offering and create initiatives that would include a visit to Peru's Machu Picchu, Ecuador's Galápagos, and Colombia's Bogotá or Cartagena in a single package, for example.</p><h4>What are the main priorities for Ecuador's tourism strategy in the short term?</h4><p>Our main priority now is connectivity, though the second goal is to ensure that tourists stay in Ecuador longer. Right now, tourists in Ecuador saty an average of 1.5 nights per city. We want to increase those figures, and to achieve that, it is important to work more closely with tour operators and improve our tourism offer. Then the next step is to ensure tourists spend more while visiting Ecuador to increase tourism revenue, which is related to the range of activities and additional offerings. This is something that our ministry is working on. The goal is for tourism to become Ecuador's second-most important magnet of foreign currency after non-renewable resources. We need to significantly increase the figure of 1.5 million tourists per year to achieve this goal.</p><h4>The tourism sector needs investments to become more competitive and attractive. What steps are being taken in this regard?</h4><p>A new legislation for tourism is being worked out to ensure this activity becomes stable and advances its status as a state policy. Ecuador currently offers many investment opportunities to foreign investors, and one of the sectors where incentives can be used for a longer period of time is tourism. For example, in the Andes, we have 'Pueblos Mágicos,' a strategy to promote tourism in small towns. These towns are opening their doors to tourism investments to create infrastructure and quality offerings for international visitors. Additionally, Ecuador is promoting itself as a premium and sustainable destination. Ecuador's four worlds—the Galápagos Islands, the coast, the Andes, and the Amazon—are the perfect destinations for foreign investment in all tourism fields, mainly in sustainable and socially responsible projects. Under the program Invest Ecuador Tourism, we have created a whole range of investment opportunities for international investors. Soon after the launch, we agreed on four contracts totaling USD133.4 million in investments.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over 1,000 towers in Nigeria and Ghana]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[wole-abu-ceo-pan-african-towers]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you leading change and enabling companies to achieve their potential?</h4><p>This IT sector empowers the digital platform, which is crucial because infrastructure shortage in Sub-Saharan Africa is an issue. Over the past five years, mobile network operators (MNOs) have spent about USD40 billion in capex investment on 3G and 4G infrastructure across sub-Saharan Africa. At present, 54% of total mobile connections are based on broadband because of the shift to data. This means that access to life-enhancing services such as education, health, and finance has increased. Nigeria ranks among the bottom 20 countries in the Global Competitive Index, which goes on to show the need for quality infrastructure; that is where we come in.<br> </p><h4>Do you think the ICT infrastructure gap is still large in Nigeria?</h4><p>It is a mixed bag. Private capital and government spending are typically not complementing each other optimally. There are places where private capital has seen an opportunity and gone way ahead of government, like in Lagos. In other places, you see government spending taking the lead. Governments in Africa traditionally tend to favor state involvement in large projects. Nigerian telecoms were in government hands until 20 years ago, when the Nigerian Communication Commission opened it up to private investment. That for me is the story of how governments should really collaborate with private players. I think something as simple as roads should also be built by private players as the gap cannot be filled by the public sector. We are in the age of the fourth industrial revolution, which is being driven by digital platforms. A town or village with no communication will change after three years as businesses go digital. Education, health, and financial inclusion are key to any country's development. Sub-Saharan Africa has made slow progress on these in the past, but we can catch up in the near future by using industry 4.0 technologies.</p><h4> <br>How do the MNOs cope with the insufficient infrastructure?</h4><p>They build it themselves. That is how it was in Nigeria before the privatization. If one operator does not have the regulatory framework or infrastructure, it partners with the one that has everything in place. Tenancy rates is a key metric for tower companies, which is why a tower is shared by multiple operators. This way, MNOs can also reduce their overall capex investment in infrastructure.<br> </p><h4>What is your financial engineering strategy?</h4><p>We are keen on localizing our debt to avoid exchange rate risks, attracting long term capital that suits the nature of our business and patient capital from private equity firms. In terms of funding, the Nigeria Infrastructure Debt Fund is funding us with long-term debt that we use to roll out infrastructure. We are also working with other financial institutions to raise a long-term bond to support our other growth aspirations.<br> </p><h4>What would you say is your company's achievements since its inception?</h4><p>Pan African Towers is a new telecommunications infrastructure and a wireless service facilitator that entered the African market in 2018 and, since then, has succeeded in growing its portfolio size to slightly over 1,000 towers in Nigeria and Ghana. We have attained enviable records in our power availability, mean time to restore sites and site deployment times.  We have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by deploying renewable energy at our sites . The sustainability of the environment matters to us and we have invested heavily to preserve it while doing business. In recognition of our efforts, we were awarded the Nigerian Tech and Innovation Technology Award (NTITA) as the Emerging Tower Company of the Year, and also received the Leading Telecommunication Service Provider of the Year 2019 Award at the International Standard Leadership Award organized by the Quality World Alliance. These awards were given to commemorate our contribution to the growth and development of the telecommunication sector in Nigeria. We are young, but Africa has lot of opportunities to explore especially regarding telecommunications. We are just doing our best to provide connectivity in Africa using the best technology while also thinking about the environment.<br> </p><h4>Where do you see your company in five years?</h4><p>Pan African Towers African footprint will definitely expand to other countries, where we see opportunities. We would become a major driving force for deployment and integration of new models in Small Cell, Fiber and rural coverage.  At Pan African Towers, we have an aggressive growth plan to deploy 35,000 towers in five years; leveraging cutting-edge technology and a unique business model that offers unparalleled value to mobile network operators, internet service providers and the customers by extension, ensuring that there is broadband coverage across Africa. With 4G network receiving about 50% deployment across Africa, in five years our towers will be fully positioned to integrate the 5G technology, which will create more opportunities for MNOs and ISPs.</p><h4> <br>How do you plan to fund your growth going forward? Are you looking abroad to attract investors?</h4><p>Yes, we are discussing with global institutional investors and have concluded plans to inject more equity into the business. We also have secured long term debt funding to support our growth aspirations. Our investors are very happy with our growth trajectory and performance so far and are happy to support us as we continue the rollout of critical telecommunication infrastructure across Africa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Invima seek to reduce waiting times and procedures in the medical sector through technology?</h4><p>Digital transformation is also a tool to fight corruption, to be more transparent and efficient. Part of that digital transformation affects our six regional offices. As a result of digital transformation and a restructuring of all these regional offices, we seek to ensure these valuable entrepreneurs in the regions can access the sanitary registry through tools. Additionally, we need to generate alliances with the academy and other state institutions such as chambers of commerce. Hence, we are working in all regions doing workshops to build the health status. They consist of training people because we have valuable entrepreneurs in several regions of the country with wonderful business plans, though they have no knowledge of the relevance that complying with sanitary standards has on public health.</p><h4>How does Invima plan to continue increasing scientific rigor and vigilance, particularly in the field of medical and cosmetic cannabis?</h4><p>Invima does not have the nature of promoting entrepreneurship, economic development, or anything similar. Invima is a health authority, though health interests do not have to collide with business interests. Many times they can be reconciled when the interests are legitimate, and we agree on the purpose of promoting public health. In this government, we have a clear and defined policy regarding the use of medical cannabis. We respect the autonomy of nations that have accepted the use of recreational cannabis, though in Colombia, the use of cannabis is restricted to medicinal use. That does not prevent us from moving forward, for example, in something that the industry demands. In fact, we have already done it in the cosmetics sector, where there are more than 300 health records. Compared to other countries, such as Canada, Colombia has made great efforts. There are certain business developments that we cannot ignore as long as we have a single roadmap based on scientific rigor. With science, we can define specific uses and a timely development of cannabis around the needs in the world of medicine, for example, pain and inflammation, insomnia, anxiety, muscle spasticity in some specific diseases, issues of refractory epilepsy in specific syndromes, and so on. Colombia must hold on to scientific rigor to boost that industry. The country is a pioneer in regulatory matters in the region. People perceive Invima as one of the most problematic organizations, but I want to ensure serious quality standards of safety and efficacy, in order to strengthen public health which is my primary purpose. Though when the industrial and business interest are legitimate it doesn't have lo clash with health interest.</p><h4>How is Invima facilitating the success of the medical cannabis business, and what are your short and medium-term expectations about its role in the face of a rapidly developing market?</h4><p>I only see Invima in its role as health authority. Moreover, we have a standard that has advanced and cannot be stagnant. Colombia has to move ahead in issuing excellent manufacturing practices to make the market for master products a reality. Also, we have to keep moving forward so that there is more transformation, more physiotherapeutic products, so that there are more products based on chemical synthesis, but all done with scientific rigor. There are many instances of the government seeing how to promote this without neglecting public health interests.</p><h4>How does Colombia stand in comparison to the region in terms of medical cannabis? </h4><p>I see Invima focused on health issues, quality, safety, efficiency, and good manufacturing practices, so that products can access international markets. However, there is a road traveled by investors already settled in the medical cannabis industry. A large part of the establishments I visited in Canada are from investors present in Colombia, so there is transparency of knowledge and technology that gives us peace of mind as a health authority. When one sees the developments of many of those industries in Colombia, they realize many industries are allied with those that already have an important path. That gives us peace of mind in health matters. The rigor I saw in Canada around production is extremely high.</p><h4>As one the most important authorities in Colombia, what is your outlook for the 2020?  </h4><p>Essentially, we seek to build prestige. To have prestige, society must recognize it. We are the health authority that promotes and protects the public's health through the surveillance of a universe of very important products that people use and consume on daily basis. This recognition is the most important and is achieved through transparency, efficiency, and hygienic conditions. We have advanced significantly in the area of food, cosmetics and medical devices. We have facilitated procedures and eliminated some. The pharmaceutical issue has cost us greatly. It has been more difficult to move forward. It will take us more time but we will do it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us a short briefing on the role that creative industries play in the Colombian economy today?</h4><p>A strategy the government seeks to develop is taking advantage of one of the most important assets we have as a country: our human talent. Colombia has the second-youngest population in Latin America and there is a great deal of entrepreneurial spirit here. President Duque has been developing and encouraging the orange economy, and there is a perfect match with the idea of creative economy. Creative economy icludes those economic sectors traditionally related to human talent and culture that now deliver more added value based on creativity and innovation. In Colombia, that represents around 1.8% of our GDP. However, in countries like the UK and the Netherlands, that participation is close to 10%. Our goal is to move from 1.8% and double that figure or even get close to a 5% contribution to GDP. To reach that level of participation, we need to strengthen our institutions, boost the country's industry and ensure that we have an inclusive sector that develops and supports inspiration, one that has actions focused on building this kind of culture and mentality in our field. We want to develop more incentives such as a zero-percentage income tax rate for the next seven years for our sector. We are also extending existing incentives, for example, we are going to improve the production of not only films, but also television series, videos, and other media related to the creative economy. Today, this sector, which includes music, arts, theater, architecture, design, audio-visual, games, and so on, is becoming a relevant sector for the country's future. It may not be the most important one, but it will be quite relevant and strategic. Currently, economic activities directly related to the cultural and creative industries generate about 1.1 million jobs; ProColombia, for example, has facilitated export business to 176 orange entrepreneurs from 13 departments towards 50 countries; Foreign direct investment in orange economy projects was estimated at USD 1.093 in the last year. Additionally, entities such as Artesaní­as de Colombia have supported more than 14.900 artisans in 300 municipalities of the country through technical assistance and production promotion programs, generating income for more than 10MM, while the Vice Ministry of Tourism has more USD10.600 millones de pesos to strengthen the sector of cultural tourism, infrastructure and technical training in all departments of the country. This is how the Government of President Duque wants to position the orange economy not simply as a trend, but as an alternative model of development for Colombians, especially at the regional level, understanding the creative and cultural vocation of each territory. Colombia is the first Spanish-speaking country with a “Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution“. This Center seeks to support the construction of policy frameworks so that Colombia and Latin America can undertake a technological transformation, marked by public, private, social and academic collaboration. The Center supports, advises and formulates policies for the management, development and implementation of 4.0 technologies. It has three areas of work: internet of things, artificial intelligence and blockchain.</p><h4>What benefits will be created with the Sustainable Trade Program that the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism has just agreed with the EU?</h4><p>The main actor in this process is the Ministry of Culture through the Vice-Ministry of Creativity. Our role is to provide the infrastructure and especially financial access. This is why we issued orange bonds over the last year to attract investment from around the world from different institutions to have enough money to offer a generous amount of loans for the sector. We issued bonds of almost USD150 million and those are already fully subscribed. The sector is taking advantage of this amount of money and using it for its own future as a sector. We did not think we would use all those funds so quickly, but we did, which means the economy has responded. We also believe the creative economy is a great opportunity to increase Colombia's export services. Over the last four years, the export services from Colombia has had reached an almost double-digit growth. Growing our exports is a must for the country over the coming years. This is why in March 2020, we will launch a new program funded by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) where we will develop policies, strategies, and tactics to increase service exports, including widely the orange economy. We are also working with the EU on cooperation methods to develop the creative economy concept. There are many strategies at the same time to grow the sector over the coming years.</p><h4>What is the ministry's position on moving through the process and becoming part of the OECD?</h4><p>We are committed to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the internal work that we must get done is mostly about strengthening our institutionality, in order to seek a position for Colombia as an active member. Since before being accepted as members of the Organization, we have been working on necessary internal adjustments to be able to reach the required international standards, which we will undoubtedly continue to improve with our full admission to this exclusive group of countries. It is the scenario in which the country can measure and compare itself with its peers, evaluate its context and accurately identify the fields were we can improve, promoting public policies that meet high standards and that leads us to improve transparency in every single action we take, a flagship crusade in Colombia. All these efforts probably will result in more equity, more employment and better quality of life for citizens. Compliance and "vigilance" of these standards creates certainty and predictability for productive sectors, investors and in the work of public officials. The active participation of the country in the OECD will allow for greater work spaces and for solving joint problems with other members, which are currently Colombia's main trading partners. In particular, as a full member of the organization, you can use your resources and participate in different discussions to constantly evaluate and improve the country's public policies, this to meet your challenges and achieve faster the country's goals. This is expected to influence the quality of government action and it is a way to contribute country's adequate development. An additional benefit of being part of the OECD, is that having passed the access filters, immediately it verifies a minimum of institutional strength. This is valued, for example, by an important group of institutional investors that limit their investments only to 'OECD countries', which impacts not only on attracting capital to the country but also on the cost of financing (due to its perceived risk reduction effect).</p><h4>You have traveled extensively around Colombia's regions talking to the people about the ministry's policies and the president's proposed projects. What has been the impact of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Tourism's regional networking?</h4><p>Colombia is a country of regions, so we do need to be present in all of them. People want to be more competitive, and the only way to do this is by developing competitiveness in each of the country's regions. It is not feasible to foster growth just in one region or city, while the others do not develop correctly. But how can we show that this approach works? Firstly, Colombia has one of the highest growth rates in Latin America today at 3.05%. Our growth rate could be first or second in Latin America and far above other countries with which we compete. This means something is changing in this country and that the productive sector apparatus is moving, not only in Bogota, but in every region of Colombia. For example, the Caribbean region is growing by 5-6%, making it one of the biggest engines of Colombian growth. In addition, the interest from global investors is increasing, with FDI growing at higher than 24%, which means the country is becoming an attractive one, and not only because of its main cities, but also our regions. There is investment in energy, infrastructure, IT, industry, tourism, and agroindustry, and in different sectors of the economy in diverse regions of Colombia. It is not only in the numbers; from my interaction with people in the regions, I can see they are finding new opportunities. Going to the regions is not only a way to attract investment and grow more, but also to see how we can take advantage of the particular resources different regions have, such as an industrial, tourism, or agricultural base. It is a way to grow faster and allow people to see how they can be part of this new process of growth in the country. For the regions, we have also been working on the Integrated Competitiveness and Innovation Agendas, which are constituted as socio-economic and competitive development routes for the regions. We currently have nine: Quindí­o, Chocó, Nariño, Boyacá, Huila, Casanare, Bolí­var, Guajira and Córdoba. This Project has got the Confecámaras support based on a methodological design of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. There are 278 programs, projects and initiatives prioritized.</p><h4>Tourism has increased by 50% over the past five years in Colombia. What are the tourism ministry (Viceministry) strategies and objectives and its general goals for 2020?</h4><p>Through our Sectoral Tourism Plan, we are working on improving the competitiveness of our country as a desirable tourist destination. We are strengthening our productivity, generating value and co-responsibility among actors in the tourism sector, as well we are continuously working on positioning Colombia in national and international markets. Our strategy is focused on increasing formalization throughout the tourism businesses and that they provide quality services in destinations. The latter via training and supporting regional entities. We established what we can call a “Formalization Council“, were we are able to identify and propose concrete and measurable actions, in order to solve the issues in the sector and increase the tourism businesses formalization, generating fair rules for different actors and interest groups pertaining to the tourism value chain. The result of our hand in hand work with territorial entities can be confirmed by the positive numbers and the adequate development they are showing. Nowadays, our main challenge remains in improving the positioning of our destinations in national and international markets, but, we are sure we are walking the right path, we are making tourism the “New Petroleum of Colombia.“ By 2020, our goal is to close the year with more than 4.9 million non-resident visitors and with a lot more sustainable destinations to offer our tourists. These destinations should have excellent practices in the environmental, socio-cultural and economic dimensions, as these requirements help destinations to be much more responsible. As well, it gives them recognition, helping them to improve the economic development of the region and, at the same time, generating new opportunities for the competitiveness of the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Telefónica's presence in Ecuador expanding in support of the digitalization of the country's economy?</h4><p>Telefónica has bet on Ecuador, and as a result, we continue to make investments of about USD150 million annually in network growth and digital services development. Based on our experience in several countries, we show the local business community how to be cost efficienct and improve their profitability and productivity through our digital services. In this regard, we have diversified our portfolio by moving from being just a telecoms provider to an enabler of digitalization in Ecuador. Companies are looking for ways to be more cost and expense effective and seeking to invest more in capital expenditures instead of operating expenses. In this scenario, Teléfonica, for example, offers its digital portfolio through monthly payments. We divide this portfolio into five verticals addressed at satisfying specific corporate needs such as security and information, cloud services, IoT, digital advertising, and information from heat maps.</p><h4>How are Telefónica's digital solutions used to support the development of Ecuador's strategic sectors?</h4><p>Our solutions can be applied across all sectors of the economy. In the agricultural sector, Ecuador's biggest exporting sector after oil, we bring solutions to the local market for livestock control to help track the location of animals and even determine if an animal leaves a virtual fence via radio-frequency identification (RFID). We have also started to use heat maps to determine the best locations for cashiers, new stores, POS, and even metro stations. Telefónica is proud to have worked in Quito's metro network project to help the municipality decide the most optimal locations. These tools allow one to decide how to transform digitally. On top of that, Teléfonica's location, EcoPark, is an extraordinary example of what can be achieved through digitalization. The entire complex is digitally monitored, and we have walked hand in hand with most of the companies or entities with locations in Ecuador such as Produbanco, Nestlé, Avianca, the UN, and Chubb to help them embrace the digital era.</p><h4>How will expenditure on IT evolve in the short term from both a public and private perspective?</h4><p>Corporations are quick to see the need of digitizing in order for their operations and services to be competitive. In the public arena, the opportunity in the government to digitalize is immense. We have worked with the public administration at different levels on several projects, one of them being Quito's metro network. Tourism is also a strategic sector for Ecuador, and we are working with the Ministry of Tourism to take advantage of tourism-related big data. We are gathering data on how many foreigners enter Ecuador, where they go, how they move, and where they stay, which are all useful not only for the Ministry of Tourism to determine its policies, but for all stakeholders in the sector. Our services are also being used by the national transit agencies to track mobility trends, which is useful in the area of road deployment or traffic management. The country's administration is moving toward an e-administration or e-government, though the pace should be quicker in order to catch up with international and regional trends. Nevertheless, the advantage of Ecuador is that it has similar characteristics to countries that develop rapidly, and its relatively small size makes it manageable and easy to roll out solutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What achievements have been made under your watch in the first 100 days as the helmsman at the FIRS?</h4><p>We have achieved a lot since we came on board. We had the daunting task of piecing together the pieces. This is not an easy task considering the fact that FIRS is a large organisation with about 10,000 staff and I am new to both the environment and the staff. In addition to this, some of the e-platforms on which the operations of the Service depend have one issue or the other which required fixing. So far, we've been able to cobble together the structure and fixed some e-platforms and introduced automation solutions to drive the revenue collection process.  Since my appointment, we have been trying to rebuild the system and the confidence of the staff in the operations of the Service. In addition to all these, we have fast tracked the issuance of TCCs through the window we provided in January. We also lifted the lien placed on taxpayers Bank accounts by the erstwhile management. These are all geared towards easing payment of taxes as well as creating conducive environment for ease of doing business. We have also put measures in motion to introduce other e-platforms as a way of ensuring efficient service delivery. In line with this too we have opened new audit offices,  segmented tax returns filing,  organized stakeholder sensitization programs.  So we're doing a lot of groundwork to improve our collections in the coming months.</p><h4>The Federal Government has set a tax collection target of N8.5tn for the Federal Inland Revenue Service in the 2020 fiscal period. What measures are you carrying out to restructure operations in order to meet this target and reduce the budget deficit?</h4><p>We are determined to meet this target to help the three tiers of government fund their 2020 budgets. We will scale the huddles by doubling up our efforts to collect all taxes due to the Federal Government even though we are aware that the Purchasing Parity of Nigerians is dwindling right now and that people are generally reluctant to pay taxes. The tax culture in Nigeria at the moment is not encouraging. We are going to work on that too as we move along. We will apply some level of diligence in collecting taxes particularly indirect taxes like VAT and the Stamp Duty which the Finance Act 2019 gives us the right to collect. Through this, we are confident that FIRS would be able to generate enough revenue for the government to fund its 2020 budgetary provisions (particularly the budget deficit) and make good its promise of providing key infrastructures, social amenities, fight insecurity, and stop further borrowing.</p><h4>The Finance Act 2019 was signed into law and came into operation on February 1, 2020. What benefits does the Finance Act offer to the individual taxpayer and businesses in terms of tariffs or tax palliatives?</h4><p>The Finance Act is an instrument that is meant to strengthen taxation system in Nigeria and that it is not yet a perfect document. Having said that, the Act contains a number of important palliatives especially for the small businesses. One of these is the exemption of companies whose turnover is less than N25 million from payment of Company Income Tax but they must file tax returns. Also, the Act stipulates a reduced Company Income tax of 20% for companies whose turnover is from N25 million to N100 million. Again, the Act provides that early payment of tax attracts a bonus of 2% of tax payable for medium size companies and 1% for bigger companies. Minimum tax computation has also been amended to 0.5% of gross turnover. And bank transfer of N10000 and above is now to attract stamp duty.</p><h4>While there has been a certain level of misunderstanding with regards to Stamp Duties in the past, could you provide us with a background and your view on the importance of Stamp Duties to the Nation?</h4><p>Stamp Duty relates to matters executed between a company and an individual, group or body of individuals. It is a tax on legal documents, deeds of agreements and contracts, electronic transfers, and electronic receipts on transactions in the region of N10,000 and above or transfers in like sum from one Current Account to another Current Account. The position of the law on Stamp Duty as at today is that it is the responsibility of the FIRS to collect Stamp Duty on behalf of the Federal Government. Since 1939 the Federal Board of Inland Revenue (FBIR), which transformed to FIRS in 1958, had been collecting stamp duty. Similarly, the recently gazetted Finance Act 2019 has amended s.4(1) of the Stamp Duty Act contained in S.(8) of the Law of the Federation of Nigeria 2004 to give the FIRS the sole right of collecting Stamp Duty on behalf of the Federal Government. Therefore, the Stamp Duty is one key tax we intend  to focus on going  forward. We are going to be diligent in collecting Stamp Duty as applicable under extant laws. We are very determined to make sure that all collecting agents of Stamp Duty, that  is, the Money Deposit Banks and  MDAs, remit it promptly to the FIRS account with the Central Bank. In addition, the collection of Stamp duties is of high importance since we are upbeat that revenue collection from it can rescue the economy from a possible downward slide. It has the potential to yield tax revenue in trillions of naira.  Presently, there are claims from many quarters that if the records of stamp duty on chargeable transactions as far back as the year 2000 are revisited as much as N20 trillion unremitted stamp duty revenue are due from agencies charged with collecting it on behalf of the Federal Government. This is more than double the year 2020 budget of the Federal Government. Again, from the initial analysis carried out by us regarding chargeable transactions in the banking sector, we discovered that in 2019 alone the total volume of transactions was over N52 billion. And that the total value of these transactions was over N613 trillion. We are currently carrying out analysis of these transactions to determine the actual chargeable transaction.</p><h4>Given that the FIRS has the sole right to collect the Stamp Duty, what measures are you carrying out to harness the potential that it has on revenue generation at the FIRS?</h4><p>We have commenced solid arrangements to make Stamp Duty the goose that lays the golden egg for the Federal Government in order to shore up its revenue base. To achieve this, I recently met with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of banks in Lagos to enlist their support to achieve 100% compliance in stamp duty collection through the use of automation solutions now being rolled out by FIRS. At present, we are working with relevant stakeholders to develop a workable remittance solution that will effectively block leakages and bring in more stamp duty revenue to the government. In due course, we would be deploying cutting-edge technology to drive the process of Stamp Duty collection. Relevant bodies and stakeholders have already been put on notice to support and comply with the process that we have put in place to actualize this objective. Every stakeholder is urged to be fully prepared and ready to adopt the new compliance program we are rolling out. With this, I can say without mincing words that the Federal Government did not make any mistake in entrusting stamp duty collection to the FIRS. In the months and years to come this capacity would be demonstrated in the use of the Stamp Duty as a flagship tax to rescue the economy from the looming downward slide.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Would you give us some background to the origins of Luxury Villas Group?</h4><p>Luxury Villas Group is a premier real estate agency and marketing company. I started the company as a luxury brand that markets upscale properties with choice addresses. We started in Lagos on the mainland, then moved to the islands, where you tend to have a higher concentration of the high-end brands.</p><h4>Who are Luxury Villas Group's clients, and what projects have you been involved in recently?</h4><p>We are presently selling properties in Azuri Towers on Azuri Peninsula and at Eko Atlantic. We are also the agents marketing 4 Bourdillon, a new 25-story development in Ikoyi, and we have had a high degree of interest in that. We work with top construction companies that build luxury projects. For example, we recently finished an apartment project on Banana Island with properties ranging from USD1.2 million-1.5 million. We have also worked with the family of Premier Loto on some amazing houses. There are hardly any luxury real estate developers that we do not work with. We are marketing a unique 500,000-sqm project at Beach Front Estate, which is purely a residential community. Because they are more expensive, the return on beach front investments is way better than one has with traditional developments.</p><h4>In terms of percentage, how many of Luxury Villas Group's clients are individuals versus corporations?</h4><p>We work more with individuals. The split is probably about 70% individual to 30% corporate clients.</p><h4>What competitive advantages differentiate Luxury Villas Group from its competitors in Nigeria?</h4><p>We are professional and honest about how we do business. We do not cut corners because integrity is part of our creed. As a realtor, your clients should be able to trust you; our clients have confidence in how we handle their funds, no matter the amounts involved. We do research as well; we are not just agents in the market. Our advisory work goes a long way. We can advise clients about which locations and zones to buy into, not based on hype, but on where you should put your money to get the best return on your investment.</p><h4>Regarding your facilities management arm, how successful has the security company been for the group?</h4><p>Our facilities and property management services and our agency services are currently most in demand. Some 80% of our business centers around agency; the next biggest area is property and facilities management. Corporate guards are an integral aspect of facilities management. You cannot manage a facility without having security in mind. This is not to say there are no good corporate security guards out there, but we believe in the uniqueness of how we conduct our business. The corporate guards we see at properties do not meet our standards. Therefore, we decided to create our own corporate guard service strictly for the properties we manage.</p><h4>How has the real estate market changed since 2016?</h4><p>Real estate is dynamic. For quite some time, the Nigerian economy was booming because of oil. That is the economic mainstay of the government. However, lately, the oil industry has not been doing quite so well for obvious reasons. Still, the situation has really improved with the peace in the Niger Delta, and there are foreign investors investing around Lagos in places such as Eko Atlantic City, Alaro City, and Banana Island. Most projects are actually for investors. There is a lot taking place in the real estate and development sector. There has been a huge improvement because of property development company Rendeavour coming into the market. The company started participating in developments in Kenya, then the DRC, before moving to Nigeria. The satellite city development project Rendeavour is doing in Lekki covers 1,000ha. Plus, there are foreign investors from the UAE involved in the Centenary City Abuja project. Real estate in Nigeria, especially in Lagos, is more profitable than in most countries in the world.</p><h4>Do you think satellite cities will be the future landscape for Nigeria?</h4><p>Yes, definitely. Alaro City, for example, is a city designed for work, play, and rest. Luxury Villas Group was the first company to buy into Alaro City. That corridor is the future Lagos. There are major petrochemical industry projects, along with a refinery, there. There is also a major road—the Coastal Road—that Lagos state government is going to extend from Eko Atlantic to the Lagos Free Trade Zone, possibly in partnership with the federal government. Whether ones likes it or not, we are going to be gradually migrating toward that axis. We also have the airport coming there and seaports too. Lagos state in particular is trying to reduce congestion in the old central business district. Victoria Island is becoming a new business district. The city has expanded with the continued influx of people from other cities into Lagos because Lagos is the economic and commercial hub of Nigeria. So, these satellite cities will be the future.</p><h4>What are your key priorities at Luxury Villas Group for 2020?</h4><p>We have made our mark in Lagos' luxury market. As such, we are putting together a business plan for the presence we want to have in Dubai. Locally, we are concentrating on sales for Azuri Towers, which has 10 floors of apartments, and we are one of the lead agents. I love that project because it is right on the marina and you can use the canals to connect with any part of the island. There are also helipads. Eko Atlantic is a city within a city and is the most upscale project so far—it is the Manhattan of Nigeria. My focus for 2020 is to sell as many properties as possible at Eko Atlantic; we have sold quite a few already.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your competitive advantage, and how do you manage your loyal customer base?</h4><p>Cadbury, Nestlé, Unilever, Nigerian Breweries, and Guinness are our core customers. It involves doing what you say you will do and not changing contract terms in the middle. We were able to ask our core clients on a weekly basis their raw material requirement and adjust production to fit their needs. They do not need to carry a huge stock, as a huge stock means tying down money. We are also able to tell them a single price for a consignment. Therefore, we might import and store their products in the short term; in some cases, clients want product delivered immediately, but in other cases, we have developed an arrangement where we keep the stock and deliver on a just-on-time basis, taking into account the financing and delivery costs. We have over a hundred trailers. Our competitive advantage is we carry out every delivery requested. We have many professionals in the business. As the business was developing and growing, we brought in experts from different areas; I just tell every single one to deliver on promises that we have made. In 2014, we were one of the 100 big businesses in Nigeria.</p><h4>How has the closure of land boarders affected JOF and the logistics service provider industry nationwide?</h4><p>Up until the border closure, we were taking finished products from Unilever Nigeria to Unilever in Ghana, as Unilever is seen as one company and Nestle is seen as one company. We would bring stock from these companies via road, and they would sell to their sister companies. Furthermore, we also brought the products they produce abroad that they sell here. If there are raw material issues, we will bring raw materials from their sister company or from other manufacturers or suppliers within ECOWAS, including Ghana and Benin. We are aware that there are many things coming into Nigeria for which no duty was being paid. This smuggling is why the federal government shut down the border. We work with most national companies, and we pay the full duty for whatever we are bringing in. In exports, we ensure the other party pays the duty at their end. As the border is closed, these goods cannot go by road anymore, but they can still go by sea freight. This process is a bit complicated, as the sea route to West Africa is not well developed. If you want to use international freight liners or large shipping companies to export goods from Nigeria, unfortunately products go from West African countries, and then Europe, before they reach Nigeria. So, if you are sending goods from Nigeria to Ghana on Maersk line, the goods will first go to Europe before coming to West African. It is complicated and there are many costs associated with it.</p><h4>What opportunities for diversification has road deterioration in Nigeria offered JOF?</h4><p>For every problem there is a solution. Because of the road issues, we are using the train to move our cargo from the port. We have also been using barges on the waterways to move our cargo out of the port, which we have found to be effective. Due to this, we have a little port being developed where our barges can go, and, pending that, we use the Ikorudu light terminal for our barge operation. Hence, we bring in the goods by barge. Our trailers then go there, where they load the containers and take them to our clients' factories.</p><h4>How will this port reduce the time of the cargo transportation, and how much cargo can it support?</h4><p>It will be first and foremost for our clients, then we will open it to third and fourth parties to use. With this new port, the value we bring to our customers is that they do not have to clear their goods at the port. This was done because the process was taking too long and people were complaining. In terms of cargo support, we are looking for a space that can line up three different batches for discharge and can store up to 1,000 containers. We are supporting the operation we already do with the dry port, which is the container terminal and bonded warehouse that we have had since 2007.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for this year?</h4><p>We intend to complete the building of the small container mini port and terminal where there is a long jetty that can berth a few barges. They can put all their equipment there and offload onto the jetty. We can also make it into a bonded terminal so one does not have to clear the goods. Furthermore, there will be space for customs and other agencies to have their operations. It is a way of decongesting the port; thus, we are working with APMT to make this happen. Our clients have bought into this and are excited about it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What businesses and operations fall under Ranjy Construction and Foundation and what is the company's Unique Selling Point?<br></h4><p>RCF was founded in 2014 to carry out specialized works like geotechnical investigations, piling foundations and construction. In Nigeria, this expertise is only available in one or two companies. However, the key business differentiator between RCF and its competitors is a high level of domain knowledge coupled with local expertise and world renowned consultants who assist and advise in optimizing project design thereby reducing costs of between 20-30% which is passed on to the client.</p><h4>From which areas of business does RCF gain most of its demand?</h4><p>RCF commenced operations as a geotechnical investigations and pile foundations service provider but has today diversified into constructing complex structures like Jetties with both Roll-On/Roll-off and Lift-on/Lift-off capabilities, which includes quaysides and ramps capable to handle heavy project cargoes. The Jetty built by RCF, now called Dangote Quays Lekki, handled the world's heaviest single piece of steel in the Refining business: a 3,000 MTs single piece including its stool weight. In maintaining its long term vision of nurturing Nigerian companies, the President/CEO of the Dangote group Alhaji Aliko Dangote provided an opportunity to M/s. RCF to carry out, on a turnkey basis the design and construction of the RORO/ LOLO Jetty with a very high permissible load density on the structure so that some of the world's heaviest project cargoes for the Group's refining complex could be brought through this gateway. This was necessitated due to the absence of any such infrastructure elsewhere in Nigeria where the cargoes could be landed. When Dangote realized that this Jetty was inadequate to handle their cargo volumes and to further reduce their ship waiting time, thereby reducing demurrage costs, the management at the Dangote group once again invited RCF to construct and expand the current infrastructure by currently building a quay wall to handle additional two ships. This is a reflection of the trust and faith that the Dangote group has reposed in the management of RCF to deliver high quality port based infrastructure. We are once again thankful for their trust and faith in us, which has helped us catapult into an organization associated with building world class port-based infrastructure. Apart from above, RCF also executes design and construction of commercial and residential complexes with all the best-in-class amenities and a keen focus on maintaining high standards of quality.</p><h4>What major projects has RCF completed so far?</h4><p>RCF has built a 138m RORO/ LOLO Jetty for Dangote Oil Refinery. It is currently handling project cargoes and will later be used as a support base for auxiliary crafts and support vessels. Currently RCF is building the second Jetty for Dangote under the expansion program of which 50% has been completed and handed over to the client for commissioning trials. This Jetty, upon completion will be 440m long and will handle Supermax vessels for product offtakes and raw material imports. In addition, RCF is working on the prestigious Lagos Sky tower project. It is a high-end residential project expected to increase the construction standard in Nigeria. RCF aims to use the best-in-class quality materials and provide value added services including full-fledged automation, communication using fiber-optics, a rooftop swimming pool with a large lounge area, conference rooms, dining areas, a movie theatre, an adequately well-equipped gym and an open religious space. </p><h4>How do you envision the sectors in which you operate in within the next 10 years?</h4><p>Nigeria has a lot of potential for growth. The industrial sector is under-developed, and the economy is heavily dependent on importation. In this regard, the port sector represents an attractive opportunity to upscale the infrastructure by providing a boost to the Nigerian economy and by generating qualified employment opportunities for the Nigerian youth. The West African coastline, of about 4000 miles, extending from Mauritania to Cameroon, has a limited number of ports. The West African countries are being developed, and the population is growing. Therefore, Trade volume is increasing as well. As trade flourishes, we expect more ports to be developed or existing ones to be upgraded, since waterways have always been a primal mode of transportation. The above presents an exciting business opportunity to RCF group to hive on its strengths and provide viable cost-effective port-based infrastructures. In Nigeria many mega infrastructure projects are being planned which showcase a huge upside growth potential for our construction business.</p><h4>What are RCF's plans and key priorities for 2020?</h4><p>Our main focus is on real estate and infrastructure. At RCF, we believe construction and infrastructure are key drivers to boost the country's economy. We have long term objectives and strategy. We work actively on pursuing while focusing on our human capital. The last two years have been difficult on the global economy, but we have managed to overcome that with a reasonably full order book. We are hopeful that we will be in a better position next year and the following years. We are seeing a lot of progress. Our main target is to complete the two jetties for M/s. Dangote. This project is of national importance to Nigeria as the completion of the refinery will attract more foreign direct investment. This integrated petroleum and petrochemical complex will play a vital role in helping to reverse Nigeria's reliance on fuel imports and meet domestic demand by catapulting Nigeria from a fuel importer to a fuel exporter. And finally, we hope to complete the Lagos Sky tower project.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your planned goals and growth strategy for 2026?</h4><p>Our overall strategy at Walter Smith is to become an integrated energy company that makes a great socio-economic impact. In doing this, we will also ensure the longer term decarbonizing our energy portfolio. Another part of our strategy is to behave like an indigenous independent energy company and not like the typical an international oil &amp; gas company; which means we will not treat oil and gas as commodities for sale, but ensure we use them as 'feedstock' back in the economy of Nigeria to consume more of the energy produced and grow our GDP. That is where the socio-economic impact will come from. We currently operate one marginal field: the Ibigwe field in OML 16. We also have another interest in OML34 in Delta state, where we partner with other companies in what is known as the ND Western Consortium. Our current operational focus is the Ibigwe field, where we have grown production from an initial 500bpd to over 7,000bpd. The first part of our strategy was to convert the oil into consumable products through the refinery, for which the first phase of 5,000 bopd was kicked off in November 2018. For the next phase, we want to increase the refining capacity by 25,000 barrels of condensate per day in addition to kicking off a modular gas-to-power project. This power project will start with roughly 30MW of power and then grow to about 300MW to serve both the refineries and a planned industrial city. Ultimately, our goal is to build an industrial city around the Ibigwe location, where we would provide the infrastructure for other types of industry to come in. Some of the greatest challenges in Nigeria is the cost of doing business for manufacturers, principally around energy costs as well as the accessibility of export routes. Leveraging on some government policies the industrial city can help with easing some of these problems. Following the industrial park (we will create the infrastructure as a first stage - gas, power, water, ICT, security, health services and whatever else is required in a functional manufacturing area), we will build residential areas and both the internal road networks and a link road from to the major Port Harcourt — Owerri Expressway.</p><h4>What sources of power will you employ for the industrial park?</h4><p>We have entered into engagements with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) since it has a concept of eco industrial parks, and that is about decarbonizing the energy used in industrial parks. We have also started an internal concept about replacing the dirtier fossil fuels first with gas (so that oil and coal will be taken off the mix) and later with renewable sources of energy. Even though it is a fossil fuel, gas does to an extent help with decarbonizing the energy produced from fossil fuels; it is not perfect but is cleaner than other fossil fuels. Following that gas phase, we then want to move into solar power. We have strategized about the renewable mix, and solar power seems to be the most obvious one. The next phase of our business, after the industrial city, is to grow up to 500MW of solar power (and maybe as high as 1,000MW). <br>In all this, the concept is to demonstrate that an independent marginal field producer can build an industrial city on the back of such production, hoping then that if everyone with a marginal field license can replicate the same in the locality where they operate and create such socio-economic impact, then industrial cities will sprout up everywhere in Nigeria.</p><h4>With Walter Smith being an example of projects for the future of Nigeria, what would you recommend to other players in the field reproducing such master plans?</h4><p>One of the major constraints is around funding for the modular refineries. The technology is there, and the EPC contractors that we have are one of many, so it is not about the technology. The funding challenge is the ability (or inability) to demonstrate to funding parties that you have access to the feedstock as well as robustness of the demand for your refined products (the offtakers of the refined products). Each individual Refining company must also understand their financial model. Ours is about production security in the area where we operate and the economics of providing a refining solution to this challenge. The production in the area where we operate has security challenges from vandalism, and, hence, there are significant costs in producing each barrel of oil. On Government's enabling  policies, if the intent is clear that you actually want to refine crude oil or condensate, instead of getting access to feedstock for sale as a commodity, then our experience is that there are no real challenges or government policies that have hindered us from moving forward.</p><h4>The gas sector is experiencing some constraints. What can be done to stimulate this sector to its full potential?</h4><p>There are about five major areas that need to be addressed. First, we cannot have the same fiscal terms in place for all types of gas (dry gas to wet gas and independent of terrain). The fiscal policy must first address the type of gas and its location and ensure the provision of fiscals that enable a level playing field, especially taking into account operators of dry gas assets. Second, not all gas projects have an accompanying oil project from which an advantage can be derived through recovering gas investments from oil revenue (e.g. the associated gas framework agreement and any  similar framework for non-associated gas). This must be taken into consideration in the fiscal policy. Third, terrain is also important. In Nigeria, export gas typically attracts higher prices than domestic gas. It is therefore logical (again equitable) that the more expensive offshore gas to develop should be allocated to export and the cheaper onshore gas to develop is allocated to domestic use.  Gas swaps are therefore essential for already sanctioned or developed gas projects as we progress. Even within the domestic gas space, an 'aggregation' concept (the reason for setting up the Gas Aggregation Company of Nigeria — GACN) must be properly executed to allow the distribution of gas to power and industry that are only profitable if the unit costs of gas is low. Fourth, domestic gas pricing must quickly move from a regulated pricing mechanism to a 'willing buyer — willing seller' pricing mechanism and it must be clear how this transition will be effected. Fifth, Government has to build the required gas infrastructure to deliver domestic gas to the end users and the recent Ajaokuta-Kaduna-Kano (AKK) line is an example of the Government delivering on the needed infrastructure. Finally, by 'modularizing' the delivery of gas, to power and industry, through the creation of industrial parks / cities around the operational hub of oil and gas assets, significant growth in the generation, distribution, transmission and consumption of these resources will occur with the attendant GDP growth.</p><h4>What are your key priorities for 2020?</h4><p>For 2020, the key goals for Nigerian operations of Waltersmith are to commission the first phase of the refinery and start selling products. We then want to start off the second phase of the refinery, which includes our first module of gas to power. We want to make sure that by the end of the year we have made a final investment decision on the second phase of the refinery and the gas power projects. Other priorities include the purchase of the land for the industrial park  and starting the technical design work together with UNIDO and other technical parties. In addition, for our Equatorial Guinea operations and after the signing of the Block EG23 PSC, we will quickly mature the block to first oil within 24 months of FID on the first Appraisal/ Development phase. We also want to support the Nigeria 'Year of Gas' and the Equatorial Guinea 'Year of Investment' by working with Government to ensure the enabling environment for successful business investments is created.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The UAE has issued a new companies law and a bankruptcy law that most likely will boost entrepreneurship, the long awaited bankruptcy law comes with a preliminary protection and process to avoid and protect companies from bankruptcy to save companies that may be able to be saved from liquidity issues and court enforcements. Corporate registries in the UAE year on year are offering more competitive setting up and licensing fees and continually improve the friendliness and speed for setting up in the UAE.</p><h4>How do you and the company embody and enhance Dubai's spirit of innovation?</h4><p>We try to foster innovation by bringing minds to work together in particular when working on solving a problem. We try to make a challenge of everything we do in the office and encourage working groups to meet within the office to think of new ways and ideas to help improve our office. On an ongoing basis we try to re-think what we do in the office and speak out in a friendly forum of what we would like to see better in the firm, we then take such ideas and compare them against one another and put a group together to implement and make change in the organization. The ongoing nature of obtaining ideas and then comparing them to one another provides itself innovation and gives the people involved experience in dealing with new ideas and learning which ideas work and which do not through this experience.</p><h4>How do you expect Expo 2020 will impact the entrepreneurial and innovation landscape? How do you expect it to impact the firm's work in IP law and more broadly?</h4><p>We believe that EXPO 2020 will be a reminder to the country that there is a lot more room for innovation, it certainly will encourage people by seeing the pace of development and innovation in other countries. As a firm we expect to  assist new business or current businesses with new bright ideas and its implementation. We also expect a rise in work to do with the registration of patents and trademarks. There is a growing need as well for protecting authors of art and other productions which we have noticed in the recent years and this trend will continue as more work from authors are produced in this region. There is certainly a high probability that EXPO 2020 will encourage more innovation and growth in the business in the region as people from all over the world exchange ideas and learn new things from one another.</p><h4>How does Dubai compare in terms of IP Law and innovation regionally? Are there any places that offer notable competition now or in the near future?</h4><p>We believe that Dubai has led the region in innovation, the UAE has as well put in place extremely important IP laws very early to help this growth and protect any innovation and new ideas by any person in the UAE. IP is being protected in the UAE in a very noticeable fashion and the regulation is being enforced by the authorities diligently. The other seven emirates in particular Abu Dhabi are also enforcing and regulating the IP laws under the same federal law and regulation, each emirate in the UAE certainly can be seen to encourage innovation and new ideas in slightly different but successful ways.</p><h4>What are your strategic priorities and vision for the firm in 2020 and the coming years?</h4><p>The firm's priorities and vision for 2020 and the coming years is to focus on challenging businesses with new legal ideas to improve the protection that they are afforded by law, to assist in concluding successful contracts for clients of ours and to develop a better commercial understanding of the business and priorities of our clients to better serve them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Nigeria's leading security company, could you walk us through Pentagon Securities operations in Nigeria and the services that are most relevant in your portfolio?</h4><p>At Pentagon, we provide integrated security solutions for assets, facilities, industrial and residential complexes, ports/jetties, refineries, depots, plants, offices, warehouses, etc. Some of the most relevant services we provide include security architecture design and review, risk assessment, cyber security, security training, pipeline surveillance, provision of security vessels for offshore platforms, procurement/installation/maintenance of security equipment, provision of armed escorts for VIP protocol services, and provision of trained security officers.</p><h4>Rising insecurity in Nigeria has been a major concern in recent years, largely impacting the country's economy. How has this situation affected your clients, and how has it affected your organization? </h4><p>Our clients are mostly corporate entities such as IOCs, NOCs, multinationals, government MDAs (ministries, departments and agencies), banks, non-profit organizations, and high net-worth individuals. For those of our clients who have their assets/facilities within the Niger-Delta region or the North-East zone for instance, it has become more expensive for them to run their businesses due to the higher security costs and employee wages associated with the higher levels of insecurity in these areas. Several companies who could not bear the increased risks and associated costs were forced to relocate to other parts of the country, or even close down entirely. This has led to increased unemployment, increased youth restiveness, and reduced production in the places they once operated, ultimately reducing the GDP of Nigeria. The rising insecurity also made Pentagon Securities become more of an agile organization. We adapted to the changing landscape and expanded our service offerings to suit the newer needs of our clients. In some instances we started providing more frequent security assessments, briefings, and trainings to our clients as a value-added service, and also began advising on journey management plans. In other cases we helped clients redesign their security architecture and also procure more suitable security equipment like bulletproof vehicles, automated bollards, and drones for aerial surveillance.</p><h4>What role do Private Security Companies (PSCs) play with regards to the Government Security Forces in Nigeria, and what is their relationship?</h4><p>In Nigeria, Private Security Companies (PSCs) complement the efforts of Government Security Forces (GSFs) like the Nigerian Police Force, Army, Navy, as well as other military and paramilitary organizations in the safeguarding of human lives and property. Whereas officers of Private Security Companies do not bear arms or carry weapons, they serve as the first barrier of entry/exit and first line of defence at any station they occupy. In this capacity, they carry out roles related to access control, security surveillance and perimeter patrol around the lives and property they are protecting.  PSCs can also assist GSFs with intelligence gathering, especially in high-risk areas, and transmission of this intelligence to the appropriate channels for further action. For instance, at Pentagon we are able to leverage on our vast network of informants, our large number of employees, and our good knowledge of the local terrain, to gain actionable intelligence which is immediately passed on the GSFs. Based on these areas of collaboration, we maintain very warm relations with the hierarchy of the various Government Security Forces, as well as other relevant organizational and community stakeholders.</p><h4>What are your key priorities and expectations for Pentagon Securities in 2020?</h4><p>In 2020, one of our key priorities is to leverage on emerging technology to create even better solutions for our clients, ensuring that they remain fully satisfied with our products and services. In order for us to be successful at this, we plan to build more strategic alliances with Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and further strengthen our relationships with our foreign technical partners. Another key priority of ours is to engage our employees in more capacity building courses and training programs. We expect that these will increase our organizational efficiency and expand our capacity to swiftly deliver premium quality products and services on clients projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Grupo Corporativo Visión evolve from being a business focused on fishing to expanding its presence to other sectors?</h4><p>Grupo Corporativo Visión is a family-owned conglomerate that for many years has focused on producing and exporting sea products, though in recent years it has been exploring the aquaculture and agricultural industries. Our investment portfolio in the industry is fairly diverse and includes companies focused on transforming raw material and exports, aquaculture and agricultural research, as well as other activities in the fields of real estate, technology, communications, and scientific research in molecular biotechnology. We have been exporting food products for over 30 years. We have a strong presence in the tuna segment with products from our territorial sea, shrimp harvested through aquaculture, soups and salads with local products, and, lastly, pet food. Our objective is to grow as a company in sync with the maturity of the food industry. We also want to expand into activities that the natural flow of international business demands.</p><h4>Grupo Corporativo Visión is embarking on a groundbreaking project called Ciudad de la Alimentación (Nourishment City). How was it conceived? </h4><p>eyond creating more jobs, Ciudad de la Alimentación seeks to develop new sources of raw materials to support our economy in the future by including small aquaculture and agriculture producers and providing training based on scientific and technological research to achieve significant production in small areas. This initiative intends to identify family-owned sustainable production enterprises as the main suppliers of local and exporting food industries. This has earned a positive reputation in domestic and international markets, as it involves responsible practices toward small producers. Investing in research led us to launch pilot plans to grow prawn in greenhouses in an extremely efficient and sustainable manner. Scientific research in molecular biotechnology is the backbone of the project in order to find and apply improvements in every possible aspect of production. As a result of the application of these biotechnological tools, greater and better production is expected both in terms of quantity and quality. These seek to perfect the existent components of each element involved in the various production lines. So far, for instance, we have increased productivity by 32 times compared to extensive and traditional shrimp aquaculture. Also, by using the intensive bioengineered method, we ensure that neither the water used nor the water put back into the sea is polluted. We have invested in our labs to package a solution for small or medium-size producers to enable them to maximize their production and link their products to greater commercial value chains. More than a place, Ciudad de la Alimentación is a concept of evolution reengineering regarding the way the agroindustry sector should evolve through technology, added to an efficient logistic, industry, and market coordination.</p><h4>What products do you hope to add to the current list of exported Ecuadorian products through this project?</h4><p>We are currently exploring the market to find products of high unmet international demand that can be sustainably produced and delivered seasonally, fresh and of a high quality. For example, Fashion watermelons and Adora tomatoes are produced and sold in Europe. These are produced in a standardized manner to ensure they look, taste, and feel the same. We are reproducing this model, although this is a long-term, multigenerational project. There is already a roadmap developed in which we have defined the stages of the project. First, we need to identify the high-value products that would have a sustainable market even after accounting for logistical expenses. Then, we will start producing these existing and proven products and contribute to their global supply. Finally, we hope to create our own brand with vegetal and/or animal products under this trend. These products would also benefit from Ecuador's current push to establish more trade agreements to promote the country's products to international markets.</p><h4>What is the timeline for the construction of Ciudad de la Alimentación?</h4><p>Investment and development of the project has started in the form of the research facilities and work underway. We hope that over the course of 2020 we can launch the commercial production of shrimp. We already do it on a small scale, since we have 3,000sqm of sustainable and freshwater prawns. From there, we know there will be great interest from private groups, and we expect to grow to 500ha in the next four or five years under these production models.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current size of the university and its current focuses?</h4><p>Currently, the University of Cuenca has 16,000 students, 1,200 professors, 800 employees, and 12 schools covering all areas of knowledge. Our graduate programs are constantly changing as we adapt to market demand, national necessities, and people's interest. We are increasing the number of our doctoral programs as we invest more resources in research and commit to improving our academic offer. Furthermore, our focus is on finishing the new campus and emphasizing innovation in all activities.</p><h4>How much importance has innovation and research had in the university's recent operation?</h4><p>Historically, the University of Cuenca has excelled at training human capital for a workforce that rises to important positions due to their high-quality education in professional studies. Especially since the new Law of Higher Education was passed, the University of Cuenca has focused on strengthening research efforts and enhancing academic output. We rethought and restructured our previous professional arrangement to better understand the necessary practices to create a proper research department. This included identifying areas of study that translate into practical benefits for our country or hold academic significance. We have found that sustainability, medicine, technology, and industrial productivity are areas of study where we could partner with private institutions to obtain funding for areas that could, in turn, increase their productivity through effective research-based initiatives. We have included the participation of the Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Municipality of Cuenca in our institutional strategy to create a networking platform to enhance existing synergies. While we recognize the importance of the private sector in our research and academic curricula planning, we have also invested our own resources in the creation of a public enterprise for life sciences called the Health Innovation Center. This space connects multiple health and biology-related professionals, ultimately generating knowledge to improve our health sector. We want to find alternative or complimentary treatments for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, breast cancer, and many other conditions. We are supported by the Ecuadorian Social Security Institute (IESS), with whom we are joining efforts and resources to better treat our patients and translate our research into social progress. In the long run, we want to treat patients in our own hospital at the Health Innovation Center. </p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential for development with the support of academic institutions such as the University of Cuenca?</h4><p>For years, the ceramic industry has been gaining more exposure in Cuenca, with the multiplying effect of industry-related stakeholders setting up operations in Cuenca. The dairy industry also has a large presence, along with other cattle-related businesses like meat and leather. In general, there are several manufacturing activities supported by our graduates. However, we have not produced enough academic results for these industries yet, and there is a lot of room to grow through collaboration. Ideally, we want to reduce our dependence on foreign research and be the knowledge generators boosting our local economy. We need to create an industrial complex to make space for different institutions, public and private, and companies to collaborate and seize the potential of working toward the same goal in the same space. Strengthening our local economy and growing our national productive output are keys to creating sustainable economic growth. Yet, to achieve full resiliency and turn economic growth into social progress, we need to work on closing social inequalities and income gaps. Our increased productivity must be translated into better working and living conditions for our less-favored citizens. We need to support development routes through which the next generations born to low-income families can have access to higher education and top-class healthcare. So, whilst working on improving our productive output, helping our local companies achieve better results, and improving our trade balance, we also need to create policies that reduce our socioeconomic gap and support citizens by guaranteeing access to social services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does SENESCYT play in the national education sector and in making education more accessible across its territory?</h4><p>SENECYT establishes the scope of the country's education public policy. There are two other entities involved in the education sector in Ecuador: the National Council of Higher Education (CES) and the Education Quality Assurance Council of Ecuador (CACES). SENESCYT develops public policy, CES creates regulation, and CACES evaluates the quality of public policy in the education sector. In addition, we also coordinate certain activities in science, technology, and innovation. Among those initiatives, we offer seed venture capital funds that support the growth of new entrepreneurial ventures. We aim for a comprehensive approach to the education sector, and to do so we must not only focus on education, but also develop the infrastructure necessary to promote opportunities for the entrepreneurial sector. Access to higher education is one of our main focus areas. Today, many Ecuadorians lack access to higher education, and our national participation rate is just 57%. That is why we are working to get both public and private universities to accept more students. Many public universities have opened new campuses in different parts of the country, including some new campuses in the Amazonas region as part of the project in Amazonas Law to build four new universities in the region. We are also working to boost online education, which today only accounts for 3% of all education programs in Ecuador. Online education can be a great solution to expand the educational reach of our academic system given the lower barriers to entry compared to opening a physical campus. We are set to meet with the National Distance Education University from Spain, which will help us to develop certain online programs with other local universities.</p><h4>What is your view on the internationalization of the Ecuadorian education system?</h4><p>We want Ecuadorian students to be able to complete part of their degree abroad and have duly signed many exchange program agreements with Spanish universities. We are working to motivate universities to sign more of these agreements with institutions worldwide. Right now, our universities have many partnerships and alliances with foreign universities, but we can still do better. I recently had a meeting with Spanish universities that were willing to sign agreements with its Ecuadorian counterparts. I consider it paramount for us to establish international alliances that will allow our students to gain an international edge during their education.</p><h4>How can local universities improve in terms of research and innovation?</h4><p>We are improving, but right now we need to ensure these developments can be applied nationwide. Universities are self-governed and determine what research programs to pursue. We respect the independence of universities but continue to promote the advantages of researching new patented technologies that could ultimately become economically beneficial to the broader economy. In certain countries, universities and private institutions work hand in hand, and that is something we would like to see more of. Universities, by law, must allocate 6% of their budget to R&amp;D activities but can decide on what areas to allocate funds to. Innovation is a portmanteau term that also involves its application for life improvement, and we pursue this with many other players. For example, we have been to many entrepreneurial conferences and funded various ventures. In 2019, the country will spend USD1.2 billion to promote its commitment to R&amp;D to the benefit of the nation at large. We are particularly interested in promoting the agribusiness, fishing, and energy sectors. Ecuadorian academia has much to bring to the table in those areas, and we expect them to do so over the coming years. Education is the capstone of national development, the solution to future problems, and the engine of progress. Needless to say, it is a key component of Ecuador's Vision 2030.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is ESPOL adapting its teaching methods in order for students to acquire practical skills?</h4><p>ESPOL started reflecting on how students were being prepared for an ever-changing world and what their role in it will be. In an environment where the only constant is change, graduates need abilities to stand out, so we focused our efforts on taking crucial abilities such as communication, critical thinking, teamwork, leadership, entrepreneurship, and ethics to the next level. Additionally, 70% of our programs are related to science and technology, which enables us to teach our students how to use them in order to solve real challenges using tools such as big data. ESPOL stands out from other public universities in Ecuador, as it is the only one that maintains English as a subject. We have a high retention rate, close to 90% in the first year. Our teaching is in line with international standards, and six programs have accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), which evaluates science and engineering programs. In 2019, we aim to have 13 accredited programs, and we want to have all our programs accredited by different organizations in the next five years. ESPOL also seeks to take teaching out of the classroom, involving students in projects to work with NGOs and SMEs. The feedback we have received from NGOs has been extremely encouraging, noting our students are able to make a difference.</p><h4>To what extent is research at ESPOL aligned with the development of agriculture as a strategic sector?</h4><p>ESPOL started conducting its own research 25 years ago. When the institution was created more than 60 years ago, its purpose was to solve the problems of the region and city. The city where we are based, Guayaquil, is a port city acting as a trade center for Ecuador and the Pacific coast of South America, with strong activity in agricultural exports. ESPOL works closely with companies to identify challenges; we ask them not only what they need now, but 10 years from now, so that we can align our research and the teaching of our students with future needs. Our current research is moving more into technology applied to different sectors. ESPOL is home to different research centers focused on fields such as agricultural biotechnology, information technologies, and robotics. With this mindset, we are one of the leading institutions in conducting research on the virus potentially affecting banana plantations. We have a project with two Californian universities, Berkeley, and UC Davis, to create a virus-resistant banana. Bananas constitute 35% of the agricultural GDP and some USD2.5 billion in exports. Likewise, we have worked on shrimp and cocoa, which are also Ecuador's top exports.</p><h4>How are you contributing to entrepreneurship and innovation in Guayaquil?</h4><p>With the support of the city council, we started the Distrito 100 project. The city administration has launched ambitious projects in technological development and innovation to solve the city's issues, though the purpose was to locally create those solutions by taking advantage of our human talent. Distrito 100 came to fill that gap. It is a space where students create projects, obtain investments, and produce knowledge. It is located strategically in the heart of Guayaquil, next to the financial sector and government facilities. It is expected to become the first space in Ecuador where STEAM education is developed. The building is designed in a way that leaves the first floor open, inviting people to come and experience science. The second floor will host IoT and big data labs, and there will be co-working spaces next to anchor companies so there can be knowledge exchange. It will be inaugurated over the course of 2020 on the occasion of the bicentenary of Guayaquil, marking the path of the city's march toward the technological era.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Astinave working to elevate the status of Ecuador as a maritime country?</h4><p>Ecuador is internationally known as a maritime country because of its geographical characteristics. Still, over 90% of our economy is land-based even though we have four times more aquatic territory, with over 1.5 million sqkm of sea territory compared to 270,000sqkm of land. Proving the potential in the sector, every ship importing or exporting our products is foreign built. There have been no Panamax or post-Panamax ships ever built in Ecuador. The country needs a shipyard as it dynamizes the economy, because we only build the ship—the market still needs to provide the engines, pumps, and other components. The complexities of a military ship mean that we can build any kind of ship, be it for tourism or commerce. Astinave started building 13m boats before moving on to a 26m ship that was designed internationally. Through these 26m ships, we acquired the know-how for future clients and then replicated the model for the 50m ships. Now, we just signed a contract to build an 80m ship with military and logistics capabilities and the capacity to carry 2,500 tons. Now, the navy is expecting to acquire new 100 and 120m frigates. So, we have started building a new shipyard in Posorja next to the deep-water port for four of these ships, with each valued around USD150-200 million. Astinave also has its second line of business in ship repairs and services. According to our 2015 market research, there are 500-700 ships navigating in or around Ecuador at any given time. At least half of them must be serviced and given maintenance annually in Ecuador. The local demand is well-above the supply capacity for these services in local shipyards, as every other shipyard is even smaller than ours. Our expectation for Posorja, given that the service rates are more or less internationally set, is to seize that unserved market whilst also attracting some of the ships that operate within Ecuador and go overseas for maintenance.</p><h4>Astinave developed a naval combat software. How can this software be used by other industries?</h4><p>Our software is called Sistema Orión and was our main contribution for the navy ships, given that we had already purchased its design from international companies. Navy ships need a tool that collects information and performs data analytics for decision-making. This system allows the ship's captain to recognize a target, assign if it's friendly or not, suggest the correct weapon to use against it, and shoot it if necessary. When we bought the design, the software was the provider's intellectual property, so we had to contact them every time there was any issue. Therefore, 10 years ago, we decided to develop our own software and now have one of the best integrated naval combat systems in Latin America. Our system could be modified to be applied in commercial use for locating services for land freight and ride sharing apps through radio frequencies, satellite, mobile networks, and IPs. </p><h4>There has been a rise in private offshore activities in Ecuador. What are the opportunities for Astinave in this segment?</h4><p>Our current 40-year-old offshore infrastructure, mostly based in the northern part of Esmeralda, is to receive clean product and deliver petroleum. We are discussing the infrastructure's repair, expansion, and renewal with PETROECUADOR. We want to be able to compete in the tendering process like any other company. We need to give our local companies the possibility of proving themselves capable of handling infrastructure projects rather than asking international firms to do them. We understand the risks involved in these projects and work on properly minimizing risk. We have delivered every project successfully, even those that we had no idea how to complete when they were first assigned to us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Yildirim Group is a well-established Turkish group with significant port-related business. What were the main reason behind establishing the port in Machala?</h4><p>Puerto Bolí­var dates back to the 1970s and was initially designed to export the banana capacity of El Oro Province, the second-largest producer in the country. The port saw a reconfiguration when the decision to expand Panama Canal was made, since it involved the possibility of large vessels crossing the canal. The next problem was that Ecuador did not have ports large enough to receive these ships compared to countries in the region. One of the solutions was to look for alternatives on the open sea, and we considered Puerto Bolí­var. Its enormous potential for the development was considered, not only because of the proximity to the sea but also the hinterland. The banana business was extremely important because of its export capacity. It is the product that shipping companies most pursue in all ports, which is why El Oro Province is the second-largest banana producer. When we took over Puerto Bolí­var through a private-public alliance, it only moved 25% of the banana produced in that area. At the moment, we are carrying 40% of those bananas, and the fundamental reason is the lack of direct lines to the markets where bananas go. In terms of banana exports, our target is to account for 75% of El Oro province's exports. Our hinterland is enough for us to have supply for the next 20 years. We have great expectations. We consider it a great project that will contribute significantly to the development of Machala and support northern Peru.</p><h4>How can you to diversify the products that go through the port?</h4><p>The diversification options are huge. Yilport's current vision is to convert the port into a multipurpose port, making it an important international port. Our first task was to work on the depth; it was between 7m and 9m deep, and today it is 12.5m. For 2020, we target 16.5m, which would allow us to receive larger capacity vessels. Having a greater port capacity helps boost the exports of other products, and we want to increase our market share. This port would also be the natural port of the city of Cuenca, Ecuador's third-largest city known for its industrial production in tile or home appliances, for example. Additionally, there is a great opportunity to be the port of choice for the northern region of Peru. With the existing infrastructure and the infrastructure to be created, we are providing a new port alternative this region.</p><h4>What are the challenges in preparing Puerto Bolí­var to become a mining exporting port?</h4><p>We are in conversation with the mining sector and considering its requirements. We are located in the city of Machala, which means some environmental issues need to be solved. The port is at the center of several concentric rings, and we are building new infrastructure specifically to deal with those issues. Minerals are not in greater danger, despite their components, though we must minimize dust emissions in any form. That also involves exports of grain, corn, or wheat. In general, the port needs infrastructure, such as a greater number of warehouses and better tools to control dust. We are trained to do this and are getting ready for it. The Yildirim Group has a background in mining and has the expertise needed in this field.</p><h4>What role does digitalization play in the port?</h4><p>We are already taking the first steps of digitization and automation. In December, we launched the Navis system specializing in container control. Through that system, we are connected to the shipping companies of those containers, where we can manage an important data bank to optimize and manage both loading and unloading operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your evaluation of the start of operations at the Posorja port, and how do you plan to expand its capacity?</h4><p>The port started operations recently. During this period, there have been constant increases in productivity levels in each of the areas. As an example, the full cycle for a truck coming to our port to discharge a container, recharge another container, and leave the terminal is currently only 17 minutes. This includes the waiting time. Likewise, the loading and unloading of vessels has significantly improved since the beginning of operations. The number of containers loaded or discharged in an hour by each one of our cranes, the largest in South America, has improved every month since the port began operations, with a perfect safety record. We have received more than 100 of the largest vessels sailing through Latin American seas at their maximum load capacity. These vessels previously did not enter Ecuador due to draft restrictions; however, they now receive safe, productive, and efficient care at Posorja. We offer almost 3,000 spot-to-plug and plug-refrigerated containers to maintain the cold chain for the export of fresh Ecuadorian products like bananas, shrimp, and tuna. These good results have allowed us to gain the confidence of the actors of the port and shipping industry: more than 1,704 companies have already registered on our DP Online system and more than 15,555 telephone calls have been registered. We will soon start the second construction phase of the port,  which will double its capacity to 1.5 million containers (TEUs) a year.</p><h4>The port of Posorja is considered the first fourth-generation port in Ecuador. How will that help the main export industries of Ecuador and create opportunities to diversify the country's export basket?</h4><p>The port is being developed in accordance with international best practices and state-of-the-art technologies. Scanners, automated checkpoints, and fumigation arches are some of the elements that allow us to ensure that Ecuador has a smart port in DP World Posorja, which contributes to the development and competitiveness of the country. All scanners have x-rays, allowing for non-invasive inspection, as 100% of containers entering the port are scanned in order to detect any anomalies in the cargo. Likewise, the two arcs of fumigation, with 18 nozzles each, comply with the quaternary ammonium regulations, necessary to prevent inconveniences with this type of load. In addition, we have gained recognition as the Technological Innovation Hub of the Region within the framework of the second edition of ExpoTic Guayaquil. Through the Navis N4 Program system and operation support platforms, we have implemented IT solutions in various areas of the deep-water port in Posorja, such as door stages, yard operations and ships, opening and consolidation of containers, and billing, among others. The installed IT platforms include cloud and on-premise solutions.</p><h4>There are plans to build an extensive extra-port area that will be complemented by Guayaquil's new airport. What can be expected from this logistics hub?</h4><p>Guayaquil Gateway is a business unit of DP World Ecuador, the purpose of which is the development of a logistics and industrial ark close to the deepwater port and not far from the future airport. We will offer our services to warehouses under a customs regulation called the special economic development zone, which will allow logistics companies and industrial companies to enjoy tax incentives and exemptions. It will allow companies to attract customers through efficient logistics operations. Our goal is to welcome large companies in order to offer additional services to Ecuador and its people. We have already built 14 logistics parks around the world and are investing in more. In Dubai, our logistics park welcomes more than 7,500 companies who represent more than 30% of GDP. With that in mind, it is easy to imagine how the logistics park in Posorja can transform the face of Ecuador in just a few years' time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the new general manager of TAME, how will you channel your experience in the aviation industry to make it a more prominent airline?</h4><p>There is an understanding that we must all have pulled our weight in taking TAME to a new level of competitiveness. There are many stakeholders in the company and within the aviation sector in Ecuador who need to work together to achieve our current goals, and I am here to play my part in orchestrating the initiatives and synergies wherever possible. We are also now open to potentially partnering with bigger private groups and are already in talks with certain private investment funds to obtain what is currently impossible, namely advanced and costly technologies. Other than that, we need to rethink and redraw our routes and connections, keeping only profitable ones and ensuring key cities remain connected. I have been working in aviation for over 30 years, and my understanding of the industry will be a useful tool for TAME in meeting the company's goals, which are connectivity, security and quality. Our first strategic objective is to standardize our fleet, thus boosting the efficiency of our training, maintenance, and repair operations. Our procurement processes need to be more efficient in terms of meeting our needs through more competitively priced volume purchases. Meanwhile, our routes must be planned according to profitability as opposed to availability.</p><h4>What role does internal tourism play in TAME's strategy for connecting foreign tourists?</h4><p>We have discussed the possibility of opening a direct route from Galápagos with European airlines. We need to embrace our responsibility to connect Ecuador internally and create local economic synergies by enabling easier access between our own cities and economic players. From there, we can plan outwards and connect our cities to other destinations of interest in the region recognizing the strength of regional players and the work already done to establish profitable routes within and around Ecuador. Major regional players such as LATAM, COPA, and AVIANCA already prompt us to greater competitiveness, and to improve our service and make air travel more accessible for all. And while we recognize the presence of new players in the market, we are working to reclaim our historic 70-75% local market share regardless. This is a rapidly changing market and we need to be at the forefront of all trends. The sector is growing by 10% annually and we aim to be the principle growth factor.</p><h4>Regarding international routes, how are you planning to expand your current offering?</h4><p>We currently have two major routes in Cali and Fort Lauderdale that have set the benchmark for our upcoming routes to strengthen our network. We consider ethnic and touristic factors in our decision making, offering incentives accordingly on specific routes. Currently, we are exploring two major routes based on those considerations. One is Cancún and the other New York City due to the significant Ecuadorian community based there, adding to the touristic value of that route. Thereafter, we see significantly more potential in the Asian market, mainly because of the Korean operator of the new Manta airport that could open the doors to such destinations. As mentioned before, we are currently working on a project to increase the route availability from Europe to specific destinations </p><h4>within Ecuador including, possibly, Galápagos, thereby ensuring touristic volume.What is TAME's perspective on the pro-business changes that are happening in Ecuador, and what opportunities might it create for your operations?</h4><p>We aim to be in the best position to service potential investor interest in Ecuador and to ensure the right connectivity between investors' home countries and ours, while also making every major city or investment region easily accessible. Essentially, we aim to position ourselves as an indirect partner in the successful venture of potential economic investors by making their travel logistics a positive element to consider when venturing to Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Quiport managed to increase the number of airlines that operate at the airport to 19?</h4><p>Quiport's strategy to develop routes revolves around three main axes: networking at Routes events, which gathers airlines and airports to search for new connectivity options, visiting headquarters of different airlines, and offering incentives for airlines that seek to establish new routes and increase capacity. Under this strategy, it is essential to work alongside the central government through the Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Transport and Public Works, as well as the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. In addition, we work with the municipality of Quito through the Public Company for  Airport Services (EPMSA).</p><h4>How will the airport capacity be improved after the current expansion plans?</h4><p>The Quito Airport is the main gate of entry into Ecuador; thus, it is the responsibility of Quiport to maintain it and manage an increasing number of passengers and airlines. New airlines and routes represent an opportunity to steadily increase passenger traffic. This has increased the necessity to expand the terminal to 16,000sqm, as well as all the areas for checking, immigration, customs, and boarding gates. We are investing USD60 million using our own resources. We are not just talking about space, but also new design concepts that have been created to establish the airport's identity and offer high-quality services to passengers. Our main aim is to better the passenger experience, which we aim to do through the expansion. </p><h4>What improvements have you implemented to ensure the airport keeps operating during adverse climate conditions?</h4><p>The operational and technical sides of an airport like Quiport are extremely important. We operate an airport that it is located about 2,400m above sea level, which requires working under certain climate conditions. Thanks to a team with years of civil aviation experience, Quiport has achieved a Category 2 certification for instrumental landing. This means we can keep the airport operational almost all the time, even when there is limited visibility. This certification works in the favor of airlines and passengers because it reduces the number of delays and cancellations.</p><h4>Tourism is becoming one of the most important business opportunities in Ecuador. What strategy are you following to boost it?</h4><p>The ongoing work at the airport cannot be separated from Ecuador's tourism strategy. The markets identified under the government's tourism strategy are our priority because they represent great potential. In that regard, we are in permanent touch with the Ministry of Tourism and Quito Tourism, which promotes tourism in the city. We work with them to establish joint strategies as well as mechanisms to carry out joint negotiations with airlines. The benefits of such cooperation are tangible; working with the Ministry and Quito Tourism, we can show Ecuador's tourism wonders, the opportunities offered in Quito, and Quiport's advantages. </p><h4>What are your goals and priorities for 2020?</h4><p>Managing an airport is a complex activity; thus, we are forced to maintain several priorities. One of them is to complete the expansion project by December 2020. We also have the challenge of increasing the number of routes and flights. Another priority is to improve the experience of the passengers. Today, we are at the forefront in terms of services such as free Wi-Fi, play areas for children, breastfeeding rooms, and pet areas, among others. The challenge is to find opportunities to improve every passenger's experience. This focus has helped us to win awards at Skytrax, World Travel Awards, and Air Cargo Excellence. We have also become the president of the Council of International Airports in Latin America and the Caribbean. Although we have had a lot of success during the last seven years of operations, we still have a lot to do.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tourism is increasingly generating foreign currency for the country. How does DGAC contribute to the development of the tourism sector?</h4><p>We work alongside the Civil Aviation Council processing the requests of companies looking to open business and operate within the sector in Ecuador. The certification process is a five-step procedure in which we first assign a taskforce ad hoc between our representatives and the prospective operator and give them the guidelines of operation. They then have to define a timeline for deliverables. The team has to present its operation manuals and plans for the third stage to begin, in which we analyze the aforementioned documents. This is key, as it sets the difference between the potential operator complying with our basic set of rules and the list of conditions and standard in which operator promises to abide by, usually, a stricter and detailed plan. In the fourth stage, the solicitant needs to demonstrate its ability to comply with our guidelines and its own standards through rigorous tests performed and indicators measured to get to the fifth stage, whereby we issue all permits and certifications after due checks of all legal conditions and procedures. We recognize our role as regulators of the sector and understand the need to set the proper conditions to increase the interest foreign operators to open business with our country. We have well-developed infrastructure for both air and land transportation that could be both beneficial and a disadvantage, as there are incentives for people to travel by car rather than the significantly more expensive air travel. Contrary to people's intuition, shorter flights represent higher costs because of the operational expenses of the industry over the relative cheaper fuel costs. This is why we are working to make the sector more economically friendly through proper regulations.</p><h4>The new airport in Manta will be ready in 2020. What are the prospects for this enhanced air infrastructure? What potential do you see in developing air traffic through the Pacific Ocean using Ecuador's airspace or inland facilities?</h4><p>There is enormous potential, and we want to seize it soon. We hope it starts with ICAO assigning us the management of the route. Although it might go to Peru or Central America, we are in a better position to do it for a few reasons, such as our planned search and rescue center operating from Galapagos, the fact we already have our own flight information region (FIR) in Guayaquil, and, most importantly, the fact that we designed the route, and it makes a continental entrance through Ecuador.</p><h4>What are your priorities and plans for the next couple of years?</h4><p>We need to raise awareness and promote our brand alongside the Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Foreign Trade, and Ministry of Transportation inviting new operators, be it airlines or other stakeholders, into Ecuador. We have award-winning airports that repeatedly show the world we are world-class and ready to receive them. The second priority is to beat the misconception that DGAC and the sector in general is overregulated and hard to open a business in. We need to bring people closer to the specifics and nuances of the sectors whilst making the country aware that the development of the civil aviation sector is crucial for the progress of Ecuador.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What economic impact can be expected by improving international and domestic connectivity in Ecuador?</h4><p>The effect of increasing air connectivity can be seen directly in the domestic and international tourism sector and in the foreign trade indexes. These are activities that generate important production chains and are priority to reduce the country's economic dependence on traditional products like oil.</p><h4>What factors have contributed to making Ecuador a more attractive market for international airlines?</h4><p>The policy of open skies, implemented by President Lení­n Moreno, sends a clear message to the world that we are providing legal security for investments, specifically for commercial aviation, and demonstrating that we are a country with many things to offer. Through this initiative, we are turning ourselves into strategic partners for airlines that want to obtain a sustainable operation in the country. MTOP is the director of the air policy in the country working to offer all airline operators the possibility of participating in the market. As for new operations for 2020, we plan to include two new international airlines whose names will be announced soon. We have also been able to add seven new airlines to operate international flights, including Spirit, Gol, Laser, AirFrance, Plus Ultra, Intejet, and AirCanada, as well as others already operating in the country and have increased their flights, such as Latam and Jetblue.</p><h4>What role can the private sector play in maintaining a high level of the road infrastructure in the country?</h4><p>Once all the necessary investments are carried out to prepare the road infrastructure, the state will require a private manager to efficiently execute the operation and maintenance of the infrastructure accordingly to its cost-risk through a public-private partnership and a concession. Under this scheme, the private sector plays an important role, which is why MTOP has worked in a portfolio of possible projects that are attractive for private companies and will allow the state to guarantee the use of the country's roads.</p><h4>What infrastructure projects are in the works?</h4><p>MTOP is seeking to ensure connectivity through the implementation of models of administration in the roads and giving priority to investments in the road infrastructure. We were able to enlarge the state road network (RVE) from 9,800km to 10,160km. Our work now is to give priority to the different road infrastructure based on the needs being established through different time periods; this means it is true that there is excellent connectivity, though we still invest in expansion projects for those areas that are required. As an example, one of the most important links in the country is the Quito-Guayaquil road, which has two lanes and faces traffic congestion at times. Another area we are working on is the expansion of the Guayaquil-Machala road. These are being developed under a concession model that seeks public-private participation of projects requiring large investments. The participation of the private sector is important because that allows us to seize the experience and capacity of the financing to provide services traditionally were provided by the public sector. Additionally, we invest in reducing the number of accidents via financing from CAF and a USD215-million investment to implement the modality of maintenance per results. This project envisions a year of mandatory works and maintenance at a fixed cost for a total of five years to execute the projects in seven different areas that collectively total 1,200km.</p><h4>What level of public investment in infrastructure can be achieved in the next years?</h4><p>MTOP seeks the participation of the private sector to reduce pressure on the budget and allow private investment, while also guaranteeing a safe service for users and contributing to the social and economic development of the country. Through the implementation of this management model, we can introduce technology and innovation to improve the quality of the public services through an operative efficiency.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has INMAIA evolved as demand for balsa increases following new uses for this wood?</h4><p>INMAIA is a wood industry company located in the center of Ecuador, and most of its production is destined for balsa wood products. Balsa wood is now considered a high-quality product. It originally served as a transportation vehicle in rivers to transport bananas and other products from the central region to the ports. Before colonial times, Ecuadorian indigenous communities used it as transport to trade products into Mexico. The French came to Ecuador and discovered that balsa wood was a light product, and then they innovated it and used it for its navy ships. Balsa wood was used in World War II both for ships and planes. Currently, the product undergoes several processes, and, thanks to the use of genetically improved seeds and our unique climate conditions, Ecuador's balsa is considered the best in the world. Our country is the top producer in the world of balsa wood; the largest consumer of balsa wood is China, where it is being used to build windmills for wind parks in China because it is a light material. Today, balsa wood is also used in fast trains floors, transportation, air transport containers, in the military industry, as well as wall panels in recording studios and more. It can also be mixed with other strong materials such as aluminum. It has low thermal conductivity, low density, and high resistance to compression, flexion, and traction. The country aims to continue being the top producer, and we need investors that want to develop other lines of business out of balsa wood.</p><h4>Can you tell us about your corporate social responsibility practices, especially those related to the environment?</h4><p>Since it was founded, INMAIA was born with species that can be re-planted. We are a company that is respectful toward the environment. We are always carrying out campaigns to protect the environment. In 2017, we planted 20,000 fruit trees around Quevedo to improve the environment and taught children and young people to look after the environment. We consider our corporate image related to taking care of the environment. We are always looking for new initiatives. It is not only the responsibility of the local and national government; it is a social responsibility that includes companies. The product guarantees the sustainability of the industry, and INMAIA is fully aware of that. We promote reforestation as one of the most efficient mechanisms to capture CO2. Reforestation can capture 10 tons of CO2 per year on average, if we plant 1 million trees per year. INMAIA planted 1.05 million trees in 2019 alone.</p><h4>How are your investments meeting increasing international demand?</h4><p>Currently, we have a project to increase 30% of our production in 2020 due to demand, which means we have to go from 30 containers per month to 40-50. We will create new jobs, and it will entail a larger investment. It is important that demand increases every year, and the more we plant, the more we produce. We will additionally have doubled our positive impact on the environment, because while balsa is growing, it captures CO2, improves the condition of the soil, and increases collection of water by aquifers. Its large timber surface attracts rain, and as it filters, it produces aquifers that can be later used for water in agriculture and other purposes. As per the balsa industry in Ecuador, we are an important part of the productive sector, and we want our country to continue on the path of the current government. The country has great conditions for the agricultural business. Our country is privileged because it has a relatively small territory with diverse and fertile terrains that are born at the ocean, go through the mountains, and end up down at the Amazon jungle. We hope the country keeps growing, and we have open arms for investors who have adequate technology to improve the quality of life.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Pinturas Condor's journey in Ecuador until becoming market leader?</h4><p>Condor Industria Quí­mica Borja &amp; Leib was founded in the city of Quito in 1939. In 1972, it took on the name of Pinturas Condor, and in 2010 it was acquired by multinational The Sherwin-Williams Company, a global leader in paints and coatings. This was an important development in terms of opening the possibilities of developing new high-tech products to better serve Ecuadorian customers in terms of local culture and traditions. Sherwin-Williams has operations in more than 147 countries. In Ecuador, the company has over 500 employees, with operations all over the country and is a market leader, as it is in the US. The Ecuador headquarters and manufacturing plant are in Quito. Around 95% of the company products are sold locally, with exports to Colombia and Peru.</p><h4>How does having the support of a global company influence your operations in Ecuador?</h4><p>The great advantage is having technology transferred into the country. The products we develop uphold international standards of the company, and new technology developed in the US is produced here as well. For example, our flame-retardant paint is used to paint metal structures of buildings. After the attack in New York on 9/11, this paint was developed to delay fires in structures. It slows the spread of fire and allows people more time to evacuate. We now manufacture this type of paint in Ecuador.</p><h4>How are your in-country research facilities covering more country-specific needs?</h4><p>Pinturas Condor has greatly benefited from the existing partnership with Sherwin-Williams. We have continued to be an Ecuadorian company. We have been operating in this country for 80 years. We maintain cutting-edge technology upholding the best international standards with an integrated system of quality control and management. We have steadily led technological evolution and regulation, using the most environmentally friendly products and those best suited for the consumer. Market opportunities and consumer needs drive new product development and improvements to our current portfolio. We use our Quito technical lab to develop new products locally. If there is a specific need in the market, or there is a product in other markets that we can replicate here to local specifications, then we can develop it here.</p><h4>How can environmental practices be further advanced by companies in the paints industry such as Sherwin-Williams?</h4><p>Sustainability is an important pillar for the company. Our industrial plant, located in Quito, has won the global corporate award from Sherwin-Williams for the continued improvements we have implemented over the last two years—competing against 147 Sherwin-Williams plants across the globe. We also won the sustainability award in 2016. Our biggest achievement was to significantly reduce the waste emissions during our manufacturing processes. The site implemented a waste management program and they have reduced waste substantially in the las few years. Moreover, we won other awards in 2017 and 2018 related to areas such as quality, teamwork, and environment among other factors. Social responsibility is another important activity for the organization. We have internship programs through an agreement with the nuclear sciences department at the National Polytechnic School. Also, we develop internal programs in areas like security, health, the environment, and quality, as well as a project for the reduction of risks related to moving heavy cargo. We play an important role in the local community. We have a training center for painters, which has trained more than 4,500 people for the last 4 years. We have collaborated with different non-profits in the assessment of their maintenance and building projects. We have provided support to certain NGOs like TECHO and other entities with social goals, providing them with products, money, and support to build and paint.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The textile industry represents about 6% of Ecuador's industrial GDP. How did Delltex become one of the most competitive companies in this field?</h4><p>Delltex started officially in 1962; however, the founders had been working in the acrylic industry since 1959. The factory expanded at a fast pace in the 1960s and 1970s and started manufacturing plain cloth. The plain cloth is used to tailor uniforms and is a business that we maintain to date. In the 1980s and 1990s, the company decided to continue with its expansion plans and acquired a factory to produce a fabric for blankets. In 2000, the company was the largest blanket producer in Ecuador and Latin America. Currently, our plant serves the domestic market, and we also export to other regional markets. Innovation has always been important for us, and we have an updated technology that allows us to be competitive in both the local market and abroad. The textile market in Latin America was severely affected by Chinese products, so we have taken several steps to remain competitive and reinvent our factory. We have a well-trained staff and state-of-the-art technology. In 2017, we decided to move into the development of specialized products. One example of a new specialized product is a cloth for uniforms that is fire retardant. This innovation opens new markets for us and also gives us the opportunity to export to new textile markets in Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and the US. Besides, the ongoing trade war between China and the US has opened a window for us to sell our products in the US. We have a positive outlook for the future of our company and are exploring opportunities in areas like the automobile and military industries, even providing the curtain material for cinemas and theaters.</p><h4>How do your different investments target the production of more innovative products that are attractive in your main export destinations?</h4><p>Delltex has always had a policy of continued investment in the company. We are constantly researching new market opportunities, investing in new technology and implementing innovations in dyeing and printing. We have even started with digital printing. The same personnel that manage the manufacturing divisions are also involved in the process of creativity and innovation within the company. That is why we are developing high-quality fabrics, especially soft ones, to tailor suits. In addition, Delltex has conceived a way of working on sustainable innovation. At present, our manufacturing processes not only meet the local regulations in Ecuador, but go beyond, and this has been recognized by the local Ministry of Environment. Regarding export markets, we are exporting substantially to Colombia. Even though the dollar is a strong currency in the world economy, we have found a way to continue exporting to Colombia in a profitable way. We are also exporting plain cloth to Peru for the military and the police. We are exploring new opportunities in the US for our Ecuador-produced blankets. The domestic market has become narrower, so we have to find opportunities in other markets.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect to have 10% growth in sales in 2020 compared to 2019. We will achieve those expected results through the markets we are focusing on and by participating in more trade fairs in the textile sector to introduce Delltex in other markets. Ecuadorian people have a rich ethnic background, and textiles have always been important in the Andean countries. The local conditions have supported us for so many years, and we expect to continue growing in the short and long term.<br></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of Provefrut as the company turns 30 in 2020?</h4><p>Provefrut is Ecuador's largest exporter of frozen vegetables. In the past five years, we have effectively grown at an annual rate of 8-10%; specifically, in 2018, we had the best year in the company's history. 2019 was also great, as our plans of continued growth succeeded. For that reason, in the last few years we have made considerable investments in installed capacity in our different plants as well as in agricultural land. We currently have an installed annual capacity of about 55,000 tons of finished products ready to be exported. Additionally, the company has successfully added organic products as well, with at least 25% of its total volume being completely organic; this has diversified our portfolio. We installed a plant in northern Ecuador to process highland grains under a company called ProQuinoa, as we wanted to differentiate ourselves from our core business since quinoa is a dry product. There are a few new products that we are heavily promoting, such as spinach, cauliflower, and niche-market products, such as multicolored cauliflower and carrots. We are working to develop an Andean product called chocho, a vegetable with the highest vegetable protein value in the world.</p><h4>What role does technology play in the growth of Provefrut and in Ecuador's ambitions to become a leader in the global agricultural sector?</h4><p>Ecuador is an operationally expensive country, and in order to be competitive internationally, companies have to not only be ingenious or have different products, but also keep up with technological trends. In the end, technology equates to savings on expenditures; basically it is only to our advantage in order to compensate for the high costs within the country. In Provefrut, we believe and invest in technology.</p><h4>How can processes be matched with consumer demands in terms of socially and environmentally friendly production?</h4><p>There are audits for social responsibility, which is part of our core values that we defend as a company. Throughout the year, we have audits from the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Energy, as well as audits from the final clients and internationally recognized audit companies. Furthermore, the regulations in the countries we mainly export to, such as these in the EU, Asia, and North America, are becoming stricter, so we need to have the highest level of compliance. We have a traceability system in our product, where if the customer finds something in the final product, such as an insect or a piece of plastic, referring to the number on the packaging we can track the day, the field, and the sector that harvested the product, the day it was processed in the plant, the container it was sent via, and so on. We have a plant dedicated to the Japanese market, which produces a special product called Ready to Eat, and the production lines at the plant have additional controls.</p><h4>How will the new trade deals that the government is working on promote agricultural exports?</h4><p>Ecuador took an important first step in 2017 with the agreement with the EU. In our case, the agreement did not generate additional business since the tariff rate was already zero. However, the assessment of this trade agreement for Provefrut is positive, as it has helped us maintain a market where we export 30-35% of our total volume. With the new trade philosophy of Ecuador, there has been a revival of important relations, such as with the US. I am optimistic about the US-Ecuador trade agreement. The process will not be easy, though it could potentially waive the 14.9% tariff on frozen vegetables exported to the US. It is the right move for Ecuador to enter the Pacific Alliance. It will open up the Mexican market to Ecuadorian exports and potentially serve as a re-export hub toward North America. In general, I am in favor of free and international trade.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Centro Cerámico positioned itself within the Ecuador's ceramics industry, and how do you see the sector's potential as a whole?</h4><p>Some 40 years ago, Eljuri Group acquired Centro Cerámico, which includes different industry stakeholders from extraction to commercialization. Since then, we have quadrupled production by introducing innovation through Spanish and Italian machinery. Although we have a good hold on the local market, our production level allows us to export to other regional markets. Within the group, we have different companies that target different market segments, including luxury high-end products and a full range of construction materials and equipment on our retail chain, Keramikos. We have also developed specific distribution commercial chains for each of our factories. To diversify our operations, we recently invested in related industries such as industrial adhesive for ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, and other materials used for coverings in the construction industry. Another current focuses is sustainability. The industry could have the better standards, but we are responsible for investing in machinery and technologies that reduce electrical consumption and pollution. Our ceramics business is fully compliant with all the regulations and standards of the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources.</p><h4>How is Centro Cerámico innovating in both processes and products?</h4><p>We regularly visit international trade fairs and events to stay ahead of the curve on global trends, technology, and tools used by leading companies around the world. We recently implemented new machinery to cut, rectify, and polish our products in many different sizes. For us, the most important thing is to have our people acting like a team who looks at the entire process and judges based on parameters. Our factories are at level of automation needed to introduce a design on a computer and print it at any shape or size, which reduces waste to almost zero. The Eljuri Group is also partners of the Ferro Corporation Group, who we have joined to open ESFEL, a factory with a product development laboratory where our best designs have been created. This allows us to create our own products and innovate whilst gaining Ferro Spain and Mexico's knowledge about new inputs and materials. For that reason, we are not restricted to buying existing overseas formulas. We have our people work at Ferro to learn how to produce the newest products and transfer that knowledge to our factories in Ecuador to produce these products on a larger scale. Centro Cerámico has invested in European technology, world-class standards of quality, and environmentally-conscious production. Currently, 80% of our high-end production is sold locally, with the rest going to US, Colombia, Peru, Jamaica, Panama, Costa Rica, Salvador, Honduras, and other markets in smaller quantities. Due to the US tariffs on Chinese ceramics, we now represent an attractive market for the US. Our factories are working at a 75-80% capacity, and we are able to meet the demands of that market should their interest materialize.</p><h4>How is Centro Ceramico dealing with the recent contraction of the construction sector?</h4><p>According to our forecasts, 2020 will see a change in that contraction trend. We have many projects in our pipeline. Looking the last half of 2019, we feel bullish about our expectations as we have seen many projects restart, and construction companies invest again. We are due for an economic turnaround and want to be ahead of the curve. We will continue to invest in new technology and expand our operations. For 2020, we will continue to open stores and invest in further expanding our product portfolios. We are open to partnering with foreign groups that want to enter the local market, similar to the way we have successfully done with Kohler for many years, as well as partner with international companies that see potential in their market for our products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Coronavirus directly affected Alef Education at an operational level?</h4><p>From an operational level, I would like to answer the question in two parts. First, how prepared are we to service our customers and two how prepared are our internal operations to handle a displaced workforce of 300+ people that have had to what seems like a switch to a home office scenario. From a customer vantage point, the Alef Education platform is well prepared for events such as these. With the ability for students and teachers to log in and access lessons and gather real-time feedback, we have seen a surge in usage and also interest from various countries to support their distant learning initiatives. All of our lessons across six core subjects are pre-built and aligned with the curriculum of the Ministry of Education and also US Common Core standards. As a result, students can continue learning independently or with tools such as Google Classroom and Microsoft teams, which are all enabled through our platform by a single sign-on. These tools allow teachers to deliver remote classroom teaching and powered by the curriculum aligned lessons and content that is available. The impact of school closure has had a minimal effect on learners who are using our platform. Furthermore, we have also partnered with the Ministry of Education, ADEK and KHDA to offer our flagship Alef platform along with two other supplementary products called Abjdiyat and Curio (K-9 Arabic, Math, and Science digital resources) for free to anyone in the UAE or across the world. Alef Education is doing its part to help contribute to schools, students, and teachers displaced due to the global education crisis caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. You can find out more by visiting our website at <a href="http://www.alefeducation.com">www.alefeducation.com</a> and following us at #LearningDoesNotStop. In terms of remote working plans for our staff, we anticipated this need well in advance, and most of our teams already work in an agile manner. We have tested and provided our staff with the necessary tools to continue their work remotely with a limited impact on the day to day business operations. With the support of the UAE government and partners providing collaboration tools, we have managed to cope well with remote working given current day events.</p><h4>What is your perspective on the broader impact that the virus will have on the education sector in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>There is going to be a significant increase in investment/expenditure in the global Ed-Tech landscape where digital-first classrooms and tools required by schools, students, and teachers will be made a priority. I see the emergency of distant learning being the new normal, and I do believe that online and virtual education will also drive the education sector past the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. In addition, I foresee a surge by education institutions fast-tracking their digital transformation agendas as a result of current day events that have displaced more than 1.3 billion learners globally. As for Abu Dhabi and the UAE, I strongly feel that a digital-first strategy is already a core pillar of the 2021 vision. Moreover, I feel the impact will be more of a re-emphasis on on-line and distant learning and a re-thinking of strategies to support virtual classrooms both in the K-12 and Higher Ed domains.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>COVID-19 has left logistics companies scrambling to change their operations to react to vast changes in global transportation. In Turkey, how has transportation been impacted by the ongoing crisis?</h4><p>It is affecting the entire supply chain process significantly. For air freight, with the cancellation of almost all passenger flights, cargo can only be moved on dedicated cargo aircraft rather than in the belly of passenger aircraft. In Turkey, that capacity is limited to Turkish airlines' 24 cargo aircraft and MNG's five. Capacity has fallen substantially, and the cost of moving cargo by cargo aircraft is two to three times more expensive than the cost if the cargo and passenger aircraft are combined. Moving to road transportation, because of drivers being seen as potential carriers of the virus, the Ministry of Health has quarantined any driver that enters Turkey for 14 days. There needs to be another way to control this. We have asked for test kits to be sent to the border so that drivers can be tested. The current situation has made trucking not only expensive but close to impossible right now. Looking at sea freight, the crunches faced by air and road has created an additional demand for containers—there are not enough empty containers. Without empty containers coming from China over the past several months, export prices have gone up 40-50%. Booking space on a container vessel has also been delayed greatly. Finally, looking to rail, the Turkish Railroad Administration has 1,200 cars available. It had 2,200 railcars full of orders that it cannot fulfill. Everyone has to wait to send something by rail because of the lack of available equipment.</p><h4>How has KITA Logistics used technology to cope with the ongoing COVID-19 impact?</h4><p>Technology is important right now. If we did not already have the technology installed in our company, then we would not have been able to do our jobs from home. We have cloud-based software so every single person has access to do their jobs. They can realize shipments and invoice clients from home. No one is the office, but our business is still running as usual. We are using technology for our operations and the tracking of cargo from satellite systems on the trucks to full traceability of each and every container and air freight cargo. We follow each shipment in full transparency right now. This helps clients to plan accordingly.</p><h4>The government has responded to the developing economic crisis with a relief package for the logistics sector, among others. How is it helping you cope with the impact of COVID-19?</h4><p>It is a good start, but it is not enough. First, any supply chain personnel that has to move, such as flight engineers, pilots, air crew, ship crew or drivers, needs to continue to move. This is important to understand. Another important consideration is that many people will be unable to pay their debts or loans on time because of the cash flow issue. As a result, our request is for companies to not be blacklisted if they do not pay on time. That will affect their credibility when this is a force majeure situation. The banks and financial system have to pardon these companies for a few months. This is the first time our sector has experienced such a collapse. There have been some tax incentives, which we absolutely appreciate. It is a positive step, but these are just not enough. We expect more from the government in terms of measures for relief of the logistics sector and the whole economy.</p><h4>As a result of falling industrial activity in China, many Middle Eastern importers have shifted to purchasing Turkish exports. Do you see this as a long-term diversification away from Chinese imports?</h4><p>Some countries, including Turkey, have realized that being dependent on raw materials or by products from China could be a catastrophe when something like this happens. So, purchasing markets will become diversified. Because of lack of service and supply from China, companies have moved to Turkey for their orders because their purchasing teams were unable to go China. Now they are not going anywhere, though. In about a month's time, Chinese orders will pick up as they have almost recovered from COVID-19. I do see import countries diversifying their sources so they are not reliant on a single source in the future.</p><h4>Outside of the ongoing crisis, how has KITA Logistics shaped its strategy around the evolving nature of globalization?</h4><p>In the service industry, long-term plans or strategies can be changed in a second depending on the changing client needs, such as is the case for importers for Chinese goods. We are moving cargo mainly across borders—90% of our business is international. We have seen growth recently in the Middle East and Africa, whereas historically we have focused on the European and East Asian markets for exports and imports, respectively. The African market has started buying a fair bit from Turkey, so we are working to grow our market share for Turkish exports to Africa, particularly in Tunisia, West Africa, and South Africa. In those markets, we see potential for air freight and sea freight service.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fira de Barcelona was founded in 1932 as a consortium between the government of Catalonia and the chamber of commerce. What was the idea behind its inception?</h4><p>The idea was to bring together different institutions that collectively intended to position Barcelona as an important player in the global MICE industry. At present, we manage Fira as a private company since we have a board comprised of businesspeople. In 2000, politicians chose a model of management based on private companies. Fira's shareholders are the Barcelona City Council, the government of Catalonia, and the Barcelona Chamber of Commerce, which together constitute the assembly that appoints nine board members. What improvements can be made to further consolidate Barecelona's position as a leader in the global MICE industry? There is always room for improvement. We will start managing the CCIB from 2021 onward, which is an important venue owned by the city council. Besides, we are enlarging our Gran Via Venue. As result, we will manage the three largest venues in Barcelona and its metropolitan area: Gran Via in L'Hospitalet, the historical Montjuïc in Barcelona's city center, and CCIB in the new economic area near the Besí²s.</p><h4>Fira de Barcelona now manages 400,000sqm. With the addition of CCIB and incorporation of its spaces in 2021, what are your goals and targets?</h4><p>Those venues are complementary. Gran Via hosts corporate events that are customized to the needs of clients. For example, a large SAP event will be held there. Gran Via targets big companies that need large spaces tailored to their needs. Montjuïc is the historical venue where we host B2B and B2C events such as the Manga Barcelona comic convention, educational fairs, and the Valmont Barcelona Bridal Fashion Week. CCIB is different; it is perfect for congresses and corporate events. Beyond that, we are now planning to expand the Gran Via venue. We will build a new hall by 2024 that will offer an additional 60,000sqm. It will then become one of the most important venues in Europe. Since CCIB has about 100,000sqm, collectively, all the venues managed by Fira will boast around 500,000sqm.</p><h4>How do you manage to attract companies to hold their corporate events and congresses in your venues?</h4><p>If we can organize the Mobile World Congress, as we have done, we can host any event. We are an organization with the experience and capacity to host large conventions. In 2021, we will host ISE, the most important event in Europe focused on the audiovisual industry. We have been in talks with ISE for a decade to get it to relocate to Barcelona. Our commercial team explains the city, the venue, and our capacity to manage everything they need.</p><h4>How do you make yourselves known in other markets? </h4><p>We hold events abroad for different reasons. One of our most successfully events was the Smart City Expo. After seeing its success, other cities asked us to hold similar events. This strengthens our corporate brand while supporting the Barcelona brand. Second, the logic of being abroad responds to commercial opportunities. For example, we will organize a swimming pool industry event in Mexico in 2020. Third, when organizing events in Cuba for example, we are attracting companies from Europe to Cuba. Catalan, Spanish, and European companies can seek opportunities in Cuba through the events that we host there.</p><h4>What are your main challenges and opportunities for 2020?</h4><p>We will once again host the Mobile World Congress. Furthermore, we will launch new events such as the Barcelona Wine Week. Each year, we identify sectors which can get a boost from hosting an event. We will also host the Alimentaria event in April, one of the leading events in Europe for the food and beverage industry. In 2021, we will also host ISE and Seafood. In 2015, the turnover of FIRA was EUR150 million, but in 2019 it was more than EUR215 million. Our goal for 2020 is to consolidate this growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador is the world's second-largest exporter of tuna. What is Marbelize's positioning in this strategic industry?</h4><p>Marbelize's core business is the export of tuna. We export 70% of our production to Europe, 26% to the Americas, and the remaining 4% is sold in Ecuador. We focus on Europe, because it has the highest consumption of tuna per capita. The tuna industry went through various crises, but the most difficult one was when prices fell from USD2,200 per ton to USD950. We had to reinvent ourselves, which took us out of our comfort zone and pushed us to be more competitive by identifying new consumer needs and focusing on reducing operating cost, but never affecting our two main drivers, which are quality and consumer satisfaction. With this in mind, Marbelize was able to achieve USD100 million in sales and 40,000 tons of production in 2019 compared to USD84 million and 30,000 tons in 2018. Our goal for 2020 is to process 45,000 tons of tuna. We will focus on de-commoditizing our product and bringing more added value by offering a wide variety of items following each specific client preferences, as well as strengthening our commitment to maintain our leadership in the American continent as the biggest producer of catering pouch pack sizes. We were the first Ecuadorian exporter to introduce tuna in glass jars. Today, we offer innovative formats, such as ready-to-eat tuna with spices, tuna salad with different ingredients, frozen breaded olives with stuffed tuna, and premium fillets with natural flavors.</p><h4>Ecuador and the US have restarted talks on a potential trade deal. What are the prospects for tuna exports to this vast market, and what other markets might look promising for the company?</h4><p>The US is in the spotlight, because apart from its large population, it is a market that is always looking for new things to try. Marbelize is a good partner, because it follows best practices and processes as part of its standard business. These can be used for marketing in the US, as consumers would respond well to a dolphin-safe label or a kosher certificate. It is an opportunity for producers to connect with consumers and strengthen this type of practice, and these methods are coming into place not only for tuna, but for the whole food industry. One of our main goal is to identify new consumer needs by having a R&amp;D department where new products, flavors or packaging take place. We also have our eyes on the Middle East as a new prospect for tuna exports.</p><h4>The company is also diversifying its products by offering different proteins. What are the plans for adding this new product line?</h4><p>Our 19 years of experience in the tuna industry lead us to identify new business opportunities, such as creating different protein-based products such as shrimp, beef, pork, and chicken. As a result, we started a technified pork farm company with a meat and sausage process line and a high-end supermarket called Merkato. We offer top quality and value-added products in order to be prepared to seek an opportunity in the international market in the future. For now, one of our biggest challenge is to combat the informal pork breeding market, which comprises 70% of our country production. We will concentrate on leading with responsibility and educating consumers on our sustainable product that complies with all the sanitary regulations.</p><h4>Companies in the agricultural sector in Ecuador need to add value to their exports. How has Marbelize achieved this?</h4><p>Marbelize invests a percentage of its total revenue into innovation and development every year. We are constantly testing new products and formats, especially in ready-to-eat options. For example, Marbelize is offering 80g tuna pouches to be sold at strategically selected places such as gyms, supermarkets, and sports stores. We are working to promote this product for athletes, because it is one of the healthiest proteins.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company been gaining prominence as a cardboard provider for Ecuador's banana strategic exporters?</h4><p>The company was founded in 1965 and was originally linked, and still is, to the banana industry. Around the 1960s, the production of cardboard boxes began in Ecuador, closely related to the banana industry. For many years, this company was part of Dole, one of the largest producers and distributors of fruit in the world. In 2009, Dole decided to stop the production of boxes and focus on fruits, and in that year Grupo Surpapel acquired 100% of Procarsa. Grupo Surpapel started operations in the country between 2000 and 2002, distributing packaging materials. The group incorporated a recycled paper mill in 2011 that provides 70% of the paper Procarsa uses. The group also has a company called Repapers in charge of recycling. Today, Procarsa's operations are still focused on the banana industry, bringing new solutions and adapting to international trends for packaging. The cardboard industry in Ecuador depends on the banana industry, which uses 800,000 tons of cardboard per year. The average consumption per capita of paper in Ecuador is 47kg of paper per year, higher than the average in Latin America, at 43kg a year but much lower than the 250kg per year consumed in the US or Europe. The high local use of paper per capita is due to the export industry, which uses around 60% of the total. The Ecuadorian banana represents 33% of all banana consumption in the world. It mainly goes to Russia, the Middle East, Europe, the US, and South America.</p><h4>How are you working to increase the use of recycled material, and how is paper collection being encouraged?</h4><p>Procarsa processes over 160,000 tons of cardboard per year, and 70% of the paper it uses is recycled. The other 30% is imported paper from the US, which is virgin fiber. Virgin fiber currently has a large percentage of recycled paper in its formula. Our objective is to integrate even more recycled paper in our supply chain, so that 100% of our products are environmentally friendly. There are over 2,000 families in Ecuador involved directly or indirectly with paper recycling. Repapers helped to organize an informal sector and trained a segment that moves over 7,000 tons of recycled paper in the country with over 5,000 people involved. This was possible due to the creation of over 600 green points of recollection, where the gatherers can bring the product. Afterward, it is classified, organized, and transported to the paper mill. It is an important social endeavor, because in Ecuador only around 35-40% of recycled paper and cardboard is used. It is a process to reach higher percentages, because there should be more social awareness amongst consumers to separate waste in their own homes.</p><h4>What technologies are trending in the cardboard industry?</h4><p>Ecuador has changed significantly in the last few years, mainly positively, which has made the industry more competitive. There were investments to substitute the imports of some resources used in the country, including paper. Paper manufacturers like us exist because that policy changed. In 2010, we were pioneers in investing in a paper mill that substituted imports amounting 120,000 tons of papers; however, the country keeps using more paper. Additionally, the paper industry has been forced to innovate because the market is dynamic and has been changing; for example, transport lots are smaller. It used to be a whole ship but now is just a container. Before, one had to produce the same box for two days, and now there are orders for just 500 boxes, and we can have over 200 orders per day. We have had to change the technology in order to have machines that can be quickly adjusted and can produce high-quality graphics so that the box can be placed in shelves for the final consumer following the import country regulations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador has managed to survive the Fusarium crisis that affected regional players. How has Reybanpac dealt with it?</h4><p>We quickly responded to the alarms raised in Colombia and adapted our production process through exclusion and fungi control, adjusting them to the Australian standards. We have been researching about varieties that are either tolerant or resistant to this strain of Fusarium for some time now and will be able to acclimatize it to Ecuadorian soil in two to three years. We have faced these challenges in the past with different levels of success, and we are working on improving our record and helping the industry. The government has played its part and issued a series of decrees and regulations to raise awareness on the threat and enable knowledge transfer of best practices. Now it is up to us as producers to decide which standard of quality or biosecurity to adopt.</p><h4>In the context of the recent trade agreements signed by Ecuador, which markets present the best potential for the banana industry?</h4><p>Europe represents the highest potential for us. This became evident when our exports grew by 20% after signing the multi-party trade agreement. Still, we do not want to depend on any single market. At present, Russia represents our second-most important market. Asia is also part of our long-term plans. Ecuador needs to sign FTAs with countries such as China and South Korea. Costa Rica already has FTAs with a number of markets in Asia, so it will take a national effort to enter these markets. With regard to the US, we have actually reduced our exports there to 10% of our total exports. Around 27% of our exports go to the EU and 25% to Russia.</p><h4>What are the company's CSR and sustainability activities?</h4><p>Latin American producers are generally responsible and concerned with the livelihood of the people involved in the industry and the inclusion of environmentally friendly practices, and Ecuador is way ahead of the rest of the market. We have strict labor and environmental regulations in Ecuador. Reybanpac was recently awarded the Good Business Practices 2019 recognition due to its care and responsibility toward its collaborators. Some modern markets are increasingly demanding better social and cultural labor practices for producers and higher quality products. Customers want to be aware of the quality of life of everyone involved in the process.</p><h4>What are some of the ways in which Reybanpac is working to add value to its exports?</h4><p>There are some high value markets that are willing to pay for quality. A case in point is Japan, which demands specific sizes, color, packaging, labeling, and flavor. Overall, all markets demand better quality and products according to their consumers' preferences. There are many technologies projected to be integrated into our business, such as blockchain, drones, and robotic process automation, among others. Technologies will make our processes more efficient and increase our productivity. This will enable Ecuador to enter new markets.</p><h4>What are your main projects and plans in the short and medium term?</h4><p>We are working on creating value for our customers with the implementation of technological advancements that improve quality, security, and traceability of the product. The public and private sectors need to join forces and work toward the creation or enhancement of trade channels and opportunities. As a national industry, all stakeholders must improve Ecuador's brand and open or deepen the relationship with international markets whilst refining the trade conditions to expand commercial activities. Finally, we need to raise awareness about the economic significance of the agriculture industry. From the perspective of tax collection and generation of foreign currency, the success of the agroindustrial sector represents the wellbeing and livelihood of an important portion of the national population. At Reybanpac, we are happy to supply close to 10% of Ecuador's banana exports and grow with the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the latest developments in the banana industry, especially in terms of diversifying exports to new markets?</h4><p>We must highlight the opening of Ecuador as a country. In 2017, the FTA with the EU entered into force, which led us to improve the participation in that market under the same conditions as Colombia, Peru, and Central America. We continue our consolidation in the Russian market, which is the first destination country of Ecuadorian bananas and makes up 23% of all exports in 2019. It should be mentioned that Ecuador has a participation of 95% in this market. Additionally, since 2018 Ecuador has been expanding its banana export map to South Korea, Japan, and China, although we have tariffs that are superior to those of our competence. Fruit quality improves the perception, the purchase of importers and consumer demand. Another market with an excellent performance is the Middle East. Our exports are in the rise thanks to an improvement in the political situation. Instead of reexporting from Turkey to those markets, some ships deliver directly in countries of those markets. Nevertheless, the region growing at a rapid pace is Africa, especially North Africa, including countries like Algeria and Tunisia, register a 132% of increase in 2019 as compared with 2018. This great performance in exports is reflected in a greater economic and social impact. Banana plantations represent 200,000ha, about 450,000 direct workers, and 50,000 indirect employees related to the rest of the chain; the banana sector represents 3% of Ecuador's GDP.</p><h4>How has AEBE helped producers of all sizes become increasingly aware of Fusarium and ways to protect crops against it?</h4><p>Since 2009, AEBE has been working on contacting the best experts and researchers in Fusarium so that, within our international event, they can give the best recommendations to the producing sector and the national government in order to be better prepared, proof of which are the regulations that AGROCALIDAD has promulgated on the subject. Ecuador's minister of agriculture has led meetings with his Latin American counterparts to establish regional procedures such as contingency plans and biosafety protocols to prevent as much as possible the advance of Fusarium in Colombia. The biosecurity protocols allow us to protect our plantations to prevent the spread of Fusarium and to manage the situation should the disease occur and ensure that it does not spread as rapidly as it did in the Philippines or China. AEBE has worked with governments to encourage cooperation entities such as the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) to organize summits to establish regional contingency plans from Mexico to Argentina. We need a regional plan for the import of banana species that can work in Latin American plantations and that are resistant to this threat. We are working with IICA to support ongoing training for small farmers and workers. From 2015, we have a regulation that requires all containers arriving in the country either full or empty and regardless of their origin, to be fumigated before leaving port terminals.</p><h4>What can we expect from the evolution of AEBE?</h4><p>This association turned 21 years old. We started with five companies and are currently 50. We represent 70% of Ecuador's banana exports and 35 companies of the rest of the productive chain. We have worked hand in hand with the state to support specific issues. We have also worked with the government on the implementation of a successful program called SANIBANANO along with the phytosanitary entity for better control in banana plantations and ports to ensure the phytosanitary quality of Ecuador. We must have solid agricultural, social, and environmental practices, as that is what the future market demands. Every week, we have new challenges that are being overcome by the producers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador is joining the Pacific Alliance with countries that are also chocolate producers. How is this expected to affect Pacari and the sector in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are finally joining these markets, which will allow us to be on par with our neighbors. In this context, we need to showcase our chocolate and its advantages. In Latin America, Ecuador is definitely the country of chocolate. All Ecuadorians take chocolate abroad, so Pacari goes everywhere. When people try it, they want to know more about it. The positioning is done by word of mouth recommendations. Ecuador has around 70% of the genetic bank of all cacao species, so the association of Ecuador with the idea of excellent chocolate producer is a matter of time. We are already well known in Colombia, for example.</p><h4>How has Pacari's chocolate been recognized internationally, and what has been key to this recognition?</h4><p>Pacari has been recognized at the International Chocolate Awards in blind tastings performed by 25,000 people. In these tastings, there are many chocolates from around the world, and in total we have around 300 awards. Around 85% of the cocoa in the world comes from farmers who earn less than USD25 per family each month. We pay higher, and that is one of our secrets. When we started, when someone in Europe sold 1kg of cocoa, its price was EUR130. Here, it costs USD1. It was 130 times less, so we decided to pay triple. The farmer started taking care of the cacao, and the Ecuadorian cacao that was believed to be extinct started to resurface. We improved the quality by investing in a long term. Due to that long-term planning, eight years later we were winning awards, and our quality has not fallen since then. Our secret is fairness and taking care of our providers. We motivate farmers to do the best job possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the new Ecuador Premium and Sustainable strategy aim to position Ecuadorian products in the global markets?</h4><p>Ecuador is an agricultural country with the weather and soil conditions necessary to produce a great variety of farming products, which have the potential to be acknowledged and stand out at an international level. The Ecuador Premium and Sustainable strategy has five pillars: tackling deforestation, tackling poverty, empowering women in rural areas, quality, and traceability. These five points will allow Ecuador's farm products to be better known in the world. The strategy also considers new global trends being adopted by consumers who are more responsible and committed to good agricultural practices. Thus, we must reach the international market with a strategy to meet the demands of all the different international consumers. We are doing this by participating in different events, such as the Fruit Logistica trade fair in Germany.</p><h4>What measures are you taking to diversify Ecuador's export portfolio in an attempt to reach certain product niches of high-added value?</h4><p>Consumers are moving to products that meet certain quality standards established by the good agricultural practices. These standards also take the environment and the farmer into consideration. Thus, as the regulator of the farming sector in this country, the ministry is working to develop traceability systems and promoting sustainable farming in every region. On the other hand, we have worked to improve productivity with quality and innovation through certain programs and projects in rural areas. In addition, we have worked to support the generational change so that younger populations in rural areas decide to take up farming. We want the youth to also help us to implement new technologies in the sector. A good example of a new technology being implemented is that of the Fito and Zoosanitary Regulation and Control Agency (Agrocalidad), which is monitoring fruit flies in farming areas. We have been able to include certain non-traditional farming products in the nation's strategy to further boost exports, which is an advantage for the agricultural sector and a source of good news for Ecuador. This includes pitahaya, blackberry, tree tomato, and other fruits that can provide an added value.</p><h4>The Ecuadorian agricultural sector has a large number of small producers. What does their production represent for the country and how are you working to make them more efficient and competitive at an international level?</h4><p>As of 3Q2019, Ecuador registered a total of 7.9 million people employed. Of those, 2.3 million work in agriculture, so the sector accounts for 28.6% of the country's workforce. The majority of the people who work in agriculture are small producers, in other words, they harvest fields under 5ha. These farmers mostly produce coffee, cacao, rice, and corn. In total, these crops cover 53% of Ecuador's total area. Thus, the ministry is working alongside producers to guarantee the quality of their products. Our technicians at a national level transfer the technical and technological knowledge to the farmers so that they can carry out their activities in a better way. Also, we constantly train them about the right processes after each harvest to increase the added value of the final products. This is part of our Premium and Sustainable strategy. On top this, we have a program to empower women in rural areas. We have been able to find, thanks to those associations, market niches that seek sustainably produced products. The state also wants to establish clear regulation to create a framework for each player participating in the different value chains in the different products that are developed in Ecuador. That's another goal we have established. As a result of such efforts, cacao will be a sustainable crop until 2030, thanks to a plan that we have developed to improve the competitiveness of the crop.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Being located in the Andean mountains, Ecuador has great geological potential. As a result, many large projects are being discovered in Ecuador. The main challenges in Ecuador are social and environmental issues, which are the same as in the rest of the world. However, in Ecuador mining company still have to work to create a culture of responsibility that can be filtered down across society, focusing on the fact that responsible mining with international standards can work to the benefit of the country, the same way it works in neighboring countries. In this context, Salazar Resources started its own projects in Ecuador, financed largely by international investors through a listing on the Toronto Venture Exchange in 2007. We made a new deposit discovery at Curipamba, and continued exploration there for several years also starting joint venture agreements with foreign companies operating in Ecuador. Thus far, we have developed three projects, including the Curipamba project, a volcanogenic massive sulfide district located in central-west Ecuador in the Western Mountain range, where the company owns seven concessions of about 30,000ha. We also have other projects in the exploration stage in Ecuador, which offers the investors of Salazar the great opportunity to obtain a new development project. In the short term, we will focus on our main discovery, the El Domo deposit in the Curipamba project. We expect El Domo to start operating in three years' time. Over this time, we will carry out the feasibility studies and then start construction. Our technical team is based in Quito, though our shareholders are in London and Canada. Our main objective is to keep making discoveries in Ecuador, as we have a competitive advantage by being Ecuadorian and the geology is some of the most prospective geology in the world. We also have a subsidiary in Colombia, where Salazar Resources has applied for five mining concessions in department of Nariño, with a total of 25,000ha.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecuador is putting an electric mobility plan in place to make transport more efficient. As an electric vehicle provider, how is BYD enabling this transition?</h4><p>BYD is a leader on a global scale in producing and commercializing e-vehicles. The company is in Ecuador because the country has one of the highest potentials for electrical mobility. 90% of electricity generation is through hydropower plants, and there are ongoing projects in solar and wind. On top of that, fuel is heavily subsidized. As a result, there is room for the development of electrical mobility options as an energy-efficient transport means. While electric cars are becoming a trend worldwide, in Ecuador the first adopters have been private taxi and bus entities with strong governmental support, with cities like Guayaquil adopting an electric bus fleet, Loja giving incentives for taxi drivers that opt for electric vehicles, or Cuenca establishing electric bikes stations. In addition, Ecuador has 0% VAT for e-vehicles, as well as other 0% sales taxes for batteries and other input, which together create a solid ecosystem for the development of this new trend. However, oil subsides still make the alternative a cheaper option, despite its costs on the environment and society. If these subsides were used for electric mobility, they would definitely help popularize it, not to mention generate revenue for the government, as subsidized diesel would no longer be needed.</p><h4>Which projects serve as first examples of electric mobility adoption in Ecuador?</h4><p>Thanks to the tax incentive scheme for electric vehicles, we are working with the city of Guayaquil, for example, to provide 200 new e-taxis. BYD built the largest public battery charger in the country, and there are plans to build up to 30 more across the country before 2020. The city already has a fleet of 20 electric buses. This transition in Guayaquil has also received great financial support, especially from the Corporación Financiera Nacional, which see in electromobility a cleaner and smarter transport system, and the City Hall of Guayaquil, which has a special economic incentive program. Electric buses tend to reduce maintenance and operational costs by 76%. Additionally, a single diesel bus generates emissions of about 90 tons of CO2 per years, while electric buses are emissions-free.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sectors have marked Schneider Electric's presence in Ecuador?</h4><p>Schneider Electric provides digital solutions for efficiency and sustainability in various sectors. In doing so, we combine world-leading energy technologies, real-time automation, software, and services into integrated solutions for homes, buildings, data centers, infrastructure, and industries. We have been working in Ecuador for more than 25 years, where the energy industry has been one of our main businesses, ranging from oil and industry to utilities. Nowadays, we are seeing more opportunities in boosting digitization and the development of the circular economy, but most of our gains have been in energy distribution due to Ecuador's increasing emphasis on alternative sources. This new segment is not new to Schneider Electric, since the company has extensive experience and knowledge in these fields in other countries. Regardless of the source, the company is driving processes more efficiently, reliably, and securely. On the other hand, the mining segment has the potential to become an important revenue generator. Schneider has an expert team in the Andean region dedicated to mining that has started working in Ecuador in order to boost digital technologies that optimize these processes. Our company is also supporting the digitalization of prominent industries in Ecuador, contributing to the development of new technologies such as IoT, and boosting the digital economy of companies across Ecuador and the Andean. In fact, 5% of the company's revenue at the global level is invested in research and development to deliver new digital and connected technologies to our customers. Paired with our international presence, this translates into a great ability to bring new solutions, tools, and initiatives to help grow businesses in local economies.</p><h4>To what extent can international companies transfer skills and knowledge to the country?</h4><p>Schneider Electric is a multinational company, which represents a great advantage, since we transfer our knowledge from country to country. We are very impressed with Ecuadorian talent. Our entire organization in the country is well trained, which increases knowledge transfers on a daily basis.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has digital transformation taken place in Peru?</h4><p>Digital transformation has been a constant concern over the last five years in Peru, and its implementation faces implications that depend on the sector that we want to focus on. These are four segments. First are multinationals, second are Peruvian firms focused on the Latin American region, third are large firms operating in Peru, and fourth are those firms that don't fall into any of the other three groups. As for digital transformation itself, it is happening on a larger-scale in the first and second group, because the nature of their tasks is related to areas where technology is accessible and easily applied. Unlike the first two groups, in the third one, controversy and discussions regarding its application abounds, while at the same time money to invest lacks. Finally, in the fourth sector, although several people talk about its applications, it is yet not on the schedule of daily operations. On top of these, we can add complications such as the expensive cost of technology, including AI, making it hard to adopt. Precisely because of these reasons, mostly larger companies can afford to implement it, while the smaller ones can do nothing but dream about it. There is a lot still to be done.</p><h4>What role are you playing to adapt these technologies?</h4><p>In CENTRUM PUCP, we provide our students with the knowledge and tools to implement these strategies, regardless of the type of segment it works or wishes to work for. We have gone through a dramatic change in our educational model, adapting to our student's needs and improving our educational portfolio. We shifted from a model that was composed by 100% in-person courses to what we call a blended model. Nowadays, many of our lessons are taught online. Our school offers a wide selection of courses related to these new technologies. We acknowledge that industry experience is equally important to understand this topic, that is why we have a partnership with IBM, with whom we have developed one of our courses. Furtheremore, we have invested in some technologies to adopt AI and apply in different initiatives of the program. For example, one of them is called 'personality insights,' in which the student has to respond to questions related to a hypothetical story presented to him. These answers are then matched to the information provided by your social networks. The results can immediately give us insights about your leader profile as well as areas of improvement and strong areas. In other applications, we went further and used AI and neuroscience methodologies to analyze neural sensors connected to a student during the projection of a movie with topics aligned to business situations. Through these sensors, the machine measures the person's emotions. The computer then evaluates what happens in your brain while you witness that situation. As a third application, we have invested in featuring virtual reality. For instance, we know that many of our students face the difficult task of working while they study; therefore, we are developing a VR application that would allow them to visit our facilities without the need to be physically present at these locations.</p><h4>With Women CEO Peru, you created a program for women in high executive positions. How did this program come into being?</h4><p>In CENTRUM PUCP, we have always wanted to represent a responsible organization. Following our philosophy, we identified an area where few initiatives had been done, that is, women's empowerment. Specifically, we encountered that women face some disadvantages, particularly in the work environment, which resulted in fewer women holding executive roles in Peru. Thus, we sought an institution that could bring better opportunities for women in the executive world with whom we developed a program aimed at training women in implementing strategies in the executive world. The impact has been excellent. The program is part of our commitment to foster corporate social responsibility.</p><h4>What other partnerships have you struck with other important private companies? </h4><p>That has been another source of apprenticeship we have experienced. In the past, ­we believed it was better to do things by ourselves, alone. We did not collaborate with many other Peruvian companies, but we sought to establish agreements with European and US companies. We have now implemented a change related to our manner of understanding the so-called “new“ economy. We now possess a large number of partners in Latin America. In a sense, we have joined with our Latin brothers, including some of the most respected universities in Ecuador and Colombia, which are also excellent business schools. We have thus created a network of business schools in Latin America for ethics and other areas. Now, our approach is multi-stakeholder: this means that we constantly develop strategies in partnership with several professional organizations. Moreover, we have aligned ourselves with Peru 2021, the local chapter of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development. Finally, just like a bank does with fintech, we deemed important to establish partnerships with fintechs for small projects, where we have reached around 30% of our new offer for non-graduate programs in partnerships with start-ups.</p><h4>How can a more flexible working environment become implemented in Peru?</h4><p>Due to the particularities of the Peruvian market, it should be done from a bottom up approach. In our Peruvian reality, outside of the first two segments mentioned earlier, companies still have a hierarchical style, meaning that orders come from the top to the bottom. However, leaders need freedom to speak up and propose their visions and be able to implement the objectives they envisage. But more importantly, the business community and top management has to create a culture of trust and creativity promotion that enables leaders to put in practice their ideas and new processes to unlock their key to success.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2020?</h4><p>We have been experiencing significant growth over the past two years, since 2018, and we expect this year to experience our highest growth figure over the last two decades. This implies several opportunities for CENTRUM PUCP, which comprise continuously assessing the satisfaction of our students, as well as researching and looking for new ways to adapt our teaching to satisfy the needs of our clients that will face the challenges that the industry poses to them with the imminent arrival of the fourth industrial revolution. We continue to explore for new opportunities and new methods that can provide a holistic preparation of professionals with integrity that are skillful to face the changes they will be exposed to in the dynamic environment of business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>COVID-19 has spread across the world at an alarming pace, overwhelming healthcare systems and wreaking havoc on the global economy. How has COVID-19 impacted GSK Turkey's operations?</h4><p>As GSK Turkey, we are closely monitoring the situation, in close contact with government and health experts to ensure that we are reacting quickly and responsibly in response to expert and science-led advice. From the very first day, we took all the necessary actions as we seek to safeguard the health and wellbeing of all our employees and their families, limit the spread of the disease, and continue to make our products available to the patients that need them. Starting from March 16th, we have ceased all face-to-face promotion activities and our employees started to work from their home through our digital platforms. This situation, and the uncertainty we are all living with is incredibly difficult. We are a science-led global healthcare company with a special purpose: to help people do more, feel better, live longer. GSK's medicines treat a broad range of world's most common acute and chronic diseases; and the vaccines portfolio consists of more than 30 vaccines for every stage of life, helping to protect people from serious disease for well over 100 years. Therefore, we know very well our mission and what our company is here for, so we will do everything we can for the patients who depend on us. And we will do everything we can to support each other in these challenging times.</p><h4>All eyes are on pharmaceutical companies as the world rushes to find a vaccine for COVID-19. Broadly speaking, how does Turkey's healthcare landscape match with GSK's expertise in vaccines, as well as in other areas like respiratory care, HIV, and oncology?</h4><p>GSK is a world leader in vaccines—we have more than 30 vaccines in the market for 21 different diseases and 14 vaccines in development, which makes us an important player in that category. The Turkish market is not as developed for vaccines given its potential but is progressing to approximate the size of the European markets. Respiratory, Asthma, COPD and other respiratory conditions have a high prevalence in Turkey and are a huge priority for us in terms of public health, just like vaccines. Meanwhile, HIV is a key area for us as well. This is not just a health issue, but also carries a social stigma. We want patients to be aware of getting tested and getting the right treatment. For the future portfolio, we are excited about oncology. We want to make sure that we are active in this disease area and addressing high unmet needs. On the COVID-19 vaccine development side, we are contributing our science and expertise where we can have most impact. We are pleased to have started a collaboration with CEPI to make our vaccine adjuvant technology available to scientists with promising technology platforms or candidate vaccines to prevent the virus. The first organisation working with us under this framework with CEPI is the University of Queensland in Australia. We have also announced a further collaboration with Clover Biopharmaceuticals, based in China, to provide our adjuvant technology to support its COVID-19 vaccine research program.</p><h4>Looking at GSK's operational strategy in Turkey, around 62% of the medicines you supply are also manufactured locally. Can you give me a broad picture of your manufacturing network?</h4><p>We have achieved significant local manufacturing through strategic partnerships. These strategic partners produce roughly 62% - and will reach up to 74% following localization - of the roughly 80 million packs we supply to patients in Turkey. There are four local companies we partner with—some of them are more manufacturing-oriented, whereas others are strategic partners, meaning that required know-how and production capabilities are provided by GSK. These partnerships also allow us to be agile and flexible. We have also sought greenfield investments, but this is quiet challenging given that we have a very diverse and large portfolio— producing such extent in a market is not feasible or logistically viable. We have to focus on the partnerships we have established here and also find the right balance in terms of what can be imported and what can be produced locally.</p><h4>What is GSK's future strategy for exports from Turkey?</h4><p>Our vision is not only to localize but also to expand Turkey's global pharmaceutical footprint. We understand government's agenda to decrease the trade deficit and pharmaceuticals play a key role in this task. Thus, we are now analyzing what can be exported, when, and to which markets, and later on we would like to discuss with the government to understand when those opportunities could best be realized. Turkey boasts of a vital geographical location, and we need to seize its capabilities at its most.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges GSK is facing in its Turkish operations?</h4><p>Economic volatility over the past eight months was a challenge for us from a decision-making perspective, although we have now achieved stabilization. Our company has been present in the market for 60 years and is fully aware of the nature of doing business in Turkey. We strongly believe in the future of this country and its growth potential.</p><h4>What are GSK's most exciting initiatives in Turkey for 2020?</h4><p>Our primary plan is to expand our footprint in public healthcare—anything we can do to deliver vaccines and our medicines to the Turkish patients is our greatest reward. And meanwhile, in step with the government's growth agenda, we can play a role in supporting the national economy through localization, exportation and clinical trials.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>DP World Yarımca is slated to increase its capacity by 30% by the end of 1Q2020 through around USD50 million in investments. Can you outline the investment program?</h4><p>The USD50 million is as good as spent. We're increasing capacity from 900,000 TEU to 1.3 million TEU chiefly though investing in equipment. The largest share of this investment went towards ship-to-shore gantry cranes and yard handling equipment. The cranes have arrived on site and we are in the process of commissioning them, something that will be done by April 1, 2020. The next largest investment category is yard handling equipment such as robotized gantries (RTGs), which number six in total, and are due to be brought into use by March. We have also invested in internal transport vehicles (ITVs). By April 1, everything will be implemented and we will have the full 1.3 million TEU of capacity that we expect available.</p><h4></h4><h4><br></h4><h4>Counter to many figures emerging from Turkey's 2019 economic performance, DP World Yarımca posted strong year-end results. How did you manage strong growth during a down year?</h4><p>We saw 7.5% growth in 2019, a tough year which saw three consecutive quarters of negative economic growth in Turkey. Our growth was due largely to exports, which we saw grow more than 20% year-on-year. Another factor is the region that we serve within Turkey—which is more balanced in terms of exports and imports than other regions in Turkey. The region is highly industrialized, whereby much of our business is “inputs-for-export," as is the case for the automotive manufacturers that we serve. This runs contrary to terminals located on Istanbul's European side, which depend heavily on domestic consumption-driven imports, and that as a result saw a downturn in 2019. We are still impacted by domestic consumption, and we did see a slowdown in imports that are tied to domestic vehicle sales. More broadly, globalization is taking a bit of a hit, which is of course highly relevant for us.</p><h4>In 2019, a new rail line linking the Yarımca terminal to the broader regional rail network was completed. What upgrade does this rail line represent compared to previous infrastructure?</h4><p>Use of the new line has advanced more than we had anticipated. We introduced the line in July 2019 and exceeded our targets for the second half of the year. Turkey is a vast country and cries out for rail solutions. Historically, rail infrastructure has been quite good, but since the 60s and 70s it hasn't received the attention it needs and now pretty much all cargo is handled by truck. There's a huge truck fleet that operates at low cost, but regardless the large beneficial cargo lines (BCOs) prefer mass shipment. That's where our rail line plugs in — we can now reach those areas we couldn't reach before. There's a sustainability component as well — rail accounts for around 30% less carbon emissions than trucks — a consideration gaining relevance for large shippers. As such, I believe that more funds should flow into enhancing rail capabilities and enhancing some of the existing infrastructure. A prime example is the Kars-Tbilisi-Baku connection, which connects Turkey with the so-called “middle corridor" of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In turn, we are seeing demand for us to set up product routes from the CIS area and certain locations in China. This would connect the vital middle corridor to Istanbul and onward to the rest of Europe. DP World is already greatly involved in managing connections in the Caspian Sea region, and there are significant flows to and from this area. If we can containerize them and put them on a train, we'd have a highly sustainable solution.</p><h4><br></h4><h4>Which areas of DP World Yarımca's operations are you most excited about?</h4><p>I'm excited about enhancing and increasing our direct connections to BCOs. We have our trade enabling initiative, that is, we are obviously an operator, but we are presenting ourselves increasingly as a trade enabler. As a group, we have invested over USD2 billion in activities beyond our “core activity," or terminals, which has led to much momentum to connect directly to BCOs. That means connecting in the digital or physical medium all the way to the end user. I'm also excited about identifying opportunities to go further inland beyond our natural scope. We help to move cargo faster, safer and more cost-efficiently through the application of cutting-edge human expertise, innovation and technology. We give cargo owners better control through enhanced visibility through the supply chain. We continue to strengthen our core business of 'trade gateways' (ports/terminals, logistics partners) while diversifying into wider areas of the global supply chain, where disruptive technology is creating new opportunities. We are constantly diversifying into new but related sectors as we work to build both necessary physical infrastructure and a digital virtual platform. Innovation It is part of the company's cultural DNA and central to the Founder's Principles, as we adapt and evolve to drive results and create growth. Innovation is a critical driver of both past success and of future profitable growth. Facilitating global trade on the basis of the motto “Smarter trade, better future", DP World with its partners will start offering services including customs clearance, warehousing and transportation to and from the port in 2020, which helps make global supply chains efficient.</p><h4>What are your expectations and plans for 2020?</h4><p>The terminal will return to the double-digit growth figures we experienced prior to 2019. In our first full year of operations, we grew to over 400,000 TEUs, and we kept growing by 25% and 40% after that. We're working to target smaller trade lanes and our initiatives in reaching out to BCOs will start to yield as well. We're very excited about 2020 and 2021 after 2019, which was in many ways a difficult year. We've used this down year to begin investments and prepare for the boost that we expect in 2020. We're already off to a good start this year, and are excited about what's to come.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<title><![CDATA[15% of Moroccan Aviation Market]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[hans-van-de-velde-managing-director-tui-fly-morocco]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your current operations in Morocco?</h4><p>TUI Group is with 70,000 employees the largest travel company in Western Europe. We are a vertically integrated business. It is in our DNA to take care of the customer from A to Z. Morocco is a special country for TUI, not only because it is one of the main destinations in our portfolio, but also because it's the only destination where we have an airline. The other five airlines of TUI Group -located in Western Europe- create economies of scale that are very helpful when running these relatively small outfits, like we have in Morocco. In Morocco we have seen strong growth, between 5-8% a year, from Western Europe, where we have most of our operations. Our market share on the Europe-Morocco routes is stable at around 15%. Historically, we have been among the top three airlines in Morocco with Royal Air Maroc and Air Arabia. Now, actors like Ryanair and Transavia are growing while Royal Air Maroc is declining on these Western Europe routes. There is fierce competition in the Moroccan market: Royal Air Maroc still holds 35% market share on routes from Europe to Morocco. Ryanair and Transavia both have 15%, like us. Vueling and Easyjet are also active in Morocco, which is an interesting market for leisure airlines since it can be exploited the whole year through. If we compare this to i.e. the Greek market which completely shuts down between November and March (save Athens), it is more interesting. This is one of the reasons why TUI fly continues to increase flight frequencies to and from Morocco. In the last five years, the amount of flights has substantially increased. New routes are open and capacities are expanded. Some places here are now turning into major touristic places, for example Agadir. These places represent an opportunity for leisure airlines. Other airlines, with a focus on a hub-and-spoke model like Royal Air Maroc, logically have less focus on these typical point-to-point leisure routes. Consolidation and partnerships are key in aviation. Thanks to travel agents and tour operators selling our packages and seats in Morocco, our market share in Agadir is now 40 %. Tourism is of the utmost importance for several other destinations in Morocco, including Fez and Marrakesh, where TUI plays an important role.</p><h4>When flying to Morocco, what makes TUI fly stand out?</h4><p>First, as part of a major touristic group, we barely cancel any flights. It is in our DNA to always keep operations running as our customers are often booking an accommodation and a transfer in addition to the flights. Second, TUI played an important role in personalizing the flight experience by giving the client choice for what service he is willing to pay for. For example, if a passenger does not want a meal during his flight, he doesn't have to pay for it. With TUI fly you can pay for your luggage and meals separately. I am surprised that it is still seen as a low-value product. The majority of customers are not willing to pay for an all-inclusive flight. They prefer to tailor their flight to meet their needs, so for the price the clients pay, it's a tailored, high-value product.</p><h4>Key challenges for growth in the sector?</h4><p>The current situation in Morocco cannot last: it will become a battlefield. I do not know many markets where so many airlines are competing to gain market share. While the market is growing strongly, this can continue for a while, but this environment cannot last over time. Also, we will be following closely the government's approach to developing tourism. Infrastructure development in Morocco is good, although Casablanca is a good example of a city with huge potential that is underutilized, with regards to sun-and-beach tourism. Developments take place in some regions, such as Taghazout in the south. In the leisure segment, hotels and flights go hand in hand. Infrastructure development in Morocco is good. It would be helpful for Morocco to also focus on outgoing tourism in addition to the incoming aspect. There is good amount of Moroccans with the means and will to travel. By investing in outgoing tourism (for example, looking at visa procedures) more dynamism around traveling is created. This will also reinforce Morocco as a destination.</p><h4>What role does sustainability play in your business model?</h4><p>We should distinguish two things: on the one hand, we benefit from being a part of TUI airlines, which has a very young fleet. The technology we use to operate our flights has less impact by being more fuel efficient. TUI group is carrying out tests to become even more environment-friendly, for example by separating waste on board, by removing all unnecessary plastic items on board. On the other hand, we have several initiatives in Morocco. We are helping a company in Marrakesh to develop cycling tourism, offering guided bike tours of the city; it is called the Pikala Project. We have another project in Agadir tackling education, environment, and sustainability problems. Tourism brings a lot of wealth to the world as well as a lot of value for individuals, but tourism is a tricky subject at the moment. Morocco is a good example that without tourism the economy would be in a much different state and the population would be affected. A well-developed country can spend a bigger budget on sustainability. As an airline, we try to be as environment friendly as possible.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ifeanyi-chukwuma-odii-founder-ceo-ultimus-holdings]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does your current portfolio of investments look like?</h4><p>Ultimus is currently active in construction, property development, and trading. Our trading business currently focused on ambiance fittings is promoted under the brand name “The ClassRoom“ which offers a range of exceptional and premium lighting, bathroom, kitchen, and paint product. We have partnered with some of the leading European brands in each product category that brings decades of product leadership and quality. We currently have a property development called Parla Di Lusso located in Banana Island is poised to be the most elegant and magnificent composition of villas in the heart of the most prestigious estate in West Africa. Parla Di Lusso will be giving our prospective customers the finest of Luxury at the best cost value as we leverage on our strength in procurement through our trading company. The development promises to provoke a new vista of experiential living, above and beyond expectation. Our goal for the property development arm is to build 10,000 houses within a five-year period which will cut across all economic class and over 50% of the developments will be focused on affordable housing.</p><h4>Is there still a gap in affordable housing in the Nigerian market?</h4><p>Of course, there is. In Nigeria, there is currently an approximate housing deficit of 20 million and as I said earlier, our projection is 10,000 housing units across all economic class categories in five years. Ultimus is actively taking on these building projects because we are committed to making lives better for Nigerians and society at large. Creating affordable housing that cuts across every economic class will ensure that fewer people have a housing problem. As much as we want to make a profit in the near future, we will address the socio-economic challenge first.</p><h4>What other investment interests does Ultimus Holdings have?</h4><p>We have six major investment sector focus. The sectors which have not been mentioned are agriculture, hospitality, financial services, and ICT. These are areas growing massively and of course some more than the other but; we are assiduously mapping our investment strategy with data. The aim for us is to grow our businesses organically and consolidate them as sustainable investments.</p><h4>What is your opinion on the current investment climate and business sentiment in Nigeria? </h4><p>Nigeria has the largest economy in Africa and is rich in natural resources and human capital. However as every country has its own challenges, Nigeria is not exempt. More can be done by the government in terms of power and infrastructure development as these two are critical to the ease of doing business in Nigeria.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2020?</h4><p>We expect that in 2020 most of Ultimus Group's current investments will record increased revenue growth as we consolidate and focus on market penetration to increase our market share and brand visibility. We hope the government will create policies that will enable our businesses to thrive. We are extremely optimistic that the year 2020 holds great promise for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[regenerative-medicine]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you briefly summarize the medical environment that gave rise to Clí­nica Vertebra and WIP?<br></strong>In the last few decades, surgery has changed significantly mainly been due to advancements in both optics and the control of imaging inside operating rooms. Additionally, doctors are seeking less aggressive surgical practices. In parallel, there was the development of two new specialties: interventional pain specialty and a minimally invasive approach to spine surgery. Furthermore, the development of anesthesia played a major role. It gave us an opportunity to change classical surgery by shortening the duration of operations. At the same time, many older surgical approaches were not acceptable for an aging population because of the complication rate, the severity of the surgery, and the risk limitations. We have been providing new surgical approaches with minimally invasive attitudes and approaches, including endoscopy. These solutions made the population much less dependent on pharmacology and helped avoid issues like the prescription opioid epidemic.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about your international operations?<br></strong>WIP is a global organization. We provide our colleagues an opportunity to learn new procedures and new ways of safely treating patients. Our first site was in Budapest, and we later added operations in Miami and Texas. We also moved to Taipei and will start providing Mandarin-based education in 2020. We are also planning to expand into Istanbul. We later plan to move from Istanbul to Central Asian and Middle Eastern countries and the Gulf. Our most important concern is the alleviation of pain and suffering for our patients.</p><p><strong>What percentage of Clí­nica Vertebra's patients is international, and how do you attract them?<br></strong>Over 10% is international, which is reasonable. We can provide them with special services such as hosting and personal assistance. We are a multi-lingual team. Usually, our patients refer other patients to us. For now, we are focusing on quality over growth.</p><p><strong>How many patients do you receive per year?<br></strong>We see over 2,000 new patients per year. All our patients receive extremely high-quality and reliable service. This is the most important thing for us, starting from the first meeting with the patient all the way until their trip back home.</p><p><strong>Who are your main competitors?<br></strong>We compete with ourselves. Through self-criticism, we are always working to improve our services, quality, and the outcomes we produce. We have a great team, a strong approach to innovation, and a focus on quality management. It is not easy for a company to persevere for decades. This is especially true in a space such as ours, where change and innovation happen rapidly.</p><p><strong>Do you see a disparity between university curricula and the needs of the medical field?<br></strong>We need to support scientific advancement; this is one of the most remarkable areas of social advancement. Our clinic has contributed significantly at international forums in advancing the state of the field. We have engaged with thousands of practitioners interested in learning. We have given many local symposia and forums.</p><p><strong>Can you give us an example of new techniques in operating rooms?<br></strong>There are many. We are working on regenerative medicine with the introduction of stem cells in the spine. We are also working on a new technique that utilizes LR-PRP, and we are among the first in the world to use it. We are publishing the first open, double blind, and randomized controlled trial on the application for complex derivative pain conditions.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>The main objective is to be as effective as possible and to relieve disability for our patients. We want to keep people as healthy and whole as possible for as long as possible. We have a moral obligation to provide effective, costless solutions that extend the human lifespan. We are at the beginning of a new era of regenerative medicine. It has and will continue to be a major advancement in medicine.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How are you integrating technology into your business? <br></strong>We were the first ones to acquire technology that supposes a disruptive scientific innovation both for the diagnosis and treatment of patients. We are the second center in Spain to implement a PET, and we will also be the second to implement a proton accelerator in Madrid. We didn't establish our headquarters in Madrid solely because of international patients; our patients from Madrid and southern Spain asked us to be closer, especially for certain treatments that do not require hospitalization. Previously, people would have to go to Pamplona to receive certain oncological treatments that require hospitalization, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy. We needed to be in other location besides Navarra to be more accessible for patients. The location of the site in Madrid is convenient because it is close to the airport, meaning we can serve foreign patients. This site is aimed more at fast treatments whereas Pamplona is for slower, more complex treatments.</p><p><strong>How important is research for the Clí­nica Universidad de Navarra? <br></strong>Even when we were small, the medical school had basic research laboratories. As part of the university, the Clí­nica is a non-profit organization and its mission is to generate knowledge, research, and innovation. Thanks to our group of researchers and scientists, we have managed to build the center, attract more researchers, and start the project. We ask our professionals to question and study the reasons why diseases arise, how they can be addressed, and which biological mechanisms are involved. We have strategic alliances and collaborations. We are rigorous with data records and administrative data management. We have also launched some of our clinical trials through the funding of competitive calls from both Europe and the Carlos III Institute in Spain. We have a good track record in international research, which makes it easier for young researchers to form and develop their projects. </p><p><strong>What is the future of AI and robots in the medical sector?<br></strong>Robotic surgery is an innovation that we have incorporated because scientific evidence shows that it is good for patients. It is a controversial and expensive innovation but it offers better results. We use robotic surgery in urology, thoracic surgery, gynecology, general surgery, and other specialties. In Pamplona, we are developing surgical simulation centers. Surgeons in residence are required to have a certain number of hours of simulation before entering the operating room. Big data is also going to be important. There are AI tools that can diagnose more accurately than a radiologist. AI will not substitute for a radiologist, but it can make the work much easier.</p><p><strong>How difficult is it to attract and retain human talent?<br></strong>We train 200 medical students and 150 nursing students annually. We have 175 medical residents in Pamplona. We cannot compete with other institutions regarding salary because we are an educational institution, but we offer other advantages. We offer an academic project where professionals are free to develop their professional career in ways they do not have in other places. We offer technological means, the possibility of participating in research projects, and academic support platforms that help professionals in their investigations. Professionals are even free to care for patients without time constraints, so they can offer the best of their knowledge and time. This differentiates us from other health institutions.</p><p><strong>What are your goals for 2020?<br></strong>In 1Q2020, we will open the proton therapy facility. We will continue working with international hospitals, including John Hopkins. We are working on a publication to show the benefits of proton therapy. We want to grow between 20% and 25% in Madrid. We also want to continue growing in Pamplona. One of our goals is to ensure that growth in Madrid does not affect the Pamplona site. We are also digitalizing our operations, which will help us give more value to our patients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of Mundipharma?<br></strong>Mundipharma is a mid-sized, fully integrated pharmaceutical company whose purpose is to move medicine forward. It is privately owned, and the network has a presence in well over 120 countries worldwide, employing thousands of people, 2,000 of them in Europe. Mundipharma has managed to grow over the years by delivering commercial excellence with a diversified portfolio that has been accessed through strategic partnerships with other companies in areas like biosimilars, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Today, Mundipharma in Europe is a leader in the commercialization of biosimilars and is a reference commercial partner in specialist driven primary care. In 2015, we launched infliximab, the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar. In 2018, sales of our biosimilars had grown in excess of EUR350 million, and we are proud to have contributed to saving healthcare systems more than EUR800 million over that period. Moreover, it is particularly fulfilling and fitting with our purpose that these biosimilars allow thousands of patients to have access to innovative biologic treatments that were not accessible to them for costs reasons. Through its commercial partnership with Celltrion, Mundipharma is today the European biosimilar market leader with infliximab, rituximab, and trastuzumab, and our recent acquisition of Cinfa Biotech has enabled our successful expansion into development and commercialization across Europe. Similarly, our strategic partnerships with Janssen and Vectura in diabetes and respiratory recognize our ability to tailor our market access and commercial propositions to every market in order to deliver a competitive performance in a complex primary care environment.</p><p><strong>Can you tell us more about your business model?<br></strong>Our business model is based upon three key pillars: innovation, commercial excellence, and partnerships. In terms of innovation, the company is focused on medicines that can bring real value to patients and healthcare providers and assets that we can be proud of developing and commercializing. In terms of commercial excellence, as a specialty company we have the local understanding of our customers' needs and the footprint and capabilities that enables us to move quickly, adapt, and establish our commercial platforms in new markets. This agility provides a competitive advantage, allowing us to execute competitively and cost effectively, as we have recently proven in biosimilars and diabetes. And both innovation and commercial excellence can only happen through fostering strong partnerships: partnerships with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies that see in Mundipharma their partner in development or commercialization of innovative assets; partnerships with our customers, healthcare professionals, and healthcare providers that entrust Mundipharma's professionalism and commitment to move medicine forward together; and partnerships internally within the organization and with our shareholders so that we truly operate as one, with clear direction and focus. Our ambition is to continue to grow with a portfolio of innovative assets through in-licensing and co-development. We invest a great deal in human capital development to create a high-performing and learning environment for everyone in the organization, and this continues to be recognized by our employees. We have received Great Place to Work awards across Europe. Mundipharma is a great place to grow for high-performing individuals who want to take ownership, demonstrate accountability, and make a real impact on the business to move medicine forward.</p><p><strong>How do you assess the attractiveness of the Spanish pharmaceutical industry for foreign investors?<br></strong>Spain is already one of the major suppliers of high-quality medicines in Europe, and Brexit provides an opportunity for Spanish manufacturing operations to step up in this area. Mundipharma recognized this excellence by acquiring Cinfa Biotech in 2018, and in the past few months we have strengthened our partnerships with ROVI and 3P to launch a pegfilgrastim biosimilar fully developed in Spain across Europe. Our partnership with ESTEVE in the development of new molecules to target novel pain receptors is also testament to our belief in the potential of the Spanish pharmaceutical<br>industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How have your insulin products evolved throughout the years?<br></strong>There have been some major milestones. In the beginning, it was about making the insulin as pure as possible, though over the years, we have innovated. Insulin from more than 50 years ago is still used significantly in a large part of the world, including Europe. The entire paradigm of the modern generation of insulin is to reduce complications. Insulin behaves differently in people's bodies; therefore, we have to develop insulin that can mimic the physiological profile of one's body. We are innovating by bringing new insulin that is safer and better. If we talk about national healthcare, the biggest burden is the cost of complications and not necessarily the cost of medicine. With the current working environment, many people have shifting working conditions, so having predictable insulin has a big influence on production. These are fundamental to ensure one can live a normal life while having diabetes. This is why we continue to innovate in this space because there is still room to grow in terms of offering solutions to patients.</p><p><strong>Regarding recent innovations as Fiasp, how is this product differentiated from other products?<br></strong>Fiasp is a rapid insulin that one takes during mealtimes. In the past, one had to take insulin up to 30 minutes before eating, but now they can take it up to five minutes after they eat because the insulin is rapid and normalizes their blood sugar after they eat. This is an extremely convenient factor in creating flexibility and lowers the blood sugar level. That is why it is extremely important: it helps mimic the physiological profile. This is innovative not only for type 1 diabetes, but also for patients with type 2 diabetes. It is extremely important that people can live a normal life with the growing population today. More than 13% of the Spanish population has diabetes, and many of them live with it unknowingly.</p><p><strong>What commercial hurdles did the company face during its diversification phase?<br></strong>Novo Nordisk has been great at focusing on the core business. We focus on a specific type of molecule. We are second to none in R&amp;D because we are successful at what we are doing, and we are continuously progressing with this. We have more than 1,000 other collaborations around the world in terms of molecular development and new technologies, including with MIT. The way we look at the molecules are not that different from an R&amp;D point of view. Saving lives and treating diabetes through innovation is a new paradigm shift in the industry. It all comes down to our stated values to cure diabetes. That is why we invest billions of euros every year in new molecules; we want to come up with a cure at Novo Nordisk. Healthcare is an issue for all countries and should be tackled globally. The Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, societies, and patient organizations ought to come together to find the right solutions for patients to have the right medications at the right time and for the right reasons. It will be a difficult task to convince policymakers and politicians to invest in the long term.</p><p><strong>What are your objectives for the coming year in Spain?<br></strong>Novo Nordisk will be a partner in delivering insulin, GLP-1, and other types of treatments for patients who need them. My goal is to move the needle to make diabetes a key priority for the authorities. The patients and society deserve better focus. It is not to take away the focus on cancer; if we look at the facts, we are simply uninvested in diabetes. The amount of amputations in Spain is extremely high because of bad control. In quality of care, it is extremely important we address this from a societal point of view. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How has Eugin evolved over the years?<br></strong>Eugin started as a small clinic in Barcelona and its founders soon realized that it was hard to penetrate the local market. This led them to look into France and Italy. At that time, Spain had more open regulations than those two countries with regards to assisted reproduction, meaning patients in Spain could receive treatments that were not available elsewhere. Our founders dedicated their efforts to opening up the other markets and, as a result, our operations grew rapidly. Then, ProA Capital, based in Madrid, acquired part of Eugin. In 2012, it started a professionalization process, turning the clinic into a company. The company made acquisitions in Colombia, Spain, and Italy. Subsequently, a group called NMC Health, based in Abu Dhabi and listed on the London Stock Exchange, invested in the company and took over 90% of the group. Since then, we have grown to some 75 clinics in 15 countries across four continents, with 1,500 doctors and embryologists and over 42,000 treatments per year. We will soon be number-one in the global market.</p><p><strong>What does your marketing plan involve?<br></strong>We have acquired a number of clinics in different countries. This is not a large industry, so when one wants to grow, it has to be internationally. When we make acquisitions, we go for clinics that are not that big. We have been doing this rapidly, and it is now time to consolidate our growth. We are creating assets at a group level, such as our brand, an IP policy, Eugin Education, an IT system, and more. We have five initiatives at the moment and are working to create the above-mentioned assets to support all our clinics. In the future, our growth will be driven more through greenfield openings and not so much through acquisitions.</p><p><strong>What is the role of Eugin Education?<br></strong>One of the key things in the health sector is addressing the future needs of our patients. By creating the education program, we provide society with training that is not currently available. We teach how to manage new technologies, such as genetic testing or robotics. Moreover, by offering educational programs we can select the best talent and incorporate it into our company.</p><p><strong>What is the future of health tourism?<br></strong>We prefer to talk in terms of cross-border healthcare, and yes, indeed, it will disappear over time. In Europe, regulations are increasingly opening up. This means that patients will not travel if they do not need to. The healthcare industry needs to bring the treatment to wherever the patient is. At the same time, governments around the world are also tightening their grip on the sector. This means companies that have the proper reporting and controls in place will have an easier time when it comes to sharing information with governments.</p><p><strong>What special features will your new facilities have?<br></strong>In the health industry, everyone is becoming patient-centric. Recently, we have sat on the other side and asked patients what they want. We have a new 7,000-sqm facility in Barcelona, with two floors, one for a lab and one for our patients. We are investing a great deal in this new layout to completely change the way we operate. We are building 33 nests, which are basically rooms with a sofa, fridge, TV, and consultation room. The patients will stay there, and all procedures will take place in this room. We want patients to feel as comfortable as possible.</p><p><strong>What opportunities do you see in Spain?<br></strong>As other countries open up regulations, less and less international patients will come to Spain for treatment. Instead of exporting treatments, we can export technology. This is not just limited to medicine, but treatments, genetic testing, nutrition, psychology, and more. Making this a part of a comprehensive treatment is how we can progress. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>UB is an emblem of education in the region and ranks highly in the Academic Ranking of World Universities, QS World University Rankings, and Best Global Universities, among others. Can you tell us about the university's origins and evolution? </strong></p><p>UB is one of the leading educational institutions in Spain and Latin America. This is a result of the university's strength as an institution and its research capabilities. Of all the scientific publications by Spanish researchers, 11.3% correspond to UB authors and 32.3% to all Catalonian authors. Our position is especially strong in the fields of life sciences, biomedicine, neurosciences, and natural sciences, as well as in scientific areas of humanities such as philosophy, archaeology, and social sciences. The university's commitment to society is not strictly limited to academic training for professionals and experts; our strategic goal has always been to become a research-intensive university. We are one of the pioneers in southern Europe when it comes to evaluating research in all our centers, departments, and units, and introducing systems of indicators and international models that have an impact on management and decision-making. Apart from the general research evaluating processes in Spain, we have our own evaluation system that follows international standards. The synergy between the quality of our researchers and our research policy has always been the differentiating factor. The university is committed to the valuation of its teaching and research staff and the recruitment of top PhD students. We are proud to maintain this position despite having a weak funding system.</p><p><br>UB engages in a considerable number of international projects. How does the university grow its visibility abroad? <br>One of UB's biggest challenges in Europe is carrying out the coordination and leadership of the alliance with CHARM European University (CHARM-EU). The objective of CHARM-EU is to create a European university with a focus on conflict resolution, the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the theme 'Reconciling Humanity with the Planet.' The idea is to create an inclusive and diverse university with research-based methodologies. Among the actions we have in mind is the creation of the University Internationalization Hub in collaboration with the European University Foundation (EUF). The hub will promote initiatives aimed at the modernization of the higher education space in Europe, carrying out projects that influence the policies of the new EU Erasmus program. Moreover, within the Erasmus mobility framework outside the EU, we designed a new mobility policy based on UB's commitment to SDGs in countries such as Senegal, India, and Vietnam.</p><p><strong>Central to the university's success is its commitment to research, with over EUR133,000 invested in research and technology transfer. How is research and innovation fostered at UB? </strong><br>The university is strongly committed to research and it is by far the leading university in Spain and possibly in the entire Iberian and Latin American regions. This is particularly remarkable as we are a university that offers a wide range of subjects, from the Sumerian language to microsatellite design. Despite that, we have a number of areas of focus. These areas are biomedicine (including clinical practice), neurosciences, archaeology, digital humanities, pharmacy, nutrition, marine sciences, water and environment, complex systems, physics and astrophysics, bioengineering, and biochemistry. We give priority to sustainability and areas where we can play a leading role. We participate as a partner in several joint institutes, mostly focused on biomedicine. The university has identified some areas which are experiencing a decline, partly due the retirement of key personnel, but also due to insufficient funding. Two such key areas are genetics and materials science and nanoscience. Moving forward, our priority is to promote research in these fields. Notably, given the size and scope of our university, there is much to gain from transversal and truly cross-disciplinary lines of research. So far, we have identified three such areas, namely AI, climate and environment, and science and politics. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>How did the GBSB Global Business School start?<br></strong>The school was founded by Olga Ivanova, who holds a master's degree and PhD in education. A key quality the market is expecting from graduates nowadays is a capacity to innovate and propose creative solutions. Olga is a pioneer in defining ways to ensure that students graduating from a business school acquire such competencies. She developed her own teaching methodology, which focuses on enhancing the innovation capacity of business students and finding ways to measure the impact of this methodology. In 2018, Olga received a prestigious award for her research from the Universitat Autí²noma de Barcelona. Building this methodology required studying different teaching methods and approaches, which in itself was innovative. Her research forms the basis of GBSB Global Business School's philosophy.</p><p><strong>How do you define global education?<br></strong>We have students from more than 85 countries and faculty members from around 30 countries. This diversity is one of our core values. It is also something our students appreciate as it allows them to learn from each other and build a valuable global network.</p><p><strong>What does the partnership with Microsoft mean for the school?<br></strong>I have worked my whole life as a strategic consultant specialized in technology. When I joined three years ago, the first thing we did was improve the digital experience. We partnered with Microsoft because of its worldwide educational division, which provided us with the possibility to implement digital technologies. If you meet certain requirements, you can become a Microsoft Showcase School, which is what we are. What Microsoft offers is an ecosystem that makes students' lives easier. Every student is provided with not only an email account, but with a Windows 10 license and Microsoft Office pack. We encourage students to receive Microsoft Office certifications. There are two levels of certifications: specialist and expert. We are the only business school that does this in Spain. At GBSB, all interactions between faculty members and students are managed by a Microsoft application called Microsoft Teams for Education. This includes mobile and desktop apps which can be used to upload teaching materials, hold discussions, upload assignments, and access real-time information about classes and grades. This represents one of the major steps we took for the implementation of new digital processes.</p><p><strong>What is the future of Spain's education sector?<br></strong>One of the key criticisms that institutions receive is the lack of pace in adapting to the demands of the labor market. Three years ago, we did not have digital-related programs, and today we have programs for digital business, digital marketing, and even fintech. It is vital to have these skills today as most students will launch a digital business rather than an industrial, traditional one. It is also becoming more necessary to provide students with access to capsule trainings and mock training. Distance learning is also a common and growing trend. Our online programs have been growing at a high rate as student bodies are becoming diversified and life-long learning is becoming a norm.</p><p><strong>What are your main objectives for 2020?<br></strong>Our main objective is to generate opportunities for our students. For example, we have a job portal with offers from more than 180 countries. It uses AI algorithms to aggregate job offers for specific sectors. In 2018, we founded the G-Accelerator program for students who have an entrepreneurial idea. As part of this program, students are provided with an infrastructure and mentoring services to start their own business. The main objective is to develop the project within six months so that it's mature enough to be pitched to investors. We started with one project in January 2019, which turned out to be a great success. So far, we have partnered with different local and international partners like Crowdcube, Enpact, APTKI, and Marinel-lo. The networking connections we provide are crucial. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about IESE Business School's origins and evolution since 1958?<br></strong><span></span>IESE Business School was established in 1958 and was among the first of its kind. We started with programs for senior executives. The first program we offered was an advanced management program for owners and senior executives of mid-sized, family-owned businesses in Barcelona. IESE Business School has grown since then, and today we have campuses in Madrid, Barcelona, Munich, New York, and Sío Paulo. We have grown from offering senior executive education programs to MBAs and master's management programs. In fact, we started the first MBA program in Europe in 1964, and today our MBA program has students from around 60 countries—25% from Asia, 35% from Europe, 17% from North America, and 23% from Latin America. We have 115 full time faculty members from about 30 countries. Spain is in a completely different situation than when we started. Today, the country is a flourishing democracy, and we have been able to grow from being an educational start-up in Barcelona to a broad multinational operation in the education space.</p><p><strong>What is your strategy for attracting international students and do your collaborations and offices in Asia play a role in this?<br></strong>Our offices definitely play a role. With people on the ground, we are able to better explain our offering to students. Our MBA program is international. This is attractive to prospective students. Through our programs, we provide students with opportunities to start their own businesses. Students are also interested in the strong emphasis we put on purpose and values. From the beginning, IESE Business School has had a clear purpose to play an important role in society. We believe that business leaders need to understand what their responsibilities are.</p><p><strong>IESE Business School's MBA program was named the top full-time MBA program globally by The Economist in 2018. Is there something specific about Spain that attracts international students?</strong><br>Spain has been able to develop world-class institutions over the past 60 years. Some other comparable economies in Europe have not been able to do this for many reasons. When you combine Spain's sights with education and business experience, it makes Spain an attractive proposition for international students.</p><p><strong>How does IESE Business School interact with the private sector?<br></strong>We are close to the private sector in several ways. We help companies find talent. At the same time, we interact with the private sector in our role as a provider of executive education to senior corporate executives. At the corporate level, we also offer customized executive education. We are one of the biggest providers in this space. We have a good sense of what is going on in various sectors. At our Madrid campus, we also offer a program for senior civil servants.</p><p><strong>IESE Business School has had a collaboration with Harvard Business School for over 50 years. What role does this collaboration play?</strong><br>At the time, we were trying to improve our ability to teach through the case method, which Harvard was already using. Several Harvard faculty members were part of the academic team that launched our MBA program in 1964. We currently offer two senior executive programs jointly with them. One is at our Barcelona campus, and the other is run in different parts of the world.</p><p><strong>What challenges and opportunities do you see in the near future?<br></strong>Technology is bringing changes in the workplace environment and new companies and business models are being built. One of the clear trends is that people will need to educate themselves even more than in the past. Education will become more flexible and lifelong learning will become a need and reality. This is a great opportunity for the education sector, because it is there to meet these kinds of needs. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>2018 was a politically complicated year for Spain. How would you evaluate the government's recent performance, and what would you highlight as the main achievements of your ministry?<br></strong>Indeed, it has taken 15 months of intense work to rebuild democratic institutions after the previous government's serious cases of corruption and to place equity at the center of public policies after a crisis and cuts that deepened social differences. The current government is doing things differently. We have prioritized dialogue as a way to resolve conflicts and encourage respect for democratic institutions. In terms of education, we came from a hard position of cuts, ineffective and unfair education models, and significant neglect. Public spending on education fell from 4.4% of GDP in 2011 to 3.89% in 2018, while the number of students increased. For this reason, the new government passed a law that repealed the main cuts of the conservative government, which had increased the ratio of students per classroom by 20% and raised the minimum number of teaching hours. The second major step was the government's approval of the draft education law to repeal the law that contained harmful measures and was questioned by the international educational consensus. The new law modernizes the system with the development of five strategic axes: children's rights, personalization of education, gender equity, education for sustainability, and education in the digital era. We aim to make vocational training the crown jewel of the Spanish education system. To this end, we developed a strategic plan for vocational training, which I presented, alongside the president, to business and union organizations. The production sector is experiencing a true digital revolution, and we need a new system to meet the new demands of the labor market. We are approving new titles and specialization courses and incorporating modules for all the productive sectors. Finally, we initiated processes of study and participation in two fundamental themes: the reinforcement and improvement of the teaching career and to ensure the full integration of those who have special educational or financial needs.</p><p><strong>The vast majority of companies highlight the retention of human talent, especially with technological training, as their main challenge. What strategy is the ministry following to address this situation and include technological training in the school curriculum?</strong><br>The current digital revolution is drastically changing the educational and formative context. This transformation implies a new way of understanding talent, because it is changing the way we build knowledge. The necessary transformations in the education system will be both organizational and pedagogical and impact all stages and teachings, from early childhood education to high school, vocational training, and lifelong learning. To address the talent challenge, we will launch actions aimed at developing the digital competence of teachers, students, and education centers. In addition, in a meaningful and universal way, we have to launch actions to boost STEM training. It is especially important to incorporate women into these trainings to combat the gender gap. We will promote a state framework, aligned with the European Digital Competition Framework, capable of ensuring that young people and their teachers acquire the digital competence they need.</p><p><strong>What are the objectives and priorities of the ministry for 2020?<br></strong>First, we will promote the new education law. We will develop a strategy of digitalization as one of the levers of effective economic and social transformation of the education system and its components. We will establish a school of AI under the ministry. In addition, we will design 80 new FP offers, associated, among others, with smart manufacturing, maintenance, digitalization, cybersecurity, AI, big data, virtual and augmented reality, collaborative robotics, autonomous vehicles, and cloud computing. We will increase the number of scholarships and reform the study aid system to ensure no one is left behind. We will modernize the basic school curriculum, so as to ensure comprehensive training and the development of key student competencies. For this purpose, we will create an institute for curriculum development and educational innovation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been the main achievements of Acesur?<br></strong>What sets Acesur apart from other olive oil companies is its focus on exports. At present, more than 50% of our turnover comes from exports. We sell in more than 100 different countries. What also sets us apart is the fact that we are extremely integrated along the entire chain. We manage 1,000ha of olive plantations. We are able to offer food-traced olive oil to our largest customers in Australia, the US, China, Japan, and the UK.</p><p><strong>What regions are of specific interest to you in terms of expanding your brand?<br></strong>We have a major opportunity to grow in the US market as well as China, Taiwan, and other parts of Southeast Asia. At the same time, we aim to consolidate our position in northern Europe, namely Ireland, the UK, Germany, and France.</p><p><strong>What is the role of the public sector in helping Spanish companies achieve international recognition?<br></strong>I do not think we can expect much from the public sector; this is something we have to do ourselves. Looking at Spanish olive oil brands in the world, volumes have multiplied by 10 as compared to 25 years ago. Production in Italy, however, has remained stable. 25 years ago, we were not in the EU, and it was not possible to sell packed olive oil easily outside of Spain. Meanwhile, Italy was part of the EU, which meant Italian companies became more experienced than Spanish companies; however, for the past four or five years, Spain has exported more packed olive oil than Italy. Italian brands are stronger and have a larger presence, but we are catching up in terms of quality, branding, and marketing.</p><p><strong>Acesur has invested in Triple Extra, which is a new control process. Can you tell us more about it?<br></strong>This is part of our vision to be the most honest and transparent olive oil company in the world. Every bottle of extra virgin olive oil that we produce is checked and approved by official, independent laboratories according to strict physical, chemical, and organoleptic standards. Olive oil is the only food product that must abide by an organoleptic taste law, and it is extremely complicated. Worldwide, this law has created somewhat of a mess. The sector is fighting to change this law or make it more objective. We send samples to two independent taste labs that give us the okay through detailed results and a certificate. We also analyze the physical chemicals and offer customers food traceability so they can understand where the olive oil came from, the types of olives it was made from, and how it was produced. This is something exclusive to Acesur.</p><p><strong>Does your intention to diversify into solid oils represent a change in the market?<br></strong>The reason why solid oils, for example, are becoming more popular is because people are moving away from palm oil. We see big demand for new solutions, since we are the largest oil distributing company in Spain. We have a patented solution to solidify oil in a natural way. We can offer solidified extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, or refined olive oil, as well as a blend of different vegetable oils. This is great for factories that produce pastries, ice cream, cookies, and other products. Our brand is called Olinostrum, and we are working together with other factories to test it and improve it. It is still too early, though we are on the right track. We are also investing in sauces and vinegars, as well as other dressings.</p><p><strong>What are your main objectives for 2020?<br></strong>We have a clear strategic plan that focuses on increasing our exports. We want 60% of our turnover to be sourced from exports. One of our large projects is to increase our vertical integration. By 2025, our goal is to have 50% of our needs produced and controlled by us. Today, that figure stands at 25%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>What have been Grupo Tragsa's main achievements since its creation in 1977?<br></strong>We don't submit tenders and we're not in the market. We don't set our prices; the Spanish government does it for us by means of a cost recovery scheme. We don't earn profits; we only recover the costs of the projects that are entrusted to us. We are, therefore, an extension of the government itself. If you look at the elements that have characterized rural transformation in Spain over the last 40 years, it's easy to find traces of Tragsa's presence. Our mission is to implement public policies related to rural, environmental, and land sustainability. This is how we have been able to occupy a relatively stable position in this field, without impacting the private sector and always limiting ourselves to public service management. At present, we are probably the only Spanish public enterprise that belongs simultaneously to the state, the autonomous communities, and the provincial councils.</p><p><strong>Do any of the tenders you submit abroad conflict with the interests of other Spanish companies?<br></strong>Conceptually, as a government institution, Grupo Tragsa should never compete with other Spanish companies in the international arena. We have actually relinquished this capacity, and it has been ratified by the government. That said, in some cases we do promote or facilitate internationalization by contributing our know-how and experience to the value chain, but only when it's officially requested of us. We've been requested by Spanish companies to collaborate with them in bids outside Spain, but we must be prudent and responsible. To join forces with Tragsa isn't just a question of bearing the Tragsa seal; it's also about bearing the seal of the Kingdom of Spain. This, along with our usual commitment, is an additional responsibility for us. We must not forget that we are spending public money.</p><p><strong>Which is your most significant project?<br></strong>It is difficult to identify one single project out of all the projects that we have undertaken in the past 40 years. The control system for agricultural activity in Spain we are currently developing is one of our technological highlights. It's a system that uses information from observation satellites to display the agricultural activities of farmers who receive European Commission subsidies in real-time. Tragsa's participation in the conversion of almost half of the 3.7 million ha in Spain from dry to irrigated land is another highlight. We help to develop areas with possibilities. We are dedicated to evaluating the needs of rural areas. Spain has a population imbalance; the rural areas are rapidly emptying, and we still haven't been able to come to terms with this. In this scenario, one of our goals is to see to what extent Tragsa can propose measures to mitigate the consequences of this population drain.</p><p><strong>Many people think that Spanish public companies have fallen behind when it comes to innovation. Is it true?<br></strong>At Grupo Tragsa, we conduct a lot of research in areas related to our field, such as the rural environment, rural technology, rural digitalization, and agriculture technology, and more. In 2018 alone, we invested more than EUR3 million in 27 innovation projects. In this regard, I can say that we are at the vanguard of technology and the leaders in this sector. In fact, when somebody wants to make a technological investment in these areas, they consult with us. </p><p><strong>What are your goals for the coming years?<br></strong>The main goal is to assume the responsibility of what we are. This means that we must establish ourselves as the government's agent. Second, it means clearly defining the limits of the company. In 2018, we earned around EUR800 million. We have no expansive plans. We want to be a bigger in-house provider in order to better respond to the needs of the country. Third, we want to keep our activities within the traditional sectors where we are already well known and where there's demand for work. Finally, we would like to maintain this difficult feat of neither making profits nor losses. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Can you tell us about Bollo's history and evolution?<br></strong>Bollo International Fruits is a family business that was created by my grandfather in 1922. We initially sold fruit that was produced in Valencia's Valldigna valley. The greatest challenge for any business is to be fair to everyone: consumers, providers, employees, and the environment. In 2018, we sold 180 million kilos of oranges, melons, watermelons, lemons, avocado, grapefruit, stone fruits, and a wide range of tropical fruits. We are the world's largest producer of the Santa Claus melon. We are looking to incorporate more fruits and increase avocado sales by starting our own production. It is important for us that the final consumer gets the same type of quality throughout the year. Around 16 years ago, we internationalized our production by establishing Bollo Brazil. Today, about 30,000 tons of melons travel from Brazil to Spain.</p><p><span></span><strong>Is any of your production in Brazil sold in the Latin American market?<br></strong>No. The melon has a particular consumer culture in each country. The consumption for the Santa Claus melon is highest in Spain and Portugal. French-speaking countries prefer Charentais melons. We sell the same amount of melons in summer and winter. The season in Spain begins between May and June and extends until September. When the season is about to finish in Spain, we start in Brazil, which is active from October to March. Then, we go to Senegal until June. This allows us to stay in business throughout the year.</p><p><strong>Bollo won the Taste of the Year award in 2019. Does the company invest in improving its quality?<br></strong>We invest a heavily in improving the quality of our produce. We also invest heavily in advertising. Regarding innovation and the Santa Claus melon—which has about 150 variations—we do follow-up tests and develop different varieties in a single year in all our fields. We are at the forefront of all sorts of innovations. </p><p><strong>Does Bollo use its infrastructure to make production more sustainable, and how has Bollo advanced on the issue of sustainability?</strong><br>Valencia has a strong agricultural tradition. Most of the existing varieties of tomato, pepper, zucchini, and eggplants come from Valencia. In terms of sustainability, we have a water-saving program to reduce water wastage. No country can match the level of food security and freshness of the produce in Spain. The next generation of consumers will be even more demanding and will have access to a wide range of fruits. Spain's best bet for the future is not on the quantity but rather the quality of its produce. </p><p><strong>Which countries represent your biggest markets?<br></strong>Over the last four years, we have entered 15 countries with great success. These countries are also producers, but Spanish production gives them more security. China is a good example, where we have been present for more than three years. We also send fruit to Canada, the UAE, and Singapore. Although European consumption for some fruit categories, such as citrus, has decreased, we continue to grow by 6%.</p><p><strong>What are Bollo's goals for 2020?<br></strong>We intend to continue with our policy of being fair to the various stakeholders involved in our sector. Our goal is to be consistent with the quality of our fruit and maintain our high standards. We are going to continue developing more varieties of melons and citrus fruits. We want to be the best seller of avocados globally. Our avocado plantations are new and began growing last year, using the best technology that exists. The important thing is to have the professionalism and follow the stages of nature regarding flowering and its cycles. By following these guidelines, we will be able to produce the best quality avocados and differentiate ourselves. We are innovating our packaging to attract the young generation. It is important to adapt according to the demands of the market. We are determined to use the best technologies and respect the environment. </p>]]></richbody0content>
