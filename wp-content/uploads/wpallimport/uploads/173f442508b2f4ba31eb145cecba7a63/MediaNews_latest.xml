		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>Quito, March 8, 2022 Quito, Ecuador&mdash;With the aim of strengthening the skills and knowledge of 70 women leaders and enhancing their role in the public and private sectors, on March 5 in the city of Quito, Seminarium Ecuador organized the workshop "Tools and political strategy for Women Leaders&rdquo; given by the political consultant Juan Mateo Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga.</p>
<p>The meeting was attended by prominent businesswomen, corporate leaders, women in politics, and activists, among others, convinced that training is essential for women to be prepared and take on the challenges in spaces of power, decision-making, and execution of public policy.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">During the workshop, Juan Mateo Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga highlighted the importance of collecting information, to understand the electorate or the public of interest. He highlighted that knowing how the new artificial intelligence tools contribute to the construction of collective identities, generate new conversations and explore new languages to create and amplify more powerful messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Mar&iacute;a Rosa Tapia, President of Seminarium Ecuador, emphasized that "from Seminarium Women Leaders we want to contribute to strengthening the capacities of women who want to participate in electoral processes, so that new female political figures emerge to occupy leadership positions and become protagonists of the change."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">The Manager of Public Affairs, Communication and Sustainability of Arca Continental, Alexandra Chamba, questioned: &ldquo;What have we done for inclusion and equity?&rdquo; Indicating that in the company they constantly work on the inclusion of women in the different productive activities and promote equal opportunities for women within the organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Mar&iacute;a Christina Gonz&aacute;lez, Senior Vice President of Citi, highlighted the contribution that these spaces generate for women to enhance their skills through diversity of thought, gender equality and diverse talent.&nbsp; For his part, Miguel &Aacute;ngel Puente mentioned the importance of including women in the various spaces of power and decision-making within organizations. He pointed out that:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">"We value and enhance the capabilities of women, which is why we have a career plan that promotes equal opportunities for their greater participation in organizational leadership and decision-making spaces."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Finally, Adriana La Valley, IDB Operations Chief in Ecuador, highlighted important figures that show the existing gaps, she spoke of the vision for 2025 to achieve sustainable economic recovery. "We believe that the inclusion of women to have a more diversified workforce strengthens productivity." She mentioned that there is still a gender gap in access to ICTs and this limits their access to education, health, etc. She said that in Ecuador by 2020, 35% of women did not know how to use a smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.125rem;">Although Ecuador was one of the pioneers in the region in establishing equity policies in the participation of women, these actions have not been enough, because women continue to fight to participate in equal conditions and with the same opportunities as men. men, in spaces of power, decision-making and execution of public policy.</span></p>]]></body0content>

		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>The Business Year (TBY), a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world&rsquo;s most dynamic markets for over a decade, is pleased to announce the release of its eleventh edition in Mexico. The edition features over 200 interviews with policymakers and leading business executives in Latin America&rsquo;s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>This latest year-long period of research was marked by a sense of reflection and reinvention in the business community. As the world continues to restructure itself in the wake of COVID-19 and the subsequent disruption to the global supply chain, players in the country are continuing to discover Mexico&rsquo;s role in this new reality. Many executives shared that they used the crisis as an opportunity to question entire business models and venture into segments that had previously been on the back burner.</p>
<p>Keeping up with the theme of change, TBY saw a rising interest in the country to align with environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) criteria and included for the first time a chapter dedicated to the topic. Gender equality is also starting to gain more visibility in the market. With this in mind, the 2022 edition presents the release of the Women in Innovation list, which was developed in collaboration with Great Culture to Innovate in order to highlight the importance of inclusion and diversity in the workplace.</p>
<p>Among the industries that stood out the most for having the fastest comeback was logistics and manufacturing. In this matter, The Business Year has included a special spotlight on the city of Monterrey as industrial activity in the north was marked by an influx of international companies, particularly from Asia.</p>]]></body0content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>The Business Year (TBY) has awarded Nigerian entrepreneur, investor, philanthropist, and Chairman of Coronation Capital, Mr. Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede, with its Entrepreneur of the Year 2017 award in recognition of his entrepreneurial drive and visionary leadership in Nigeria's business scene.</p>
<p>In particular, special consideration was given to the exceptional results achieved in 2017 by Wapic Insurance PLC, in which he is a core investor and Chairman. The award ceremony was held in Coronation Capital's offices in Ikoyi, Lagos.</p>
<p>Despite the challenging climate, in 1Q2017 Wapic Insurance reported a 135% increase in Profit Before Tax (PBT) compared to the same period the year before. The performance is a clear sign of the insurer's consolidating position as the leading firm in Nigeria's insurance industry and of its commitment to international standards, financial strength, and excellent risk rating.</p>
<p>A qualified lawyer, Aig-Imoukhuede earned a reputation as a highly respected financial professional during his three decades as a banker, when, together with his deputy and business partner Herbert Wigwe, he managed to transform the-then failing Access Bank into one of the top-five banks in the country, before stepping down as CEO in 2013 and founding Coronation Capital, a successful Nigerian private equity investment management and advisory firm. Aig-Imoukhuede is also the President of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), the founder of the Africa Initiative for Governance (AIG), a non-profit organization established to be a catalyst for high public sector performance and to inspire and support future leaders of the public sector; and co-chairman of the UK-Nigeria Capital Market Task Force, while also sitting on the board of other management companies in Nigeria and abroad. Besides his activity in the financial sector, Aig-Imoukhuede is also actively engaged in many social and philanthropic initiatives.</p>
<p>Aig-Imoukhuede expressed his appreciation and stated his admiration for international companies such as TBY that decide to enter the Nigerian market and commit to the country for the long term, showcasing the opportunities it offers to the investor community.</p>
<p>TBY, a leading research firm and publisher of annual economic resources on national economies, is currently conducting interviews for its fourth annual edition on the country, The Business Year: Nigeria 2018. Produced in partnership with the President's office and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, this issue will include face-to-face interviews with over 120 of Nigeria's leading figures on the business, politics, and economy scenes.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>TBY presented Roberto Roy, Panama's Minister of Canal Affairs and Metro, with an award recognizing the positive impact that the metro is having on Panamanian society. Edoardo Caccin, TBY's Country Editor in Panama, praised the Ministry's work toward the improvement and modernization of Panama's infrastructure network.</p><p>“Minister Roy is currently focusing on innovation and infrastructure development has resulted in tremendous gains for the local economy and society. The new, expanding Metro imposed itself as a paradigmatic infrastructure project not only in the country, but also in the region and worldwide."</p><p>When receiving the Award, Minister Roy commented that “this award recognizes our efforts to instill a new concept of mobility in Panama. This is just the beginning. The long-term view for the metro is actually a total of seven or eight lines."</p><p>The Ministry is currently changing the fleet from trains of three to five cars each, thus increasing the capacity of each train considerably. In this way Panama Metro can cope with the estimated growing demand. If we look at national polls, the metro has registered as the biggest contributor to public satisfaction. “We are always above 80%, which gives us a lot of happiness. We are proud to have done something that has really changed people's lives for the better in Panama", concluded Mr. Roy.</p><p>Further information about the undergoing expansion of the Metro in Panama, including an interview with Roberto Roy, can be found in upcoming The Business Year: Panama 2017.</p>]]></body0content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Colombia, April 15, 2015</strong>—Last year, Bancolombia went from 25,000 to 75,000 shareholders in a historic process of democratization and capitalization in a bid to extend its model of human banking across the continent.</p><p>It's not difficult to see the various criteria on which Bancolombia has continuously excelled in measures of its liquidity, unwavering share price, dedication to excellence, and ultimately the affirmation that its human banking model has led to solid commercial results on its balance sheets, and sentiments of commitment across all socio-economic groups of society.</p><p>The Bank's achievements were acknowledged on April 15 by The Business Year, which recognized Bancolombia as the Most Socially Responsible Bank of the Year, paying tribute to the group's excellence, with particular reference to its human banking model and practices. The award has been one amongst a series of recognitions given by the publisher to exemplary investors and stakeholders in the Colombian economy, in addition to the titles Foreign Investor of the Year and Mobile Operator of the Year earlier on in 2015.</p><p>The award was presented by TBY's Country Manager in Colombia, Selene Miramontes, and Country Editor, Richard Kent, during an award ceremony at the Club el Nogal in Bogotá on Tuesday April 15. Miramontes acclaimed the bank's foundation, Fundación Bancolombia, which has been at the core of its human banking practice. The foundation has developed over 150 institutions nationwide and helped educate hundreds of thousands of children, awarded thousands of scholarships and financial assistance to the millions of Colombians effected by displacement and violence, and trained over 2,000 teachers.</p><p>Miramontes commended how the human banking philosophy is “reflected not only by the scale of assistance that you have offered through the foundation, but practice in sustainability and employment of green technologies, your public stance against everything from extortion, corruption, and to issues of eradicating child labor, and is a model to follow at both a regional and international level."</p><p>In 2014, Bancolombia had what was by many measures the most successful year in its 140-year history. It reached consolidated revenues of Ps1.9 billion, up 24% YoY, and a combined share value of Ps150 billion, a rise of 14% YoY.</p><p>The group ended the year with capitalization of Ps2.7 billion; the reasons for this due to its bonds emission of approximately Ps1 billion in March of 2014, which led to the number of shareholders skyrocketing from 25,000 to 70,000.</p><p>In 2015 the group will be investing over $300 million in its regional operations. These investments include $150 million in Colombia, and investments of $100 million in Panama and $60 million destined for El Salvador, in order to consolidate the respective purchases of HSBC and Banco AgroMercantil.</p><p>In receiving the recognition, President Carlos Raúl Yepes Jiménez said, “We are very happy to receive this recognition, which represents one of the main causes we represent today, social responsibility, along with sustainability, and our human banking model."</p><p>Yepes referred to the pillars of efficiency, innovation, technologyl and above all human banking. Concerning its application at a macro level, Yepes affirmed, “It is due to the development of these pillars that we are expecting 12% growth in our portfolio, in a range from 10-15%. This is an important figure as it denotes we are growing 2-3 times faster than the national GDP in all the countries where we are present—despite the external pressure due to the current global and local macroeconomic conditions, we expect a positive performance."</p><p>Bancolombia has recently celebrated its 140th anniversary since it was founded in Bogotá in 1875 by a group of 25 distinguished entrepreneurs representing various different industrial interests.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Colombia, February 25, 2015</strong>—The Business Year (TBY) has delivered the recognition of "Best Foreign Investor" to Huawei, the Chinese telecoms and mobile products giant, for its dedication and commitment to Colombia by providing high-quality technology at the most competitive prices.</p><p>The award was presented by Country Manager Selene Colombia Miramontes, and Country Editor Richard Kent.</p><p>During the award ceremony, Miramontes stated, "Huawei's recognition as Best Foreign Investor is due the dedication to value and accessibility of high-quality technology, where it is needed the most. Huawei plays an important role in the Colombian knowledge economy, leading the way in technology and connectivity for the Colombian population."</p><p>Mr. Cui Wei, Manager of Huawei in Colombia, received the award and told the media that, "The ICT industry in Colombia is very large and is growing exponentially. We firmly believe in the potential of Colombia in the next 2-3 years, and we will grow together with the industry. "The investments of the company have been primarily focused on the development of 4G technology, in order to reduce regional gaps in the country."</p><p>He went on to add  that, "Huawei has made the installations of the first LTE networks in Colombia for Une, and today we have transformed into one of the most strategic partners for the leading operators in the country. This means  we can move forward with our investment plan, reducing the digital divide, and continue bringing our products to all Colombians."</p><p>The company continues to develop products, services, and applications for use by operators, businesses, and government, as well focusing on its traditional client base of mass consumers by constantly delivering new devices and state-of-the-art technology.</p><p>The potential of the mass consumer market was the impetus behind the group's relocation to the Colombian market in the first place. Colombia has an extraordinarily high penetration of mobile phones per inhabitant (105%), where 65% of the population uses smartphones.</p><p>The company had a significant growth in sales of terminals in 2014, supported by strategic alliances with Claro, Movistar, Tigo, Une, and ETB, to continue their brand positioning. The group has sold more tablets in Colombia than in any other American country and, in 2012-2014, achieved growth in brand recognition. Today, Huawei commands a 70% share of the market for LTE (4G) in Colombia.</p><p>Colombia accounts for 20% of sales of 5 million units achieved during the first three quarters of 2014 between Mexico, the Caribbean, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Spain, and is the second largest for Huawei in the Latin American market. The group is investing heavily in innovation and research at an international level, preparing to enter markets with significant growth, such as Colombia.</p><p>"At our headquarters in China are investing a minimum of $600 million in innovation and research 5G networks until 2018. We expect the first 5G networks reach Colombia in 2020," Wei said. The first 5G networks will be ready in early 2020 with a speed of 10Gbps, 100 times faster than current 4G networks.</p>]]></body1content>

TBY presents a range of awards celebrating successes in all fields of business every year.</p><p>The excellence of the group has been commended not only by the international investment community represented by our readers, but by the Colombian state and its people by their awarding of further concessions, such as the Magdalena River Project, which demonstrates the group's willingness to build upon its legacy of infrastructure projects in Colombia. Carla Albertí de la Rosa, TBY's Regional Director, introduced the award by saying, “on behalf of TBY, we would like to formally recognize Odebrecht as the Engineering and Construction Company of the Year. These projects will have a huge impact on Colombia's economy and will change the country's direction from today and always."</p><p>Odebrecht has led the development of some of Colombia's most important infrastructure works, including La Ruta del Sol, and unified consortiums with other notable Colombian construction groups. TBY commended the group's readiness to assume leadership of one of the most iconic infrastructure project in Colombia's history, the Magdalena River Project, and wished Odebrecht all the best in realizing a series of landmark projects that will change the face of Colombia's transport infrastructure forever.</p><p>Mr. Eleuberto Martorelli, Director of Odebrecht in Colombia, was delighted to receive the award on behalf of the company in Bogotá. Speaking about the Magdalena River Project, Martorelli commented that, “The recovery of the navigability of the Magdalena River is fundamental for increasing competitiveness in the country, because it means a lower cost in transport load that consequently will have economic and social benefits for Colombians," adding that, “this project strengthens Odebrecht's presence of more than 22 years in the country and is the ideal scenario to apply, along our partner Valorcon, our knowledge, management capacity, and expertise in quality execution, respecting the environment, and generating wealth for the communities and the country's economic growth."</p><p><strong>Odebrecht</strong></p><p>Odebrecht is a global organization of Brazilian origin, with a ongoing commitment to satisfying its clients, generating value for its shareholders, developing the communities in which it does business, and helping its members fulfill their potential.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Palma de Mallorca, July 28, 2021&mdash;Representatives from The Business Year (TBY) and the Industrial Association of Mallorca (ASIMA) have signed an MoU to establish a partnership to collaborate on the production of the upcoming Special Report: Mallorca. This agreement will allow TBY to shed more light on the industrial landscape of the island of Mallorca and the investment opportunities available.</p>
<p>Francisco Martorell Esteban, President of ASIMA, told TBY in an interview that; &ldquo;There are more than 2,000 companies located in the Son Castell&oacute; and Can Valero industrial areas, distributed across a multitude of sectors. The top-five most-representative are: trade and vehicle repairs, manufacturing, construction, real estate, and hotel and catering. The level of specification is a reflection of the Balearic economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additionally, Mallorca seeks to further embrace sustainability and circularity, given the high pressure of more than 13 million visitors per year in pre-COVID-19 times. According to Francisco Martorell Esteban, the existing industrial sector is committed to support this transformation. &ldquo;We want to turn the Son Castell&oacute; industrial area into the first one in Spain to calculate air quality, carbon footprint, and other environmental variables that help us to make working environments increasingly sustainable and efficient. All companies are already obliged to calculate their carbon footprints. We will have an online platform where we will display all the data. The novelty of this project is that it is a large area, and blockchain technology is being used. We hope that, in 2022, it will be a reality. As far as companies are concerned, there is a strong environmental responsibility. Mallorca is full of natural resources, and businesses all want to take care of them and conserve them so that we continue to be the jewel of the Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The MoU was signed after taking into consideration TBY's experience as a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world's most dynamic markets and sectors for over a decade, and ASIMA's position as a representative entity of the industrial sector of Mallorca. The report will feature the direct words of a wide range of local business leaders through interviews, as well as additional statistical information and articles addressing the main projects and initiatives to bear in mind when considering investing in Mallorca.</p>
<p>Special Report: Mallorca will be distributed both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms. All interviews and content will be also available on the key business information platforms, including Bloomberg Terminal, Refinitiv Eikon, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet.</p>

<p>Luanda, June 29, 2021—Representatives from The Business Year (TBY), a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world's most dynamic markets for over a decade, and The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Angola (CCIA) have signed an MoU to establish a strategic partnership and further research for The Business Year: Angola 2022, TBY's inaugural publication on the southern African nation.</p>
<p>The publication will include over 150 interviews with public figures and business leaders from every major sector of the national economy, highlighting investment opportunities, economic trends, and the latest government reforms. The Business Year: Angola 2022 will showcase the government's efforts to diversify the Angolan economy and consolidate it as one of the leading economies in Africa.</p>
<p>The MoU was signed in Luanda between Vicente Francisco Soares, President of the CCIA, and Johana Rincón, TBY Country Manager for Angola. The Business Year: Angola 2022 is part of TBY's plans to further expand its coverage in Africa, where it is already present in Morocco, Nigeria, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, and Ghana.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Vicente Francisco Soares commented that, “CCIA is focusing on training programs for labour and entrepreneurs, promoting our companies, and attracting foreign investment into Angola, finding partners for local companies that do not have the financial capacity to start their businesses."</p>
<p>Johana Rincón, while reflecting on the upcoming project, underlined “the importance of the government's efforts to improve the national education system and infrastructure, which will be the foundation for the future development of Angolan society."</p>
<p>TBY's first-hand research reaches key international investors and members of the global business community, targeting international financial institutions, international corporations, investors, accountancy firms, industrial conglomerates, and governmental organizations. The Business Year: Angola 2022 will be distributed extensively, both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms. All interviews and content will be also available on key business information platforms, including Bloomberg Terminal, Refinitiv, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet. It will also be available on the PressReader and Google Books platforms.</p>]]></body1content>

<p>The Business Year and the Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca, a civil society organization based in Palma de Mallorca bringing together 275 members and 32 collaborating entities, met to finalize terms of collaboration for the production of <em>Special Report: Mallorca</em>.</p>
<p>This publication will serve to promote Mallorca as an investment destination and outline new sectors that will enable the island to make a transition to a more sustainable development model and diversify away from its tourism and real estate-dependent economy. Coverage of Mallorca is part of The Business Year's plans to expand its coverage of the Spanish economy and produce a higher volume of market intelligence on regions of Spain with a greater foreign component in their economies, such as the Balearic Islands.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed in the form of an MoU between the parties, and inked by Josep Maria Vicens, President of the Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca, and Ioana Popa, Regional Director of The Business Year.</p>
<p>During the meeting, an interview was conducted with representatives from Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca. &ldquo;Over the last 50 years, Baleares has grown significantly due to construction and tourism. We need to maintain an excellent tourism experience to receive quality visitors who respect the environment. In addition, there is an opportunity to develop new projects that help to diversify the economy of the region," stated Josep Maria Vicens, President of the Cercle. Additionally, he pointed out sectors that offer strategic value, such as biomedicine, health, and social care. All of that is being complemented by digitalization projects such as the Nou Llevant innovation district.</p>
<p>The MoU was signed after taking into consideration TBY's experience as a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world's most dynamic markets and sectors for over a decade, and the Cercle d'Economia de Mallorca's position as a representative entity of civil society on the island. Special Report: Mallorca will profile the main sectors offering traditional opportunities for investments, such as the well-known combination of tourism and real estate and, most importantly, non-traditional opportunities in sectors such as health tourism, sports, local manufacturing, logistics, and audiovisual production, among others. The report will feature the direct words of a wide range of local business leaders through interviews, as well as additional statistical information and articles addressing the main projects and initiatives to bear in mind when considering investing in Mallorca.</p>
<p><em>Special Report: Mallorca</em> will be distributed both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms. All interviews and content will be also available on key business information platforms, including Bloomberg Terminal, Thomson Reuters Eikon, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet, as well as the PressReader and Google Books platforms.</p>]]></body1content>

<p>Palma de Mallorca, June 6, 2021&mdash;Representatives from The Business Year (TBY) and the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca have signed an MoU to establish a partnership as part of The Business Year's plans to expand its coverage of the Spanish economy and produce a higher volume of market intelligence on differing regions. The content will be featured in TBY's upcoming publication, Special Report: Mallorca. The MoU was signed in Palma de Mallorca between Antoni Mercant Morat&oacute;, President of Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca, and Ioana Popa, Regional Director for The Business Year.</p>
<p>This special coverage of Mallorca's economy comes at a moment of both impasse and rethinking on the island's economic future. While COVID-19 has been a blow to its tourism- and real estate-dependent economy, Mallorca's public and private sectors are starting to work hand-in-hand to draw new lines of economic activity and set out the investments needed to transform the island. Mallorca seeks to promote investments in new sectors that will allow for a planned transition to a more sustainable, greener, and digital environment, which will be favored by Next Generation EU funds.<br /><br />The MoU was signed after taking into consideration TBY's experience as a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world's most dynamic markets and sectors for over a decade, and the Chamber of Commerce of Mallorca's position as a representative entity of the island of Mallorca and its business community. Special Report: Mallorca will profile the main sectors offering traditional opportunities for investments, such as the well-known combination of tourism and real estate, and, more importantly, non-traditional opportunities in sectors such as health tourism, sports, local manufacturing, logistics, and audiovisual production, among others. The report will feature the direct words of a wide range of local business leaders through interviews, as well as additional statistical information and articles addressing the main projects and initiatives to bear in mind when considering investing in Mallorca.<br /><br />Special Report: Mallorca will be distributed both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms. All interviews and content will be available on key business information platforms, including Bloomberg Terminal, Refinitiv Eikon, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet, and available on PressReader and Google Books.</p>]]></body1content>

<p>The Business Year recently awarded its "Economic Diversification Project of the Year" accolade to the Hamad Port Project, with the news making headlines across local media. The Business Year presented the award to HE Jassim Saif Ahmed Al-Sulaiti, Qatar Minister of Transport and Communications, Capt. Abdullah Al-Khanji, CEO of Mwani Qatar, and Eng. Nabil AlKhaldi, Executive Director of Hamad Port Project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamad Port's strong capabilities, modern facilities, and advanced systems are leading its position as the gateway to Qatar and a transshipment and a re-export hub in the region, increasing the volume of trade between Qatar and the rest of the world. Last year, Hamad Port achieved a record container volume for the fourth straight year in a row with transshipment volumes rising by 106%. The increase in transshipments is an important sign of the port's role in the region. Multiple container terminals at Hamad Port have been planned to facilitate the expansion of container handling capacity, commensurate with the growing traffic of cargo demand," stated the Minister.</p>
<p>During the event held at the Ministry, Nataly Almanza, Country Director of The Business Year, referred to the reasons behind this recognition: &ldquo;We at The Business Year have been first-hand witnesses to the development of this project since our arrival in the country. 2021 will be the year in which Hamad Port becomes operational at full capacity; the delay caused by 2020 has been minimum. Container Terminal 2's inauguration is the big milestone of the year that we are all expecting to occur. Phase II of Hamad Port will be a great improvement and the final stage of a 10-year trip, but, at the same time, will only be the beginning."</p>
<p>According to WTO, economic diversification happens when factors of production are moved within and across different sectors towards higher productivity uses, which is directly linked to structural transformation and trade diversification. In the case of Hamad Port, this comes in the form of the efficient management of goods and services transportation, the focus on export growth, FDI attraction and on increasing the range of goods and services exported. The Umm Al-Houl Special Economic Zone, situated close to Hamad Port, is one of several Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in Qatar that encourage entrepreneurship and help foster growth among small and medium-sized enterprises. Hamad Port Project has simply helped Qatar to successfully overcome the dominance of natural resources and the shackles of geography. The impact of Hamad Port Project also comes in the form of affecting the day-to-day business operations and investment decisions in Qatar by providing appropriate incentive frameworks, investment and policy reforms aimed at slashing trade costs, and effective policies to support the reallocation of some of Qatar's resources towards new activities. This was the key to achieving Qatar's economic independence and diversification. The Hamad Port Project is being undertaken to attract trade and industrialization to diversify the economy in line with Qatar National Vision 2030. The services and facilities at Hamad Port have encouraged shipping lines to call their mainline services to Hamad Port directly.</p>
<p>The Hamad Port is currently handling more than 24 direct services of all the major global shipping lines every week. These direct mainline services have opened various new trade routes and opportunities to bolster the growth of trade and industry in Qatar. Hamad Port is instrumental in the efficient shipping of products that companies handle for clients.</p>
<p>The commencing of CT2 is another milestone added to Hamad Port's record of achievements. The additional 624 meters of quayside with 380,000 sqm of storage facilities, remote-controlled quay cranes, and environmentally friendly RTGs and tractors have boosted CT2's huge potential, modern facilities, and advanced systems for increasing Qatar's trade with the world. The development of CT2 is to ensure the sustainable growth of local trade and to improve the port's competitiveness by transforming it into a regional transshipment hub.</p>
<p>With a team of researchers on the ground, The Business Year has witnessed closely the transformation of Qatar into a more diverse and resilient economy since the advent of Qatar National Vision 2030 and fully recognizes the importance of Hamad Port for the realization of the country's lofty 2030 goals. With the impact of COVID-19 disrupting international supply chains and the logistics sector, recovery will be predicated on the success of institutions such as Hamad Port, which can guarantee an efficient, technology-enhanced, and safe exchange of supplies with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>This and other milestones will be included in <em>The Business Year: Qatar 2021</em>, the latest annual publication on the Gulf economy, which is yet to be published. The publication will include a wide range of interviews with high-level corporate and public-sector figures, as well as feature articles and analysis on topics such as private sector participation through the new PPP scheme, digitalization of the economy, and Qatar's strong response to COVID19.</p>]]></body1content>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>MoU signed between Bahrain Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) and TBY to further research for The Business Year: Bahrain 2021</p>]]></description>

<p>The MoU was signed in Manama between Shakir Ebrahim Al Shater, CEO of the BCCI, and Yohana Bolivar Rojas, TBY Country Manager for Bahrain.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Muscat, January 9, 2019&mdash;TBY, a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world's most dynamic markets, sat down for a meeting with HE Tahir Bin Salim bin Abdullah Al Amri, the Executive President of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), to discuss the direction of the Central Bank of Oman and his view on how technology can facilitate the development of a more transparent and efficient financial sector.</p>
<p>Tahir Bin Salim bin Abdullah Al Amri stressed the importance of working hand in hand with the banking sector in advancing the digital transformation agenda. He also reassured investors on the joint initiatives that are being taken with the Capital Market Authority (CMA) to develop the local debt market, deemed crucial for players not to resort necessarily to offshore funding. The conversation later verted toward finding innovative solutions to guarantee a certain degree of independence in monetary policy despite the Omani Riyal being pegged to the US Dollar.</p>
<p>TBY's team, led by Elena Barreiro, TBY Country Director for Oman, and Gabriele de Leva, TBY Country Editor for Oman, illustrated to Al Amri the goals and KPIs of The Business Year: Oman 2020. The project, supported by Oman's Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development, will have a special focus on innovation and will entail a special set of programs for the 50th anniversary of the Blessed Renaissance March.</p>
<p>TBY's first-hand research reaches key international investors and members of the global business community, targeting international financial institutions, international corporations, investors, accountancy firms, industrial conglomerates, and governmental organizations. The Business Year: Bahrain 2021 will be distributed extensively, both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Quito, October 24, 2019&mdash;Representatives from TBY and the Mining Chamber of Ecuador signed an MoU to establish a strategic partnership as part of the former's plans to expand its coverage of the Ecuadorian economy and produce a higher volume of market intelligence on key sectors of the Ecuadorian economy, such as mining. The content will be featured in TBY's upcoming publication, <em>The Business Year: Ecuador 2020</em>, and in its Special Report: Mining in Ecuador.</p>
<p>2019 is crucial for Ecuador's mining industry as the country's first mega mining projects, Mirador and Fruta del Norte, will enter the production phase. The two projects combined have the potential to contribute up to 2% to GDP. In an interview with TBY, Carlos P&eacute;rez, the Minister of Energy and Non-Renewable Resources, noted that until 2021, USD3.8 billion in investments is set to flow into the mining sector. Located in the Andes region, Ecuador's mining potential remains largely unexplored and untapped, and this has attracted a number of big international players to enter the country. Yet, the regulatory framework still implies challenges, in particular the requirement to have prior consultations with local communities before developing the mine.</p>
<p>The MoU was signed after taking into consideration TBY's experience as a global media group that has been providing investors, businesses, and governments with first-hand insights into the world's most dynamic markets and sectors for over a decade, and the Mining Chamber of Ecuador's position as the representative entity of all mining companies in the country. The partnership was formed in the light of the mutually shared objective of highlighting business opportunities in Ecuador and contributing to the consolidation of a promising mining sector. The Business Year's Special Report: Mining in Ecuador will be an interview-based publication that will address investment opportunities, responsible practices, and economic impact. The report will increase local awareness regarding the benefits of responsible mining and represent the sector internationally, at events such as PDAC 2020, Expo Minas, and Cesco Week, among others.</p>
<p>The Business Year's <em>Special Report: Mining in Ecuador</em> will be released worldwide in February 2020. TBY's first-hand research reaches key international investors and members of the global business community, targeting international financial institutions, international corporations, investors, accountancy firms, industrial conglomerates, and governmental organizations. Special Report: Mining in Ecuador will be distributed extensively, both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms. All interviews and content will be also available on the key business information platforms: Bloomberg Terminal, Thomson Reuters Eikon, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p></p><p>Abu Dhabi, September 30, 2019—TBY will remain a strategic research partner of the UAE's Ministry of Economy (MoE) as it continues to document the Emirates' journey of economic development. To date, TBY is the only global media operating in the UAE with such an endorsement.</p><p>TBY has launched several research publications that chart the business landscape across the country. TBY's in-depth publications draw on the insights of the country's leading business and political figures with the most pressing economic trends serving as a wider focal point.</p><p>As the UAE economy continues to advance across a number of key areas, the MoE has been charged with implementing robust initiatives to steward this economic development. In line with growing an internationally competitive and diversified economy, the UAE has recently announced plans to overhaul its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) laws. Consequently, a total of 122 economic activities across 13 sectors will be eligible for foreign ownership. This aims to consolidate the UAE's reputation as a regional and global business hub. Furthermore, the MoE recently announced plans to eliminate or reduce fees for 115 services with the goal of boosting domestic growth. H.E. Eng. Mohammed Ahmed Bin Abdul Aziz Al Shehhi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Economy for Economic Affairs, affirmed that “The Ministry of Economy has always remained focused on deepening cooperation with partners in both public and private sectors within the country and on the global level on a continuous basis, as it is vital to strengthening the foundations for progress. As we continue to move ahead on the path of economic diversification and development by adopting innovative policies and strategies that consolidate the UAE's reputation as a regional and global business hub, economic research and documentation play a significant role in ensuring the success of these efforts. We are glad to renew this partnership with TBY and look forward to the positive outcomes of our collaboration to further enhance the attractiveness of the UAE's business and investment landscape."</p><p>In a world of increasing trade protectionism, <em>The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 202</em>0 will explore the impact of these themes along with the UAE's reputation as an attractive investment destination.</p><p>As we approach the next decade, several global trends remain constant; the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), for example, will encompass around 30% of global GDP when fully realized. As the crossroads for global trade and commerce, the UAE is set to play a pivotal role in this initiative. In addition to this, the UAE will continue on a growth trajectory as a pioneer of innovative technological and creative development. The views of business leaders included in TBY's research serve as an intriguing observation on what future opportunities and challenges lay in store in regards to these trends.</p><p>TBY's Managing Director for the UAE, Neslihan Aydagül, expressed that, “As a platform for decision-makers and a comprehensive cross-sector investment guide, TBY is proud to build upon its successful partnership with the UAE's Ministry of Economy. Our country-specific publications, each featuring over 150 face-to-face interviews, are among the most comprehensive annual economic publications available internationally. TBY supports the aims of the government by offering an objective window into the business landscape."</p><p><em>The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 2020 </em>will be released worldwide in 1Q2020. TBY's first-hand research reaches key international investors and members of the global business community, targeting international financial institutions, international corporations, investors, accountancy firms, industrial conglomerates, and governmental organizations. The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 2020 will be distributed extensively, both domestically and globally, and will reach an even larger audience via TBY's powerful network of digital platforms. All interviews and content will be also available on the key business information platforms: Bloomberg Terminal, Thomson Reuters Eikon, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Monterrey, March 20, 2019&mdash;The Business Year recently signed an MoU with the Mexican Business Council for Foreign Trade &ndash; Northeast (COMCE Noreste) as part of the company's plans to expand its coverage of the Mexican economy and produce a higher volume of market intelligence on the northern states of Mexico, including Nuevo Le&oacute;n. The content will be featured in TBY's upcoming publication, The Business Year: Mexico 2019.</p>
<p>TBY's association with COMCE Noreste comes at a strategic time, as the business association plans to include the state of Chihuahua among its member states, the main export hubs of which are its capital city Chihuahua and Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez.<br />In addition to this, COMCE Noreste has a long-standing record of promoting business in the states of Nuevo Le&oacute;n, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Durango.</p>
<p>Special attention will be given to Nuevo Le&oacute;n, which will also act as the second TBY's base of operations for its 2019 edition on Mexico.</p>
<p>In 2018, Nuevo Le&oacute;n's GDP growth rate outpaced that of the overall Mexican economy and was one of the top FDI destinations within the country with USD4.26 billion, a 127.2% increase over the previous year. Nuevo Le&oacute;n accounted for 13% of all incoming FDI into Mexico, followed by another northern state, Coahuila, with 9%.</p>
<p>Adding to this, Hector Villarreal Muraira, General Director of COMCE Noreste, mentioned: &ldquo;Nuevo Le&oacute;n exports USD40 billion, with 65% of that coming from companies that are part of COMCE Noreste. Our business association gathers 126 corporate members with 80% of them having regular export-import activity." He also discussed the business climate of Mexico's northern region, marked by its close proximity to the vast consumer market of US.</p>
<p>However, among COMCE Noreste's priorities is to reduce dependency on the US and support local companies in reaching new markets, especially in the rest of Latin America, in line with regional economic integration processes such as the Pacific Alliance.</p>
<p>With over 150 face-to-face interviews with public officials and top corporate executives from all over Mexico, The Business Year: Mexico 2019 will bring first-hand insights from the main players in the Mexican economy to send a direct message to a global audience through various interactive media platforms.</p>
<p>To be published in July 2019, all interviews and content will be also available on four partner business platforms: Bloomberg Terminal, Thomson Reuters Eikon, Dow Jones Factiva, and FactSet.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Amman&mdash;TBY, a leading global media group specializing in economic research and business intelligence, recently spoke with HM Queen Noor, Chairperson of the King Hussein Foundation (KHF), to discuss the foundation's contributions to the Kingdom's socio-economic development. The interview will be featured in TBY's inaugural edition on the country, <em>The Business Year: Jordan 2019</em>.</p>
<p>HM Queen Noor established KHF to carry on the late King Hussein's humanitarian vision and legacy. Today, KHF includes eight institutions under its legal framework and strategic direction: the Jordan Micro Credit Company (Tamweelcom), Ethmar for Islamic Microfinance, the Institute for Family Health, the Community Development Program, the Jubilee Institute, the Information and Research Center, the National Center for Culture and Performing Arts, and the National Music Conservatory.</p>
<p>HM Queen Noor has a long-established career dedicated to advancing Jordan's socio-economic standing, in addition to being an international public servant and advocate for cross-cultural understanding and conflict prevention and recovery issues.</p>
<p>KHF's programs focus on fostering equitable access to socio-economic, education, health, and cultural opportunities for women, young people, and marginalized. Moreover, all programs are defined by an open-source approach that recognizes the importance of knowledge sharing for building capacity in Jordan and across the region.</p>
<p>Another key characteristic of KHF is its ever-evolving focus areas. HM Queen Noor explained that the foundation continuously adapts to the needs of local communities. For example, the inflow of Syrian refugees into the country has raised demand for psycho-social services and trauma care, which has broadened the focus of the Institute for Family Health that fosters the well-being of both Jordanians and refugees. The Institute has further evolved and developed professional training programs for equipping judges and prosecutors who are involved in trauma and torture cases with knowledge for best handling such cases. Establishing Ethmar for Islamic Microfinance to address the supply-demand gap for sharia-compliant microloans is another example of the foundation's agility in addressing people's most relevant needs.</p>
<p>The foundation's continued emphasis on developing people&mdash;both within KHF's institutions and through its programs&mdash;has been paramount to the organization's success. HM Queen Noor elaborated on this point, noting, &ldquo;We did not start off with the financial endowment that most foundations start off with, or that most people assume foundations have. Our capital was our expertise and our best practice programs, which drew in partners, both national and international.&rdquo; The foundation's microfinance programs, Tamweelcom and Ethmar, are stellar examples of using limited resources to the greatest extent possible to promote entrepreneurship and create job opportunities nationwide.</p>
<p>Beyond financial solutions, the foundation's integrated, holistic programs are creating global citizens best trained for the future. HM Queen Noor shared, &ldquo;At a purely academic level, the Jubilee Institute is focused not only on providing Jordanian scholarship students with an enhanced and enriched education experience, but also an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) topics, without dismissing the importance of the arts, and all the while nurturing global citizens who are compassionate, socially responsible, and inquisitive critical thinkers. She highlighted the foundation's efforts to ensure a gender perspective wherever needed, &ldquo;unleashing the potential of men and women alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Jordan 2019</em> is TBY's first annual edition on the Hashemite Kingdom, providing unmatched coverage of the economy and investment opportunities through exclusive interviews with leaders across Jordan's private and public sectors.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Riyadh, November 26, 2018&mdash;TBY is thrilled to announce the launch of <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018/19</em>. For its fifth annual edition on the Kingdom's economy, TBY conducted around 250 interviews with the main policymakers and leading corporate executives to discover key economic trends, the pace and impact of reforms under Vision 2030, and the investment opportunities for the global business community.</p>
<p>Under the de facto leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia has been undergoing a series of socioeconomic transformation aimed at modernizing the Kingdom's business environment and strengthening its assumed regional role. Through increased government spending, set to further increase according to the 2019 budget announcement, both the public and private sectors are asked to meet the KPIs set by the National Transformation Plan 2.0, a preliminary test in light of the final 2030 exam. New destination developments, digital transformation, push towards downstream, and localization are all key themes covered in <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018/19</em> and these will gain even further relevance in the course of the ongoing <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2019/2</em><em>0</em>.</p>
<p>Privatization efforts are rapidly taking place in sectors such as utilities, transportation, and education, while a new spotlight feature takes into account the vital role SMEs are playing in this transformation. A conversation between seven of the key people behind this change sheds lights on the ins and outs. &ldquo;Encouraging entrepreneurship is an important avenue to diversify the Kingdom's economy, and the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Investment has equipped itself with various new subsidiaries, programs, and taskforces to drive this ecosystem,&rdquo; says Majid bin Abdullah Al Qasabi, Minister of Commerce &amp; Investment. &ldquo;Long-term planning is essential, but the policy landscape requires that planning be coupled with support that is dynamic, analytical and grounded in methods that yield an evidence-based approach to policy making,&rdquo; highlights Mohammed Al-Tuwaijri, Minister of Economy &amp; Planning. Also featured in this spotlight are Prince Faisal Bin Bandar Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, Governor of Riyadh Region &amp; Chairman of the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh; Khalid Abdullah Al Hussan, CEO, Saudi Stock Exchange; Ahmad Yahya Aljubaili, Executive Director, National Commission for Academic Accrediation and Assessment; Husameedin Al Madani, Director General, National Center for Performance Measurement; and Dr. Nabeel bin Mohammed Al-Amudi, Minister of Transport.</p>
<p>The Kingdom's Vision 2030 was a key focus of TBY Analytics Saudi Arabia 2018/19, TBY's unique methodology used to translate C-level opinion into real-time statistics, completed in partnership with the General Authority for Statistics. 42% of interviewees in Saudi Arabia are positive regarding the impact Vision 2030 will have on business. Many believe it will lead to changing attitudes both at home and abroad, more open mindedness, new demands in the market, and more technological innovation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saudi's Vision 2030 is coming to fruition and has succeeded in placing the Kingdom among the top-10 countries worldwide in terms of the business environment, as indicated by a recent World Bank report on the protection of minority investors,&rdquo; reflects Ibrahim Al Omar, the Governor for Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA).</p>
<p>Vision 2030 is also playing a major role in advancing Saudi's industry and defense sectors. The vision emphasizes that its key objective is to localize manufacturing and move the sector up the value chain. This has been translated into the mandates of organizations such as the Saudi Industrial Property Authority (MODON) and the Saudi Industrial Development Fund. &ldquo;MODON is going through a transformation of the approach of supporting the industry here,&rdquo; said its Director General, Khalid Mohammed Al Salem. &ldquo;We are now moving to more innovative and advanced services in our existing industrial cities, toward smart cities.&rdquo; Elsewhere, in the defense sector, localization objectives have been formulated to increase from 10 to 50% by 2030, which means significant investment and a ramping up of knowledge transfers as firms look to localize their operations.</p>
<p>Other prominent interviewees featured throughout the publication include: Mohammed A. Al-Mowkley, Deputy Minister of Water Services &amp; CEO, National Water Company; Fouad Halawi, CEO, Virgin Mobile Saudi Arabia; Nabeel bin Mohammed Al-Amudi, Minister of Transport; Walker Kimball, Project Director, BACS Riyadh; and Abdulaziz Turki Alfaisal Al Saud, Vice Chairman, General Sports Authority.</p>
<p>Ay≈üe Valentin, TBY's CEO, spoke on the occasion of the launch. &ldquo;Overall, The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018/19 is a landmark publication. It combines our experience from nearly a decade of coverage with one of the world's most ambitious reform efforts.&rdquo;</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Abu Dhabi, January 10, 2019&mdash;TBY, a leading international research firm and publisher of annual economic resources on national economies, is pleased to announce the launch of The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 2019, in partnership with the UAE Ministry of Economy. For its fifth annual edition on Abu Dhabi, TBY conducted more than 150 interviewees with industry executives to shed light on the major investment opportunities for the global business community.</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 2019</em> introduces a new feature explaining the role of Abu Dhabi's Executive Council. The Executive Council members profiles are introduced in a helpful format that serves as an illustrative guide to Abu Dhabi's government. This is followed by a tribute to His Highness, the Late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founder of the UAE, whose 100th birthday was celebrated throughout 2018.</p>
<p>The oil and gas sector occupies a predominant segment of <em>The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 2019</em>, as state-owned oil company Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) progressed steadily in its restructuring process through the announcements of its downstream strategy and the In-Country Value (ICV) program, as well as the implementation of a renewed partnership model. Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, CEO of ADNOC Group, emphasized the significance of these plans in discussion with TBY when he highlighted that &ldquo;By 2025, our downstream strategy will add over 15,000 jobs, contribute an additional 1% of GDP per year, and create multiple opportunities for new business. It will also create significant in-country value, as our domestic and international partners work more closely with local SME's to maximize the use of local products, manufacturing and assembly facilities, services and infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, the development of Abu Dhabi's non-oil sector and efforts to move the economy away from its dependence on oil and gas are also examined. TBY discussed this with Sultan Bin Saeed Al Mansoori, UAE Minister of Economy, who underlined that &ldquo;the country, in line with UAE Vision 2021, is keen to build a diverse, globally competitive economy based on innovation and knowledge and led by national competencies, find other sources of income away from oil, and develop the non-oil economic sectors that are viable, such as manufacturing, tourism, and SMEs, in addition to the seven sectors identified by the National Innovation Strategy, namely technology, health, education, transportation, renewable energy, water, and space, as well as non-oil sectors that further the government's plans, such as infrastructure, trade, logistics services, and the financial and retail sector, to increase the contribution of the non-oil sector to GDP to 80% by 2021.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mohammed Ahmed Bin Abdulaziz Al-Shehhi, Undersecretary of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Economy, also provides an inside perspective for the publication, diving into the issue of intellectual property; &ldquo;the UAE is making every effort to enhance its IP framework and thereby becoming a global hub for innovation and creativity,&rdquo; the Undersecretary told TBY.</p>
<p>Several restructuring efforts have also been introduced to improve the ease of doing business and create incentives for investors. Ahmad Bin Ghannam, Acting CEO, Abu Dhabi Investment Office (ADIO), reaffirmed to TBY the importance of creating an attractive business environment to encourage investors with innovative ideas. &ldquo;Our ability to attract further FDI will grow further as the Emirate's business ecosystem continues to move up the global competitiveness scale&rdquo;. In this sense, a major milestone was the announcement of Ghadan 21, a AED50-billion government spending package which aims to revitalize the economy has been dubbed by many among both government and private sector leaders as a 'necessary adjustment'</p>
<p>TBY Analytics, TBY's unique methodology for parsing C-level opinion into real-time statistics, deduced that opportunities abound across a wide range of asset class for different types of risk profiles, led by a wide-ranging technological transformation. In an interview with TBY, Khaldoon Khalifa Al Mubarak, Group Chief Executive Officer &amp; Managing Director of Mubadala Investment Company, spoke on the sovereign fund's diversification and investment strategy. &ldquo;With our increased exposure to the technology sector, we expect to deploy capital in high potential sectors. We will make strategic investments to position ourselves at the leading edge of these sectors&rdquo;. Additionally, within the insurance sector, TBY Analytics point out that while health and automotive segments take the center stage, life insurance is setting up to take the sector by storm.</p>
<p>The major themes influencing the built environment are examined at length in the urban planning, real estate, and construction section of the publication. Abu Dhabi continues to post an oversupply in real estate, which led to competitive prices, while government initiatives such as 10-year visas for foreigners and increased tourism activity are expected to increase demand. Falah Al Ahbabi, the Chairman of the Department of Urban Planning and Municipalities (DPM), was keen to affirm that Abu Dhabi's unique cultural components are an asset that help to counterbalance some of the negative effects of globalization. &ldquo;The Emirate's cultural assets stimulate innovations that spring from our unique geographical setting, cultural history, and identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the more immediate future, Abu Dhabi is focusing on boosting sustainability in the economy by incentivizing investments in green energy and agribusiness sectors. The UAE is recognized as a regional leader in developing and deploying clean energy solutions and technology. With commitment to reduce its ecological footprint, transition to a climate-resilient green economy and ensure support through sustainable green finance. Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi, the UAE Minister of Climate Change and Environment, told TBY; &ldquo;Projects such Masdar send a strong message to the whole world that the country is making waves in the renewable energy sector&rdquo;. Tackling water shortage is one of the objectives of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment and its crown project is the world's largest reservoir for high-quality desalinated water, launched in January 2018.</p>
<p>In healthcare the major priorities for the Emirate include reducing capacity gaps, minimizing the need for international care, and attracting and maintaining local manpower. Sheikh Abdulla bin Mohammed Al Hamed, the Chairman of the Department of Health, was also quick to reiterate these strategic priorities when he spoke with TBY and outlined that &ldquo;The industry has evolved over the years into a mature, adaptable, and advanced system aligned with leading international systems in terms of practices, standards, and regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, TBY had also had the pleasure of discussing the creative industries, entrepreneurship and the media sector with Maryam Eid Al Mheiri, CEO of the Media Zone Authority &ndash; Abu Dhabi and of Twofour54, and its role in supporting the cultural eco-system of Emirate. She conveyed to TBY that &ldquo;Today we have a unique and vibrant creative community of more than 470 media companies and 580 freelancers. We also recently announced the extension of our entrepreneurship scheme to enable more small businesses to work from home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other prominent interviewees featured include: Juan Carlos Varela, President of the Republic of Panama; Abdulla Jassem bin Kalban, Managing Director &amp; CEO of Emirates Global Aluminium; Mohamed Juma Al Shamisi, CEO of Abu Dhabi Ports; Dr. Muhammed Nasser Al Ahbabi, Director General of the UAE Space Agency; Noura bint Mohammed Al Kaabi, Minister of Culture and Knowledge Development; and Mohamed Khalifa Al Mubarak, Chairman of the Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Neslihan Aydag&uuml;l, TBY's Managing Director for the GCC, spoke on the occasion of the launch. &ldquo;Abu Dhabi continues to offer investors a vibrant economy, a stable political system and a business-friendly regulatory environment. While the energy sector continues to dominate economic development, a growing diversification in the Emirate's economy is evident as Abu Dhabi strives for a more sustainable economy as articulated in its Economic Vision 2030. <em>The Business Year: Abu Dhabi 2019 </em>serves as a comprehensive guide for those wishing to do business in the Emirate.&rdquo;</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Lagos&mdash;TBY, a leading global media group specializing in economic research and business intelligence across emerging markets, sat down for a breakfast meeting with Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Lagos State's governorship candidate, for an interview to be featured in its upcoming edition of the country, The Business Year: Nigeria 2019.</p>
<p>In September 2018, Sanwo-Olu announced he would run for the office of the governor of Lagos State under the All Progressive Congress (APC), the political party President Muhammadu Buhari belongs to, at the elections that will take place in February 2019. The following month, he contested in and won the gubernatorial primaries against the incumbent governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, who was elected governor of Nigeria's largest state in 2015 under the same political party.</p>
<p>The result came as a surprise to Nigerians, as no candidate had ever challenged an incumbent governor after his/her first term as tradition in Lagos State has normally seen every governor win a second term in office. Therefore, with his victory in the primaries, Sanwo-Olu has already made history by becoming the new and only candidate for the incumbent party.</p>
<p>During a breakfast meeting, TBY's Country Editor for Nigeria, Silvia Lambiase, and Sanwo-Olu discussed what he would bring to the table for Lagosians and what his main economic policies would be, should he be elected as next Lagos State governor.<br />Sanwo-Olu stated that, with nearly two decades of experience in the private sector and over a decade of experience in the public sector, he brings a whole new fresh approach to politics.</p>
<p>He continued that when he joined the public sector in 2002 after working in the oil and gas sector, he was among the first technocrats in the government, and his deep understanding of the private sector led to the establishment of a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) office. His experience with PPPs and privatization are a valuable asset for a State with a high population growth rate and an infrastructure deficit that continues to hinder sustainable development. Sanwo-Olu then added: &ldquo;It is not about me, though. It is about Lagos. It is about the transformation and development I can bring to the State. We want to bring Lagos to a whole new level."</p>
<p>When asked what his government's main economic policies would be, Sanwo-Olu stated that the main focus would be public infrastructure: &ldquo;We need to ensure that public transportation and infrastructure in general are good. The rail system also needs to be completed, as does the highway infrastructure to connect Lagos to the West African coast."</p>
<p>Besides infrastructure, other priorities of his governorship would be energy and waste management, and lastly, the deployment of technology to develop the youth, improve healthcare and education, and leapfrog to rapidly catch up with developed nations.</p>
<p>He pointed out that the public sector only contributes around 20% to GDP and added that &ldquo;the right environment is needed to drive development and transformation. We want to maximize ease of doing business, cut red tape, and reduce inefficiencies."</p>
<p>The conversation then focused on other topics such as ways to obtain private sector funding, his plans to co-operate with private sector firms to clean up Lagos City, as well as the measures he would implement in order to harness the huge potential of the city's entertainment industry. &ldquo;Lagos is a city like no other, with a freshness and vivacity that is unmatched."</p>
<p>He stressed, however, that a challenge going forward will be to make the city more organized, including tracking the progress made, analyze areas where more resources should be dedicated, and enforcing that all citizens have an ID card in order to track the population and its movements. He concluded: &ldquo;Lagos is such a dynamic place that I really think we can use its size to push the entire country forward."</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2019</em>, which will be published in 1Q2019, will mark TBY's fifth anniversary in the West African country and will therefore be an unprecedented coverage of its economy, with analyses, infographics, and exclusive interviews with leaders across Nigeria's private and public sectors.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>The Business Year partners for the first time with the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Mexico to further its research on the country's economy.</p><p>Mexico City, November 5, 2018—The beginning of a new partnership between the Canadian Chamber of Commerce (CANCHAM) in Mexico and The Business Year was concreted on Monday at an MoU signing ceremony between Armando Ortega, President of Cancham, and Giulia di Loreto, TBY Country Manager. The ceremony marks the first collaboration between the two organizations.</p><p>TBY's latest publication aims to highlight the unique investment opportunities that lie within Mexico, Latin America's second biggest economy, via first-hand insights from leaders in the public and private sector. <br>Canadian companies play a unique role within Mexico as trade between the two countries has more than quadrupled since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1994 according to EDC, Canada's export credit agency. In 2016, Canadian direct investment in Mexico reached over CAD16.7 billion and Mexican direct investment in Canada totaled to CAD1.7 billion in the same year.</p><p>At the ceremony, Armando Ortega congratulated TBY on its work in the country so far. “The Business Year is an international media platform with a presence in a sophisticated niche of the business community," said CANCHAM's President. “We are sure that the agreement will be beneficial to our partners, and will also help reinforce the chamber's public presence." TBY's representative, Guilia Di Loreto, added that this is an opportunity to place emphasis on the great work being undertaken by Canadian companies in the country. “The partnership will further highlight the vision of Canadian entrepreneurs in next year's edition," she said.</p><p>CANCHAM aims to function as a link between the business communities in Mexico and Canada. “We are a platform that can be used by any Canadian doing business in Mexico. CANCHAM can help these companies find the right partner in Mexico to create a win-win business deal," Ortega stated during an exclusive interview with TBY. Mining is one of its main sectors of focus, followed by other energy industries such as oil and renewable energy.</p><p><em>The Business Year: Mexico 2019</em> launches in mid-2019, and will be the seventh edition published on Mexico's economy. The Business Year is global media group that specializes in economic news, research on national economies, and business intelligence. It has operations in over 35 countries.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Ras Al Khaimah, August 2018—TBY is pleased to announce the launch of its second ever comprehensive analysis on the economy of Ras Al Khaimah, produced in partnership with the Ras Al Khaimah Department of Economic Development (RAK DED) and the Ras Al Khaimah Media Office (RAKMO).</p><p>The publication will showcase the wide-ranging developments made throughout the year in every sector of the Emirate's economy.</p><p>In 2018, with the commemorative events in honor of the “Year of Zayed” in full swing, the already buoyant mood in Ras Al Khaimah soared even higher. The UAE organized a series of events to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, who played a critical role in the foundation of the country.</p><p>Thanks to its international airport, ports, free zones, and efficient highway network, Ras Al Khaimah is an attractive proposition for investors. Relatively cheap utilities and human resources also lower operational costs, making Ras Al Khaimah a more cost-effective alternative to some of its fellow Emirates. While manufacturing accounts of one-third of the GDP, the Emirate is boosting its tourism potential thanks to its mountainous landscape and pristine beaches. Moreover, stability and sound economic policies are two key features that make Ras Al Khaimah an important destination for investors looking to set up shop in the UAE. In addition, in 2018, S&amp;P and Fitch affirmed their positive 'A' sovereign credit rating for the country. </p><p><em>The Business Year: Ras Al Khaimah 2018</em> is opened by a foreword from Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah, on the Emirate's ambitions to diversify its economy and key initiatives that will drive development over the next decade. It will be followed by exclusive interviews with Abdulrhman Al Shayeb Al Naqbi, Director General of RAK DED; Sheikh Ahmed bin Saqr Al Qasimi, Chairman of RAKEZ; Peter England, CEO of RAKBANK; Abdallah Massaad, Group CEO of RAK Ceramics; and Haitham Mattar, CEO of the Ras Al Khaimah Tourism Development Authority (RAK TDA); among others.</p><p>“We were never truly reliant on the oil or carbon industry. We have always had to rely on being innovative and attracting a healthy balance between SMEs and industrialists,” outlined Ramy Jallad, Group CEO of RAKEZ. “While the manufacturing sector will still be a major source of economic development and diversification, Ras Al Khaimah's economic strategy is still to emphasize the importance of other sectors. For example, tourism is increasingly becoming more important and is expected to be a major source of growth in the medium-term,” added Abdulrhman Al Shayeb Al Naqbi, Director General of RAK DED.<br>These efforts are brought to light in TBY's extensive sector-by-sector coverage of the Emirate. The publication includes an infographic focusing on the growing infrastructure for adventure tourism, including the opening of the longest zipline in the world. In 2017, the overall number of tourists grew by 19%, while hotel occupancy is up by 3.5% with an average occupancy rate of 73.6%. “We have a stronger ground to showcase Ras Al Khaimah as the future hub of adventure tourism. That involves not only focusing on adventures but also wellness seekers and people who want to connect with culture, heritage, and history,” said Haitham Mattar, CEO of RAK TDA.</p><p>Moreover, the publication will highlight the Emirate's efforts in further developing its green economy with a new renewable energy and efficiency plan, its plans to revive the hydrocarbons sector, the enhancements of ports facilities, and the expanding opportunities in the real estate sector.</p><p>Ayse Valentin, CEO of TBY, commented, “<em>The Business Year: Ras Al Khaimah 2018</em> embodies our long-term commitment to continue communicating the opportunities and challenges of the Emirate's economy and its businesses. The stable outlook and growth of Ras Al Khaimah's economy is testament to a visionary governance of Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi. We are thrilled to launch this publication, with details of the latest and greatest business developments in Ras Al Khaimah.”<br>Heba Fatani, Executive Director of the RAK Media Office, said: </p><p>“Making informed, evidence-based decisions is critical for investors. That is why the Government of Ras Al Khaimah works with trusted partners like The Business Year to provide up-to-date, comprehensive insights and data that help to educate and inform investor audiences across the world. With this snapshot of the business landscape in the Emirate we can showcase the significant opportunities across key growth sectors and industries and help deliver on the vision of His Highness Sheikh Saud bin Saqr Al Qasimi to further develop the economy of Ras Al Khaimah.”</p>]]></body1content>

		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>Kuwait City, September 27, 2019— At an MoU signing ceremony, Hannelore Graf, President of the German Business Council in Kuwait (GBCK), and Ioana Popa, Kuwait Country Manager for the Business Year, sealed the beginning of collaboration between the two institutions during research for <em>The Business Year: Kuwait 2019</em>.</p><p>During an interview led by Kevin Delaplace Haro, Kuwait Country Editor, Hannelore Graf highlighted the key role of GBCK as a “bridge aiming to enhance the business collaboration between the Kuwaiti and the German speaking business community.” She added: “we have noticed that German businesses have an increased interest in Kuwait and that has also been reflected in our growing number of members and sponsors. Furthermore, Kuwait's 2035 national development plan will raise the profile of the country as a suitable destination for German FDI.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Ioana Popa stated: “we truly believe this collaboration will certainly benefit both parties since TBY will provide a complementary platform conveying the right message to the global business community.”</p><p>This partnership will allow German, Swiss, and Austrian companies to showcase, in the publication, their activities in Kuwait and discuss the challenges and opportunities they have encountered. At the same time, The Business Year will benefit from GBCK's extensive knowledge of the Kuwaiti business environment, which will be vital in shaping the publication.</p><p>On a final note, Hannelore Graf announced the second edition of GBCK's B6 initiative: “we are very proud to be arranging and participating again in the second B6 Summit at the Kuwaiti Opera House in October. This event will provide a unique meeting platform for all six business councils in Kuwait, their leadership, the local business community and the ambassadors to discuss Kuwait's economic panorama.”<em><br></em></p><p><em>The Business Year: Kuwait 2019</em> will highlight the new trends of the Kuwaiti economy as well as the numerous investment opportunities in sectors such as education, renewables and finance. The publication will comprise interviews with leaders of the public and private sectors, as well as selected data and analysis, and will be due for release early in next year.</p>]]></body0content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Mexico City, August 31st, 2018— TBY has launched its latest publication on Mexico, covering all the ins-and-outs about doing business in the United Mexican States. The Business Year: Mexico 2018 was published in partnership with the Mexican Business Council for Foreign Trade (COMCE).</p><p>The recent elections in Mexico are expected to bring some significant changes. After six years under Enrique Pena Nieto's presidency complete with landmark reforms in the energy sector, and  significant inflows of FDI, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (AMLP) is expected to bring considerable changes to the country's policy mix. The new President-elect has put forward his willingness to tackle corruption and impunity as well as roll back the reform in certain areas. If this rhetoric allowed him to win the elections with the absolute majority, his vision for Mexico is concerning certain investors who still fear the Obrador's ambitions are less business focused than his predecessor. According to TBY's analytics, a unique methodology whereby insight from interviewees is parsed using key word analysis to predict trends in the economy, the sector most affected by the elections was tourism, with over one third of all our executives in this sector mentioning related difficulties. Industry, on the other hand, was least affected, with just 10% of interviewees referring to election challenges.</p><p>However, certainly some changes are in store, as Obrador himself puts it in a foreword to the publication: “There will be deep changes, but according to the existing order. There will be entrepreneurial freedom, freedom of association, and freedom of belief‚Ä¶ In economic terms, the autonomy of the Bank of Mexico will be respected; the government will keep a financial and fiscal discipline; we will recognize the existing commitments toward companies and domestic and foreign banks."</p><p>With a forecasted growth of 2.3% in 2018 and 3% in 2019, Mexico's economy has been, and may well continue to be, essentially fuelled by its industry and tourism. The aerospace industry has experienced a significant growth. Queretaro is the best example of this, successfully having formed a prominent Aero-cluster to facilitate the interaction between Tier 1, 2 and 3 companies over the past year. Airbus, Zafran, Bombardier are among the top companies that have bet on Mexico in this sector. Furthermore, the government has created the Aeronautic University of Queretaro (UNAQ) in order to provide a big pool of young talents, highly qualified for these companies. Through a constant interaction and collaboration with the different firms and the Aerocluster, the UNAQ has focused its programs in order to match the needs of the market.</p><p>Mexico also became the seventh largest car producer in the world in 2015 and the country keeps attracting new brands. In fact, the Chinese car manufacturer JAC has invested MXN4.4million and partnered with Giant Motors and Inbursa to open a plant in Hidalgo in order to produce two types of SUVs for a young clientele. One of the reasons Mexico is so appealing for companies is its location; Radek Jelinek, President and CEO of Mercedes Benz Mexico told TBY: “there are two reasons for being in Mexico: to be part of NAFTA, which is important for the US and Canadian and Mexican markets, and because Mexico has [‚Ä¶] excellent quality, labor laws to be fast and flexible on decisions, a large pool of young people and great support from the different regions and the Mexican government."</p><p>Mexico's location is indeed a valuable asset; as are its 12 free trade agreements with 44 different countries. Once again, according to TBY's analytics 13% of interviewees mentioned geography and location as a strategic advantage for Mexico. However, 80% of the nation's exports are going towards the US, which means the outlook is challenging. With the NAFTA renegotiation and Trump's negative rhetoric about Mexico, it will be paramount for the country to start diversifying its exports destinations.</p><p>Another very important industry for Mexico's economy is tourism. This sector has been constantly increasing in the past three years with a number of tourists arrival going from 24.2 million (2013) to 35.1 million (2016). The Secretary of Tourism Enrique de la Madrid is now expecting 39 million visitors in 2018. René Aguado Martínez, from Mexico's Four Seasons Hotel commented on this growth in TBY's chapter: “Typically, Mexican beaches have been a magnet for guests around the world. Lately, other areas have followed suit, such as Mexico City, which has been found to be a top destination to travel to, not only for cultural or business reasons, but culinary and leisure ones as well." Julian Balbuena, President of the Board of Best Day Travel Group told TBY: “we have a great deal of natural wonders to showcase alongside our culture, cuisine, and diverse country". In fact, the country still has a significant margin for improvement if it can succeed in further developing areas such as cultural-, gastronomy- or eco-tourism. It can also expect greater flows of tourists once the new airport in Mexico City is finalized.</p><p>Other notable interviewees in The Business Year: Mexico 2018 include Fernando Ruiz Huarte, CEO of the Mexican Business Council of Foreign Trade, Investment and Technology (COMCE); Luz Adriana Ramírez Chávez, General Director of Visa México; Ernesto Ríos Patrón, Director General, Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo (IMP); John Donoghue, CEO, National Fiber Networks (NFN) Mexico; and Otto Granados Roldán, Secretary of Public Education.</p><p>There is still need for considerable reconstruction to repair damages caused by the violent earthquakes that have impacted Mexico City recently. Furthermore, there could be more investment made in oil infrastructures in order to limit high costs due to refining overseas. However, as TBY's CEO Ay≈üe Valentin pointed out while announcing the release of the publication, “Mexico has been progressively erasing its reputation for insecurity, and promoting one of diversity and prosperity. TBY continues its extensive coverage of Mexico's economy, with exclusive interviews that are full of vital insights for any discerning investor."</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Given its impact on changing the country's global image and its huge potential to bring major economic benefits, Nigeria's entertainment sector can become a very relevant piece of the country's economic puzzle. In light of this, The Business Year (TBY), a leading global media group specialising in economic resources and business intelligence across emerging and dynamic markets, has announced it will dedicate a full chapter to the entertainment sector in its upcoming edition on Nigeria's economy, <em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2019</em>, its fifth-anniversary edition on the West African country.</p>
<p>TBY has only partly covered Nigeria's music industry in previous editions; however, it has now recognized that the entire entertainment sector has enormous potential to bring significant economic benefits to the country through appropriate policies, and that given its far-reaching influence, entertainment is today one of the country's main expressions of soft power, a country's persuasive approach to international relations through its economic, cultural, and media influence in order to gain positive attraction.</p>
<p>Silvia Lambiase, Country Editor for Nigeria, stated: &ldquo;with Nigeria often being the subject of negative news headlines concerning security challenges, corruption, and precarity, we believe the country's international reputation does not always reflect the reality. There are always two sides to the story, and we want to tell the world the untold one. Lagos is Africa's true megacity; its energy, its vibrant lifestyle, and its high concentration of unique artistic talent are becoming increasingly influential abroad.&rdquo; She concluded: &ldquo;from Johannesburg to London, people are increasingly hungry for the Nigerian sound, meaning the entertainment sector's potential to change the country's image and play a bigger role in the economy can no longer be neglected. At TBY, this year we are excited to provide a first-hand insight into the current dynamics of the sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worth over USD5 billion and producing more films than Hollywood, Nollywood is today the second-largest movie industry in the world by volume after Bollywood and contributes 5% to Nigeria's GDP. It is also the second-largest employer in the country, proving its huge socio-economic impact. Cinema screens and Netflix in every corner of the continent and beyond feature Nollywood movies, thanks to which Nigerians have been able to influence viewers and export &ldquo;Nigerianness&rdquo;: their culture, their lifestyle and even their accent.</p>
<p>Nigeria's music industry, on the other hand, has yet to hit Nollywood's numbers, but within less than a decade it, too, has become an exceptional global phenomenon: in London, capital of the second-largest music market in the world, the rise of what many call UK afrobeats or Afro Bashment, a mix of hip hop and African sounds largely Nigerian-inspired, has revolutionized the music industry across the country. Major British artists with Nigerian or West African roots, some more established like Skepta, and others more recently-emerging like J-Hus and Not3s, have helped further expose the Nigerian sound to the world by initiating important collaborations with Nigerian musicians like Wizkid, arguably the continent's most famous singer, and other artistes like Mr Eazi and Maleek Berry. 2018 also saw a key new collaboration between Nigeria's Burnaboy and internationally-acclaimed pop star Lily Allen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afrobeat is putting Nigeria on the global map in a positive light. When you think about Afrobeat, the first country you think of is Nigeria. The top Afrobeat artists are from here. Our music is one of our proudest exports,&rdquo; said Falz the Bahd Guy, one of Nigeria's foremost rappers, who came under the international spotlight with his 2018 hit &ldquo;This is Nigeria,&rdquo; a remake of Childish Gambino's &ldquo;This is America,&rdquo; during an exclusive interview with TBY. He added: &ldquo;The coming to prominence of afrobeat worldwide is unbelievable. Now more than ever, many African songs and artists are being played all over the world. I travelled to Iran, for example, and African music was being played. It is amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to PwC, Nigeria's entertainment and media sector will be the fastest-growing in the world between 2017 and 2020. And this is in spite of the country's many challenges, from piracy to a lack of industry structure. One can only imagine the potential socio-economic impact of entertainment if more investment is spurred and the right policies are implemented. The government, too, has recognized it must take the entertainment business seriously if it is to diversify its revenue streams, and has therefore included entertainment as a top priority in its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan. The Business Year: Nigeria 2019, which will be released in 1Q2019, will take a closer look at the fundamentals of the entertainment business and analyze what is needed to harness this potential.</p>]]></body1content>

REUTERS/Henry Romero</em></p><p>Istanbul, 19 April 2018 — TBY's special report will highlight the private sector's role in advancing women's empowerment and will feature interviews with key business people from Turkey's leading companies striving for gender equality and women's empowerment.</p><p>Additionally, the report will seek overlap, where possible, with UN Women and the UN Global Compact's Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) initiative. The WEPs initiative creates a network of private-sector companies that dedicate efforts to fully empower women in economic life and across sectors.</p><p>As of March 2018, Turkey had the most companies that publicly declared their support for the gender equality principles of any country globally. TBY, committed to women's empowerment since its establishment in 2012, became an official WEPs member company in February 2018.</p><p>To become a member company, TBY's CEO Ay≈üe Valentin signed the CEO statement of support for the WEPs initiative. With regard to the special report, she emphasized, “we are extremely enthusiastic about this collaboration. The Business Year is an organization that holds issues of gender equality and female empowerment in considerable importance, as well as close to its heart. Our business is driven by strong and intelligent women. We are proud to note that our taskforce is over 60% female, making us an outlier for many businesses in our sphere. However, our dedication to this issue extends beyond our own walls, and that's where this partnership with UN Women, and the fruitful editorial coverage it will engender, comes into play."</p><p>UN Women Europe and Central Asia Regional Office (UN Women ECARO), through the WEPs initiative, and TBY, through its three previous annual publications (2013, 2014, and 2016) on Turkey's economy, together have an unparalleled network.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p></p><p><em>TBY's Paul Loomis moderated the panel.</em></p><p>Lagos, 21 June 2018—The Business Year (TBY), a leading media group publishing economic information and business intelligence in emerging markets, hosted a closed-door roundtable event titled “Gas for Development" on Tuesday at Eko Hotel in Lagos, in partnership with The Petroleum Club of Lagos, one of the foremost private members' clubs for leaders of the oil and gas industry. The event was part of The Business Year's Global Roundtable Series and was intended to provide a forum through which key stakeholders across the gas sector could profit from the space to discuss the main issues, both regulatory and market-based, affecting the gas industry in Nigeria. </p><p>The event was opened by Dr. Ebi Omatsola, an esteemed explorationist and geologist in the Nigerian oil and gas space, who delivered a presentation titled “Gas for Development: an Alternative Concept," highlighting some statistics on the Nigerian exploration and production environment and the most significant barriers to growth in the Nigerian gas sector. He touched on issues such as gas storage facilities and meeting the power demands of Nigerian households and businesses.</p><p>The roundtable discussion followed, featuring four key participants from across the gas sector: Gbite Adeniji, Senior Technical Adviser to the Minister of State of Petroleum Resources, Upstream &amp; Gas; Austin Avuru, CEO, Seplat; Tony Attah, CEO, NLNG; and Eddy van den Broeke, Chairman, Greenville Oil and Gas. The participants represented the regulatory arm of the government as well as the upstream and midstream segments of the gas sector.</p><p>The main topic discussed during the debate was the issue of gas pricing, which in Nigeria is controlled by the Federal Government. Gbite Adeniji defended the policy as crucial to the growth of the gas sector, while Austin Avuru unequivocally advocated a fully liberalized, market-based pricing regime. Tony Attah and Eddy van den Broeke, on the other hand, spoke on market pricing and the need to control costs for the benefit of the end consumers.</p><p>In particular, Gbite Adeniji stated: ““For most projects in Nigeria, gas is delivered at around USD 1 based on the intrinsic value of the natural gas liquids that is a prevalent feature of Nigerian gas. We have agreed that that priceing framework will change as the market develops. However, based on the understanding that this is a scale business and that the Nigerian market is significantly underdeveloped, we must first ensure that we have a baseload volume of gas in the market before we can start thinking of a fully-deregulated market. That is the rationale behind the government ensuring that gas, particularly for the power sector, is regulated, and that gas for the industrial sector is structured on the netback pricing model. </p><p>Paul Loomis, TBY's Regional Director and moderator of the roundtable, asked what the ultimate goal of a regulated gas price would be, to which Mr Adeniji answered: “The goal is to develop local capacity in the power sector, which should be the driver of the economy, therefore ensuring that the economics works for the power plants. We also want to ensure that other industrial projects such as fertilizer, chemical and other gas-related plants, would get off the ground." He summarized his view by saying that this is an interim measure pending the announcement of a market – led programme but that notwithstanding, the intent of the pricing policy is to ensure that the upstream is profitable, the midstream works, and the downstream off-takers can access gas at an affordable price, hence also protecting consumers.</p><p>Austin Avuru, on the other hand, expressed his disagreement by stating: “I do not like price regulation of any form. Price regulation as a transitional mechanism for introducing market pricing is welcome, when there is no gas supply to create a market. The problem with this approach in Nigeria, however, is that such transitional mechanisms become permanent."</p><p>Still on the pricing issue, Tony Attah said: “We are still looking for that optimal price of gas in Nigeria that will lead to the development of the country's gas resources. One would think that, as a buyer, I have a short-term view and would want to pay the lowest-possible price for gas. However, at NLNG we take a longer-term view and we adhere to the netback transfer pricing model, which gives us the flexibility to choose our supply accordingly. This is a willing buyer, willing seller pricing system."</p><p>Greenville's Eddy Van den Broeke stated: “I disagree with Mr. Avuru and Mr. Attah. In his presentation, Dr Omatsola showed that there are elements other than the price of gas that are important in developing the resource. For example, the industry is quickly switching to coal, so how can we have a higher gas price when coal is becoming increasingly competitive? Besides, with the level of poverty currently in Nigeria, there are people who cannot afford basic healthcare, so a higher price is not always a positive."</p><p>The discussion also addressed the issue of pipelines as well as exploration and production, and finalized with a series of policy recommendations. Each participant issued their predictions for their company and Nigeria's gas sector over the next 3-5 years. Charles Osezua, Board Member of the Petroleum Club and MD of OWEL Holding, gave the closing remarks.</p><p>The Business Year's Global Roundtable Series is a signature part of the approach taken in each country of operation. As TBY is a people-based and interview-focused media firm, the roundtable format aligns perfectly with TBY's editorial mission. The TBY Nigeria team is currently in the country to conduct research and interviews for the production of its fifth-anniversary edition, The Business Year: Nigeria 2019, and the “Gas for Development" roundtable was part of TBY's efforts to dedicate a whole special section of the edition to Nigeria's gas sector.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Jeddah, May 7, 2018&mdash;TBY recently conducted an interview with Dr Nabil bin Mohammed Al-Amoudi, Saudi Arabia's Minister of Transport and one of the Kingdom's key policy makers, for its upcoming edition on the country, <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018</em>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 maps out an all-encompassing economic transformation of the Kingdom, which includes a large-scale privatization agenda, transferring state assets to various companies. TBY recently met the Minister of Transport to discuss the priorities of the sector for 2018.</p>
<p>The Minister began by explaining, &ldquo;of all the elements of Vision 2030, two are key to the Ministry of Transport. The first of these is to see Saudi Arabia become a logistical hub and connect three continents. The second is to be the center of the Islamic world&ndash;as indeed we are&ndash;and enhance the Hajj and Umrah experience for people coming to the two holy sites.&rdquo; He also mentioned that the focus for 2018 has been in major infrastructure projects about to be completed, such as the King Abdulaziz Airport in Jeddah, and the Haramain High-Speed Railway.</p>
<p>Regarding the railways, the Minister explained, &ldquo;2018 is a year in which we are going to be merging the operations of the Saudi Railway Organization, which is a government organization, with the Saudi Railway Company (SAR), which is a government-owned company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, he was hopeful that by the end of the year the Ministry will be issuing its plea for private sector participation in some key segments of the railway.</p>
<p>Regarding the developments within the maritime sector, Dr. Al-Amoudi highlighted, &ldquo;we have already seen the fundamental, even paradigm, shift in how the ports operates, not just in terms of equipment, but more importantly in terms of processes, procedures, and digitization. We have been able to digitize much of our internal paperwork within the ports, customs, and with other government agencies. This has allowed us to reduce the number of processing days from 12 days to five days, with the aim of going down to three days, hopefully before the end of 2018.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Nabil bin Mohammed Al-Amoudi was appointed as Minister of Transport in October 2017.</p>
<p>TBY published its Saudi Arabia 2017 edition last September and is currently working on the fifth edition in the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of TBY, commented on the relevance of this research: &ldquo;Saudi Arabia has embarked on an ambitious transformation plan that needs to be supported by vast infrastructural investments, for which Minister Al-Amoudi has laid out a comprehensive master plan. As the Kingdom is opening up, there is increased attention from the global business community for economic coverage, and we believe <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018</em> will be the most comprehensive English-language guide to date.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 201</em>8 will be published in September.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The launch of SAP's Public Cloud Data Center represents the centerpiece of SAP's four-year investment plan for Saudi Arabia. The project has received a total of SAR285 million in IT infrastructure investment.</p>
<p>BMI Research estimates that with the new cloud technology, the Kingdom's IT market could grow to SAR33 billion in 2018 alone.</p>
<p>The Public Cloud Data Center is part of the Digital Hub, which also includes an open digital platform supporting entrepreneurship, co-innovation with customers, partners, and the wider ecosystem, the leveraging of cloud solutions to solve real world problems, and the production of local content to support the Saudi vision of digital transformation.</p>
<p>TBY is focusing on the digital transformation of Saudi Arabia in its forthcoming fifth annual edition on the Kingdom's economy, and was thus media partner to the launch.</p>
<p>Given the all-encompassing impact of technology on all other sectors, as well as on government administration and operations, digital transformation will be one of the key focal points of the publication.</p>
<p>Coverage thus far includes interviews with Minister of Communications and IT, Abdullah Al Swaha, the first interview in the IT chapter, as well as executives from Yesser E-Government, who discussed the development of a centralized e-portal, and representatives from the National Center for Digital Certification, who spoke about digitalizing and safeguarding the official interaction between the government and its citizens.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two other IT players, Thiqah and Takamol, have shed light on strategies for involving the private sector more in areas where the government has previously played a dominant role. KACST, TAQNIA, and other universities presented their vision on research agendas and the practical impact of technological innovation.</p>
<p>In the private sector, Zain, STC, Mobily, Lebara, and Virgin have all spoken to TBY on the telecommunications landscape and the anticipated impact of IoT and 5G.</p>
<p>SAP, along with CISCO, HPE, and Microsoft, the global giants, all share their stories in the publication, focusing on cloud technology and developing the necessary IT infrastructure. Together, this presents an overview of the wave of transformation being spearheaded as part of Vision 2030, and of which we can see tangible examples in Saudi society. The most obvious of these, of course, is SAP's Public Cloud Data Center, a new milestone for the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today's SAP Public Cloud Data Center launch marks the beginning of a new level of cloud-based digital solutions to accelerate transformation and competitiveness in the Kingdom, underscoring our commitment to Saudi Vision 2030," said Ahmed Al-Faifi, Senior Vice President and Managing Director, SAP Middle East North. &ldquo;Our in-country Public Cloud Data Center will enable Saudi public and private sector organizations to securely migrate their business to the digital sphere."</p>
<p>Using the SAP Public Cloud Data Center, organizations can adopt opex-friendly and scalable cloud solutions in any of 25 industries and 12 lines of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our investment in a Public Cloud Data Center is aimed at supporting the Kingdom's transformation into a leading digital economy, enabling young Saudi talent to innovate, and fostering the next generation of Saudi leaders," said Khaled Alsaleh, the newly appointed Managing Director for SAP Saudi Arabia. &ldquo;Saudi organizations using our SAP Public Cloud Data Center can optimize their budgets, and analyze data easily and securely for new levels of business innovation to excel."</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018</em> will be published in September 2018.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>On February 26, TBY met with the Governing Board members of the Kazakhstan Foreign Investors' Council Association (KFICA), a Council chaired by President of Republic of Kazakhstan Nazarbayev, to discuss how Kazakhstan may be affected by the China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).</p><p>With some of the country's leading policymakers, investors, consultants, and financiers, TBY's roundtable was organized jointly with the KFICA, and held at the Ritz Carlton Almaty. The KFICA represents the 33 investor companies selected by President Nursultan Nazarbayev to be members of his Foreign Investors' Council and to advise him and the Kazakhstan government on important investment issues.</p><p>The BRI is a trillion dollar infrastructure, transportation, and communication network connecting China with Europe via Central Asia and the Indian Ocean. Its visionaries hope it will be the new Silk Road of our times. As Erlan Khairov, Chairman of the Committee on Investments, Ministry of Investments and Development, explains, “it consists of a series of special priority projects between the two countries, some 51 undertakings worth a total USD27.7 billion."</p><p>Once completed, the BRI will crisscross Kazakhstan starting from its flagship project on the Kazakh-Chinese border, the Khorgos Dry Port, which supported by Chinese largest logistic company Cosco Shipping. </p><p>The roundtable speakers touched on many themes. Several commented on the opportunities provided by Kazakhstan's location. Agris Preimanis, the KFICA Governing Board Chairman and the Kazakhstan Country Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said, “the location of Kazakhstan used to be a disadvantage: it was far away from everywhere. Now, when you look at the Belt and Road Initiative, the complete opposite has occurred: It is the first country on the road from China to Europe."</p><p>Erlan Dosymbekov, KFICA Governing Board Treasurer, EY Managing Partner for Kazakhstan and Central Asia, highlighted that “Kazakhstan is positioned very well to be the driving force to make the region an attractive place to do business for investors, which is a great opportunity to diversify the economy."</p><p>Other roundtable participants noted the holistic impacts the BRI would have, since its benefits stretch to all economic sectors. For one, Curtis Masters, KFICA Governing Board Secretary, &amp; Director of Baker &amp; McKenzie, Almaty, said, “the most exciting thing about the BRI is that it is focused on areas such as finance, logistics, transportation, and digitalization, not natural resources."</p><p>Andrey Kurilin, KFICA Governing Board Member and CEO of Citibank, Kazakhstan also noted, “Once the Eurasian land bridge is in place, the biggest portion of it will go through Kazakhstan. This is when the whole New Silk Road will really start delivering practical dividends."</p><p>Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of TBY, commented that “TBY has long been following the ins and outs of the Kazakhstani economy. The BRI has been much awaited, and much discussed. However, TBY's roundtable has unpicked some of the more complex issues surrounding the initiative, framing different perspectives, and addressing the challenges and opportunities specific business segments may face."</p><p>Full coverage of the roundtable can be found in <em>The Business Year: Kazakhstan 2018</em>. This will be published in 1H2018 and will feature the views and insights of around 120 senior executives and government officials across all sectors, obtained through face-to-face interviews in the country. Besides such interviews, TBY will feature sector analyses, focus articles, and contributions from foreign guest speakers discussing their country's bilateral relations with Kazakhstan. The publication will be widely distributed both locally and internationally, as well as at major economic events, investment forums, and conferences.</p>]]></body1content>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The key to financial inclusion is in the palm of our hands, and TBY&rsquo;s Special Report on financial technology reveals the latest trends sweeping the industry.</p>]]></description>
		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>Istanbul, March 26, 2018&mdash;The Business Year has released its latest short feature report, the Fintech Special Report, following on from the success of its Smart Cities Report launched last year.</p>
<p>Fintech&mdash;or financial technology&mdash;is a trend changing practically everything about the way the world acts, interacts, and transacts financially. Figures from Statistica predict that, by 2020, there will be 2.87 billion smartphone users globally, constituting 36% of the predicted population. With barrier to entry radically lowered&mdash;indeed, many now hold the key to financial inclusion in the palm of their hands&mdash;it appears that fintech is democratizing money management, opening up the floor to more and more entrants in emerging economies specifically.</p>
<p>We are already flooded with information about the latest financial apps or the booming value of fintech unicorns, but we may find that there is an uneven spread of data, with many markets, regardless of respective fintech uptake, failing to make the headlines.</p>
<p>TBY brings you a spotlight report focusing on some of those underreported markets. We reveal trends by reflecting on the commonalities and differences across regions in order understand the bigger picture of why and how fintechs are garnering success in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The report focuses on three key sections: financial inclusion, with target markets such as migrants, women, and rural communities; problem solving, covering issues such as insurance penetration and access to finance; and solutions and governance, exploring PPPs in fintech, in particular using blockchain.</p>
<p>For this report TBY conducted over 70 interviews with high-level executives and public-sector officials dealing in fintech across the globe. Interviewees include HE Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM); Dmitry Karadin, Head of Special Projects, Smart City Lab at the IT department for Moscow City Government; Aaron Fu, Managing Director of MEST; Manuel Caldeira Cabral, Minister for Economy for Portugal; Tarek Assaad, Managing Partner of Ideavelopers and Young President's Organization (YPO) member; and Heather Strachan Matranga, Managing Director New Initiatives at Village Capital.</p>
<p>The coverage also features TBY's signature analytics excerpt, which parses quantitative data accumulated during interviews and transforms this into statistics using key word analysis. The special report is published in partnership with Techfoliance, a global provider of fintech insights and analysis.</p>
<p>Given that 62% of TBY's business leaders in the fintech space claim that we are moving toward a cashless economy, knowledge in this sector is in great demand. Moreover, seeing that 79% of business leaders suggest the best approach is a collaborative one, space for joint ventures in fintech is unbounded.</p>
<p>Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of TBY, commented on the launch of the report, saying &ldquo;the financial space is undergoing rapid changes, and continued coverage of the rise of fintech in mainstream media can be overwhelming for business people making their first incursions into the industry. As ever, TBY is pleased to act as a reliable and comprehensive voice for those looking for specific insight on the way that fintech is driving change in emerging markets, channeling the opinions of the people on the ground, making it happen."</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The latest edition on the Omani economy is now available.]]></description>
		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>Muscat, 26 March 2018—Gracing the bookshelves this week is <em>The Business Year: Oman 2018</em>, the most recent edition on the Omani economy produced by TBY in partnership with Ithraa, the Sultanate's Directorate General of Export Development.</p><p>The publication features over 150 interviews with top executives and government officials who highlight the wealth of business opportunities the country has to offer. Cutting the ribbon on <em>The Business Year: Oman 2018</em> is His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, who has led the country as it grows from economic strength to strength in the immediate wake of the Tanfeedh economic program implementation. This year's publication on Oman details the ambitions of Tanfeedh, its predicted impacts, and the opportunities it will generate for growth.</p><p>According to TBY Analytics Oman 2018, our unique methodology for parsing C-level opinion into crunchable data, the impacts of this robust economic program are already being felt. The average business confidence rating was 3.93, out of a possible 5 points, surpassing last year's average BCI of 3.82.</p><p>“The Sultanate, via the Ninth Five-Year Development Plan and Tanfeedh, has already identified five promising sectors for economic diversification: tourism, logistics, manufacturing, fisheries, and mining," outlined Khalid Ali Salim Al Senaidi, Head of Vision 2040 Office, a key unit involved in the drafting of the Sultanate's economic prospective plan for the medium-term. “The vision will continue to focus on these strategic sectors as it does not seek to re-invent the wheel," he went on, “but rather build on previous efforts undertaken by Oman."</p><p>These efforts are brought to light in TBY's extensive sector-by-sector coverage of the country. Knowledge sharing between TBY and the National Centre for Statistics and Information has given rise to an informative infographic on the changing profile of Oman's import-export mix. While total trade exchange has decreased in the last five years, new FDI laws and an overall friendlier business environment can help increase Oman's trade numbers again. In 2018 the total trade balance stood at OMR1.4 billion.</p><p>Ties—both diplomatic and economic—between Oman, Europe, and the Far East are also brought to the fore in the publication. Jüri Ratas, Prime Minister of Estonia, makes a guest appearance speaking of the extensive parallels between the two nations in pioneering digital services such as cyber security solutions, and in design and cosmetics. This edition also highlights how Oman's ties with Asian markets will continue to increase in prominence, with China and India poised to become increasingly crucial. Oman and China's continued joint efforts to create a formidable industrial hub at Duqm form a vital piece of this puzzle.</p><p>Other key government and private sector figures featured in The Business Year: Oman 2018 include HE Dr. Ali Masoud Ali Al Sunaidy, Minister of Commerce and Industry; HE Yahya Said Al Jabri, Chairman of the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm; HE Tahir Bin Salim Bin Abdullah Al Amri, Executive President of the Central Bank of Oman; Ahmed Saleh Al-Jahdhami, CEO, Oman Oil Refineries and Petroleum Industries Company; Dr. Khalid Mansoor Al-Zadjali, CEO of Oman Fisheries Company; and Andrew P. Long, CEO HSBC Bank Oman.</p><p>Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of TBY commented, “<em>The Business Year: Oman 2018</em> represents our five-year anniversary of covering the Sultanate. Half a decade's worth of growth and opportunities, as laid out in successive editions of TBY Oman publications, is testament to visionary governance, innovation, and successful management of natural resources. We are thrilled to launch this publication, with details of the latest and greatest business developments here in Oman."</p><p>The publication concludes with an executive guide, with details on the fiscal and legal landscape of Oman, and an interview with Mohamed A. Al Yahyaei, Senior Partner of Al Yahyaei and Salt, TBY's in-country law partners, who explains the practicalities of doing business in Oman</p>]]></body0content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>San José, 27 February 2018, TBY is pleased to announce the launch of <em>The Business Year: Costa Rica 2018</em>, produced in partnership with several in-country organizations: the Costa Rican American Chamber of Commerce, The Chamber of Commerce Costa Rica, The Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency, and Essential Costa Rica. </p><p>The publication features over 150 interviews with top executives and government officials who highlight the wealth of business opportunities the country has to offer. Costa Rica has hit headlines in recent years for all the right reasons; its solid green credentials, strong human resources, and increasingly high-tech manufacturing base put it in good stead to tackle the 21st century. </p><p>TBY's coverage highlights these key advantages. The publication is opened by setting up Costa Rica as a player on the world's stage, focusing on its influence in the Central American region, drawing on the words of Manuel Antonio González Sanz, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who commented: “the principles of democracy, freedom and human rights, and the environment are key. We have been critical of the Central America integration system and have pointed out the need for more transparency, accountability, and results."</p><p>Other key government and private sector figures featured in <em>The Business Year: Costa Rica 201</em>8 include Carlos Zacapa, Executive Director of Green Park Free Zone; Carols Obregón, CEO of Costa Rican Energy Institute (ICE); Jorge Sauma, General Manager of National Banana Corporation (Corbana); Mauricio Ventura, Minister of Tourism; and Therese Gearhart, President of Coca-Cola. </p><p>This year's publication contains comprehensive, sector-by- sector coverage of the challenges and opportunities that lay ahead for the future of the region's Green giant. The publication's special analytics insert shows that 65% of interviewees believe highly skilled labor is the key advantage to doing business in Costa Rica, while political stability and high-quality education come in a close second and third. </p><p>The publication also focuses on the headway made in advancing the country's IT sector. Commitment to the industry has made the country into a regional leader in telecoms and an important market for leaders in the industry. Johanna Escobar Guerra, the Country Manager for Telefónica Costa Rica told TBY, “We have grown 45% in the last year in B2B services in Costa Rica and our bet is to continue to focus on innovating our digital solutions to offer to the corporate segment‚Ä¶ It will be an interesting year for the telecoms sector and mobile operators due to the need to anticipate customers' requirements."</p><p>Ayse Valentin, TBY's CEO, commented that this edition of Costa Rica is released at a pivotal moment for the region. “With NAFTA currently changing the face of doing business in Central America, our Costa Rica publication is timely to say the least. The country is distinctive in many ways–at a regional, and global level–and can offer investors unique opportunities in this swiftly developing landscape, as long as they know where to look. TBY sheds vital light on these opportunities in this edition."</p><p>The publication concludes with an executive guide, with contributions from accountancy firms Grant Thornton and Moore Stephens, and law firm LatinAlliance, detailing the practicalities and pitfalls when it comes to investing in Costa Rica.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Riyadh, February 19, 2018&mdash;TBY, a global media group providing business and economic information on national economies through the eyes of the country's decision-makers, recently conducted an interview with Mohammed A. Al-Mowkley, Saudi Arabia's Deputy-Minister for Water Services and one of the Kingdom's key policy makers, for its upcoming edition on the country, <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018</em>.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 maps out an all-encompassing economic transformation of the Kingdom, which includes a large-scale privatization agenda, transferring state assets to various companies. The water sector is set to be the first to make this transition, including the seawater desalination and wastewater treatment sub-sectors. TBY recently sat down with the deputy minister of water services &amp; CEO of the National Water Company (NWC) to discuss the different models of privatization and to find out how the private sector can get involved.</p>
<p>He began by explaining the proposed timeline for these developments: &ldquo;we intend to take the privatization in two stages. Stage one entails issuing management contracts, followed by a concession of 25-30 years. The management contract means the contractor will take over the region or city for three to five years, depending on the complexity of the area. The contractor will evaluate the asset, manage the whole operation, and oversee all the manpower. During this period, the contractor will decide and vocalize the investment requirements so as to ensure the efficiency of the operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In terms of the CAPEX, the public sector will provide everything necessary during this period of time. However, the Deputy-Minister went on to explain that, &ldquo;once we move from a management contract to a concession, the contractor will take over everything. It will be responsible for the manpower and investing in CAPEX to manage the master plan, which will have previously received our approval. The contractor will, therefore, become the supervisor and operator of the water sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up until recently, the government has taken responsibility for all water project developments, while contracts were granted to private sector operators. From now on, this collaboration will be more dynamic, as Al-Mowkley continues: &ldquo;The benefit of having this model comes from the private sector, which has the expertise to run the water sector. It will level the efficiency of the sector and improve performance to higher levels than we are seeing today. We could do what the private sector is doing, but it might take 20 years to get there, while we expect the private sector to do the same work in half the amount of time. Finally, we will pay the private contractor based on a unit rate according to each cubic meter of water supplied or the wastewater being discharged. The other benefit of the private sector is that all the CAPEX can be deferred. We do not need any more funding from the government. The private contractor has to fund all the expansions and upgrades for brownfield and greenfield projects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is where the vast opportunities for the international contractors lie, as Al-Mowkley highlights. &ldquo;International operators and developers have the know-how and experience. At the same time, it is important that they partner with a local developer because the local developer has the knowledge of the market, connections to necessary organizations, and an understanding of the culture. When coupled, these two can form the perfect, complimentary partnership. Today, international players are in alliances with local developers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al-Mowkley sees an important role for NWC to monitor continued high standards while handing over the operations to the private sector. &ldquo;NWC has to leverage the entire efficiency factor, either in terms of the billing coverage, collections, costs, the way we operate, or project execution. If we go without spending enough time on efficiency improvement on everything we do, then the private sector will unquestionably charge additional costs because of these efficiency issues. We seek to minimize or reduce the gap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mohammed A. Al-Mowkley was appointed as Deputy Minister of Environment, Water, and Agriculture in 2016. Soon after this, he issued a resolution to merge water services throughout the regions with the NWC, of which he then became CEO. Al-Mowkley has vast experience in the industrial investment sector, having previously served as executive in the Obeikan Group.</p>
<p>TBY published its Saudi Arabia 2017 edition in September and is currently working on the fifth edition in the Kingdom. Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of TBY, comments on the relevance of this research: &ldquo;Saudi Arabia is currently undergoing a comprehensive economic transformation, and the Future Investment Initiative showed how the global business community is interested to get more involved. The achievements in the water sector in particular underline Kingdom's seriousness when it comes to its privatization agenda.&rdquo; <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2018</em> will be published in September.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Beirut, February 8, 2018&mdash; Early this month, TBY conducted an interview with Raed Khoury, the Lebanese Minister of Economy and Trade, to discuss Lebanon's current efforts to revamp the economy and the preparations undertaken by the ministry for 2018.</p>
<p>The interview was conducted as part and parcel of TBY's in-depth research into Lebanon's economy, which will form the basis of its publication, <em>The Business Year: Lebanon 2018</em>, due for release later this year.</p>
<p>Various topics came under the microscope throughout the course of the discussion. One such area of focus was Lebanon's endeavors to reduce its national debt, which currently stands at USD16 billion.</p>
<p>Also explored were the government's plan to further introduce incentives and protectionary measures to increase local production and reduce imports, vital for the country's overall economic health. Tying in with this is the Ministry's plan to present a new economic vision later in the year. At the moment, international consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Co. have been drafted in to advise on the early stages and continued development of such a vision. Raed Khoury dwelt on the significance of reforming the 2018 budget to reduce deficit, and ensure public spending remains within the country's outlined plans.</p>
<p>The Minister stressed the importance of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance projects, highlighting that creating the right environment for investors had been and would remain at the top of the agenda for the government. Currently, Lebanon ranks 122 in the World Bank's global ranking for ease of doing business.</p>
<p>Finally, Raed Khoury anticipated the impact the 'Paris IV' donor conference will have for Lebanon, proposed by the French government to aid its foreign partner in coping with continued its refugee influx. All of these topics are expected to be addressed by the government in the coming months and are expected to deliver results, as prioritized in the country's anticipated, new economic vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2018 could be a pivotal year for Lebanon, with the announcing of the new national economic vision and the Paris IV donor conference taking place in Paris during the month of March. TBY is anticipating rich and dynamic coverage from its Lebanon research team,&rdquo; said TBY CEO Ayse Valentin, as she reflected more broadly on the long-standing importance of Lebanon in TBY's overall global footprint.</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Lebanon 2018</em> will be a fundamental guide to the investment scenario of the country, including a focus on industry, transport, real estate, and tourism, among developments in other sectors. The publication will contain interviews with the key business leaders and representatives as well as reviews on every sector. The publication will be available in print and online.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TBY and Jonan opened with a discussion of the main challenges facing the Indonesian energy sector, broadly agreed to be one of the sources for future growth in the country. These include the lack of infrastructure capacity, which prevents many projects from going forward, and a need to keep costs of energy low to ensure competiveness. Jonan highlighted the measures the ministry is taking to ensure that electricity tariffs are as reasonable and affordable as possible, stating, &ldquo;we have to be a pioneer in many areas to increase opportunities for the expansion of the economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The conversation then moved to the Ministry's intentions with its new power purchasing regulations, modified by recent ministerial decrees to address risk levels for all parties involved. The aim of these decrees is to clarify and accelerate the process of any electricity investment. Jonan explained that while the new regulations might impact the bankability for independent power producer projects, the Ministry remained clear that, &ldquo;business risk itself cannot be borne by the government. While political risk falls under our responsibility, business risk has to be borne by the power plant company. The decrees address this issue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about the country's plans for renewables, the minister highlighted recent successes that shine light on possible areas for continued growth. Over the past 40 years, the Indonesian government has installed almost 5,000MW of renewable capacity, with 500MW worth of projects launched in the last 10 months alone. This shows that tariffs in renewables are competitive at a global level, leading to general interest in the region from foreign investors. However, the minister highlighted a need to render renewables projects as attractive&mdash;if not more so&mdash;than fossil fuels projects, in order to direct a steady flow of interest into this sector over the next few years. &ldquo;I tell the renewable energy unit of my department that 20-30% of total generation is the goal,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>TBY then gathered Jonan's comments on mineral exploration, and the best way to reconcile interests of Indonesia and foreign investors in this arena. The Minister was quick to highlight that the country's mining sector has been through ups and downs, but that at the end of the day, mined products&mdash; such as copper, nickel, bauxite, gold, and silver&mdash;remain plentiful. &ldquo;These are also following the market price,&rdquo; Jonan said, &ldquo;and that is the big parameter when it comes to how we can grow this investment in the mining sector. If the market is down, then foreign miners will demand a lot more concession or a lot more split so we have to make it acceptable. As long as it is in accordance with the mining laws and constitution, the rest can be negotiated from time to time, but if it is against the constitution then the answer is no and no. There should be no country that is ready to sacrifice its constitution for the interest of any mining company, and we stand by this motto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally, TBY asked the Minister about his outlook for Indonesia's energy sector. Electricity will play a key role, as the engine of growth, and the ministry will be safeguarding its availability, its competitive pricing, and its capacity. According to the minister, &ldquo;those three elements of the electricity will be supported and adjusted from time to time according to the demand. The government has a lot to do in regard to helping reduce the generation imbalance and the price of electricity in the country as the disparity between what people can afford and the cost is still significantly wide.&rdquo; Demand is expected to rise with an increase in electric cars and increases in domestic electricity usage for cooking. The private sector will be a cornerstone in the government's plans to meet this demand, and collaboration will be a top priority.</p>
<p>TBY's CEO Ayse Valentin commented that, &ldquo;as global demand for clean energy and electricity increases across the world, private-public collaboration will become a key feature in dynamic economies grappling with associated challenges. It is heartening to see that Indonesia is committed when it comes to joint ventures with the private sector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ignasius Jonan was appointed as the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources in October 2016. Prior to this, he served as the Minister of Transport. Jonan was previously a banker and chief executive of state railway company PT Kereta Api Indonesia. He holds an MA in international relations from Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Dodoma, December 5, 2017 – TBY is pleased to announce the launch of <em>The Business Year: Tanzania 2018</em>, the fourth edition on the country, produced in partnership with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, the British Business Group, and the Tanzanian National Business Council.  </p><p>The publication features over 150 interviews with top executives and government officials, and is opened by the words of His Excellency John Magufuli, President of the United Republic of Tanzania, driving Tanzania as it continues to emerge as a powerhouse of East Africa. “We promise to continue to address the challenges faced by our people to improve the working and living environments, and ensure all citizens benefit from the fruits of their labor," the President said.</p><p>This year's publication contains comprehensive, sector-by-sector coverage of the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in the coming year for Tanzania. With the country's Second National Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP II) now in full swing, several sectors of the economy are flourishing.</p><p>Transport is one such sector benefitting from increased governmental noncore spending, with many projects, like the works at Bagamoyo Port, and the renovations to Julius Nyerere International Airport, back on track. 2017 also saw the launch of the Dar Rapid Transit System, a cutting-edge public transportation system that has seen Dar es Salaam become the first African city to win the global Sustainable Transport Award.</p><p>IT is another key focus for Tanzania in 2018. With boosting financial inclusion top of the agenda for the Ministry of Finance, and the Bank of Tanzania, mobile money operators are a key part of the country's plans for economic growth, given their vital role, bringing in swathes of the unbanked population into the formal sector. Ian Ferrao, Managing Director of Vodacom Tanzania, said: “From a technology point of view, our vision is to lead Tanzania into the digital age and use the latest developments to continue changing lives here." What's more, 60% of our interviewees in the IT chapter revealed they are working to improve connectivity in rural areas. There are even signs that Tanzania's mobile money market could challenge neighboring tech giant Kenya's. “Using M-Pesa, we can turn Tanzania cashless faster than any other market." Ferrao emphasized.</p><p>Other key government and private sector figures featured in <em>The Business Year: Tanzania 2018</em> include Honorable Augustine Mahiga, Minister of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation, Professor Benno Ndulu, Governor of the Bank of Tanzania, Jared H. Zerbe, CEO of Tanzania International Container Terminal Services, Devota Mdachi, Managing Director of the Tanzania Tourist Board, and other key interviewees from all the sectors.</p><p>Geoffrey Mwambe, Executive Director of the Tanzania Investment Centre (TIC), highlighted the measures being put in place to boost ease of doing business in the country, and the publication ends with a practical guide to operating in Tanzania.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY presents Obikackson Group MD Dr. Ernest Azudialu-Obiejesi with the &ldquo;African Group of the Year&rdquo; award in recognition of the group's excellent performance despite the challenging economic environment, and its milestone inclusion in the London Stock Exchange's &ldquo;Companies to Inspire Africa&rdquo; report.</p>
<p>TBY has handed the award of &ldquo;African Group of the Year&rdquo; to Obijackson Group, represented by its Managing Director and founder, prominent Nigerian businessman Dr. Ernest Azudialu-Obiejesi. The award was given in recognition of the group's role in developing Nigeria's economy and in promoting the country's image globally. Despite a period of slow economic activity over the last few years, Obijackson Group has continued taking giant strides through significant investments in the country; among other investments, over the next three years the firm is seeking to invest USD200million in a power plant as well as a pipeline to convey gas to the power plant.</p>
<p>The selection of Obijackson Group as African Group of the Year by TBY management and readers was mainly driven by the firm's outstanding achievement when, in May 2017, three of its subsidiaries (namely Nestoil Limited, Energy Works Technology, and B&amp;Q Dredging) were included in the London Stock Exchange's &ldquo;Companies to Inspire Africa&rdquo; report, which showcases Africa's success stories to the investor and policymaker community in the global space. According to the World Bank's Treasurer, Arumah Oteh, the companies listed in the report are not only vital for their country's employment opportunities and sustainable economic growth, but they also represent the continent's best practices and good corporate governance despite the challenges they have to contend with, such as poor infrastructure and inadequate access to financing. Inclusion on the list, therefore, makes Obijackson Group a symbol of Nigerian excellence and a source of pride.</p>
<p>The award ceremony was held in Obijackson's offices in the iconic Nestoil Tower in Victoria Island, Lagos. Cristiana di Filippo, Country Manager in Nigeria, commended Dr. Azudialu-Obiejesi and handed him the award.</p>
<p>The Obijackson Group is one of Sub-Saharan Africa's fastest-growing conglomerates with operations in Nigeria, the US, and the UK across various sectors through its many divisions, namely oil and gas exploration and production, pressure vessel fabrication, power generation, dredging and marine logistics, aviation, civil and infrastructural construction, and real estate. It employs over 1,500 people.</p>
<p>Dr. Azudialu-Obiejesi first founded Obijackson West Africa Limited in the early 1980s, before diversifying into the oil and gas industry with Nestoil in 1991. Thanks to his visionary leadership and ability to build a successful conglomerate from the ground up, he has received numerous awards, including &ldquo;Entrepreneur of the Year,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oil and Gas Man of the Year,&rdquo; and &ldquo;West African Entrepreneur of the Year.&rdquo; Dr Azudialu-Obiejesi obtained his BSc in accountancy from the University of Benin, and was later honored by the University of Nigeria Nsukka with a doctorate in business administration.</p>
<p>TBY is currently conducting interviews for its fourth annual edition on the country, The Business Year: Nigeria 2018. Produced in partnership with the President's Office and the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the issue will include face-to-face interviews with over 130 of Nigeria's leading business and political figures.</p>]]></body1content>

Hassan Abdulrahman Al Ibrahim, Chief Tourism Development Officer of Qatar Tourism Authority, told TBY that “the economic impact of the tourism sector in Qatar is becoming increasingly visible."</p><p>Furthermore, this edition's coverage illustrates how diplomatic tensions in the region have seen Qatar strengthen ties further afield, and a range of voices from the international community, including Antonio Costa, Portugal's Prime Minister, and Teodor Melescanu, the Minister of Foreign Affairs for Romania, testify to this. Qatar is looking in particular to boost bilateral trade with Turkey. In an interview with TBY, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said, “relations between Turkey and Qatar will continue to grow deeper in the near future in a way that benefits both countries and the region at large. In fact, our mutual determination in this regard has raised relations between Turkey and Qatar to an exemplary level."</p><p>Other key government and private sector figures featured in The Business Year: Qatar 2017 include HE Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani, Minister of Economy and Commerce; HE Sheikh Abdulla Bin Saoud Al Thani, Governor of Qatar Central Bank; HE Akbar Al-Baker, Group CEO of Qatar Airways; Ian Gray, CEO of Vodafone Qatar; HE Skeikha Hind bint Hamad Al Thani, Vice Chairperson and CEO of Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development; and other key interviewees from all the sectors.</p><p>The publication ends with a legal guide to doing business in Qatar, composed by TBY's local legal partners, Al Sulaiti Law Firm.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY, a global media group providing business and economic information on national economies through the eyes of the country's decision-makers, recently interviewed in Abuja Hon. Babatunde Raji Fashola, Federal Minister of Power, Works and Housing.</p>
<p>TBY and Hon. Fashola discussed two major issues Nigeria is facing, the housing deficit and the power shortage, both of which are in the sphere of operations of the ministry. Regarding the ministry's policies to tackle the housing deficit, Hon. Fashola answered: &ldquo;I see the opportunity to build a real housing economy. The policy is clear: to create affordable housing, which morphs into various social housing concepts. Nigeria started pursuing this goal in the late 1970s, then we stopped. All we are trying to do now is to restart a national housing program." He added that the government currently has different housing designs for various parts of the country. &ldquo;We are building those designs in 33 states under a pilot scheme. Once we finish that, we will know what our total construction and infrastructure costs are, which in turn will determine how much the houses are worth in the market."</p>
<p>The conversation then moved to the issue of power supply and distribution in Nigeria. When asked to assess the power situation, Minister Fashola stated that the power shortage in Nigeria and fellow African countries simply stems from lack of investment, particularly since the attention shifted completely toward the oil and gas sector. &ldquo;The last major power plant I recall being built here was in 1985, followed one in the 1990s and another in 2006. Therefore, we have had decades of inaction during which our population has constantly grown." He then listed a number of projects that are set to increase Nigeria's power production by an additional 2,000MW within the next 15 months.</p>
<p>The discussion also touched on the issue of tariffs. When asked whether he agreed with some private players claiming electricity tariffs are not high enough to cover production and distribution costs, he answered: &ldquo;That is one argument. The other side of the story is that consumers are paying up to three times more than those tariffs through their own self-generation. The question is, what can you do to get the consumer to trust you with that money? The answer is you must provide the service, and you must meter consumers, otherwise they will be ready to self-generate power." He also added that another argument against tariffs being too low is that distribution companies should improve their collection rates. &ldquo;There is an assumption that the tariff is low when in fact the solution lies in collecting more from consumers who are not currently paying for their electricity." He added that his responsibility is not to favor businesses but &ldquo;to maintain the balance for consumers," clarifying, however, that in any case the ministry does not decide nor approve the tariffs.</p>
<p>He concluded the interview by expressing his optimistic outlook for 2018 as the year where the ministry's programs will start yielding their fruits. &ldquo;I think 2018 will be better than 2017 the same way 2017 was better than 2016, which shows the trajectory of policies&mdash;the government gaining momentum, and change really being imminent. I think in 2018 we will be measuring the results."</p>
<p>Hon. Fashola is a Nigerian lawyer and politician who served as Lagos State Governor from 2007 to 2015, when he was then appointed by President Buhari as Minister of Power, Works, and Housing.</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2018</em> will be published in 1Q2018 and will feature views and insights of about 120 senior executives and government officials across all sectors, obtained through face-to-face interviews in the country. TBY will also feature sector reviews, analyses, focus articles, and contributions from foreign guest speakers. The publication will be widely distributed locally and internationally at major economic forums, investment forums, and conferences across the world, therefore contributing to promoting Nigeria's investment climate.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY recently interviewed in Abuja Hon. Audu Innocent Ogbeh, Federal Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p>TBY and Hon Ogbeh discussed the country's path toward self-sufficiency, particularly with regards to rice: &ldquo;by YE2017 we will have achieved self-sufficiency in rice paddy production, but milling is still a challenge. However, we think by March-April 2018 we will have overcome this issue and there will be absolutely no need for Nigeria to import rice. So, in terms of domestic food supply we are heading towards self-sufficiency by mid-2018." The Minister also discussed the government's efforts to expand Nigeria's agricultural exports capacity. &ldquo;By 2030 Europe, China and India will be done with hydrocarbons. However, every country needs foreign reserves, so Nigeria must find something else to export." As for the crops with highest export potential, he mentioned cashew nuts and cocoa, but also sesame seeds, coconut oil, Shea butter, and castor oil for products such as cosmetics. With regards to Nigeria's exports destinations, he stated: &ldquo;We are looking at policies for exporting to India, where there is a demand and very exciting opportunities for these types of products. Then of course countries in the Middle East are looking for good quality meat; the market is quite big at 120,000 carcasses per week."</p>
<p>Asked about the potential of agriculture to drive economic growth, Chief Ogbeh answered: &ldquo;We are no longer going to lead the life of a lottery winner, as we did with oil; we are going to lead the life of a producer." He added: &ldquo;Nigeria has about 50 million hectares of uncultivated land and massive bodies of water and rivers. We are going to utilize our dams and lakes to make sure we can grow food all year."</p>
<p>Minister Ogbeh also touched on the participation of the youth to the country's agricultural sector: &ldquo;I am particularly grateful to the young people, they are responding beautifully. The average age of our farmers now is about 65 years old, so they do not have long to go. If we can mechanize and invite the younger generations into agriculture that energy hidden in Nigerians that has not been exploited before will come alive. We are very excited about tapping into this."</p>
<p>He also discussed the Ministry's measures to educate the public about a healthy and varied diet. Nigerians mainly consume carbohydrates, such as yam and cassava, but they should be aware that many other foods, such as vegetables and fruit, are necessary to their lifespan and immune system: &ldquo;Our children do not have enough milk, they should be having a pint a day for the brain and the brawn. A world driven by knowledge and intelligence must have people who can respond, invent, and create."<br />Lastly, he added that within a couple of years, the world will know and hear about Nigeria's food and agriculture.<br />Hon Ogbeh is a Nigerian politician and farmer who served as Chairman of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) from 2001 to 2005. In politics, he has held various ministerial positions, before being appointed Minister of Agriculture in November 2015, while maintaining his farming activities.</p>
<p>The Business Year: Nigeria 2018 will be published in 1Q2018 and will feature the insights of about 120 senior executives and government officials across all sectors, obtained through face-to-face interviews in the country. TBY will also feature sector reviews, analyses, focus articles, and contributions from foreign guest speakers.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY recently signed an MoU with the Mexican Business Council for Foreign Trade, Investment, and Technology (COMCE) on September 27 to cooperate on the publication of <em>The Business Year: Mexico 2018</em>, the seventh edition of the publication in the country.</p>
<p>The MoU was signed by Fernando Ruiz Huarte, CEO of COMCE, and Giulia Di Loreto, TBY Country Manager for Mexico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;COMCE's goal is to bring the best of Mexico to the world and to attract the best of the world to Mexico. Our partnership with TBY will help us achieve this goal," commented Mr. Ruiz Huarte on the partnership. Di Loreto, meanwhile, added, &ldquo;With the ongoing renegotiations with NAFTA and Mexico's goal of diversifying its foreign trade, our new partnership with COMCE will be vital for our coverage of these key issues."</p>
<p>The MoU comes after the interview with Mr. Ruiz Huarte, who reinforced the need to modernize NAFTA. He commented, &ldquo;We need to consider new topics that were not taken into account back in the 1990s in order to modernize the deal. For example, e-commerce, green energy, among others."</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Mexico 2018</em> will extensively cover the impact of NAFTA renegotiations, as well as the successes and challenges of the country's strategy to diversify and strengthen its trade partners within the recently signed TPP, the Pacific Alliance's Trade Agreement and the 46 other trade agreements Mexico has signed to date.</p>
<p><em>The Business Year: Mexico 2018</em> will be published in mid-2018 and will feature over 150 face-to-face interviews with the top private sector executives and public officials in the Mexican economy.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>Mexico City, September 18, 2017 – TBY is proud to announce the launch of <em>The Business Year: Mexico 2017</em>, the 6th edition on the country and produced in partnership with ProMéxico and the Executive Council of Global Companies (CEEG).</p><p>The publication features over 150 interviews with top executives and government officials, including an opening contribution from President Enrique Peña Nieto. </p><p>While outlining recent reforms in IT and telecommunications and its future role in Mexico, President Nieto states, “It is our responsibility to assure that we stay the course in the implementation of a framework of absolute transparency and accountability. Together, we will continue to broaden the boundaries of what is possible. Let us continue constructing a Mexico that is more prosperous, inclusive, competitive, productive, and most importantly, has more opportunities for its citizens."</p><p>Other key government and private sector figures featured in <em>The Business Year: Mexico 2017</em> include Ildefonso Guajardo, Secretary of Economy, Vincente Fox, former president of Mexico, Jaime Ruiz Sacristán, President of Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, Pedro Joaquín Coldwell, Secretary of Energy, Maria Teresa Arnal, Director General of Google, and Hiroshi Shimuzu, President of Honda de Mexico, among many others.</p><p>This year's publication contains comprehensive, sector-by-sector coverage of the challenges currently facing Mexican-US trade relations, as well as the opportunities that lay ahead for Mexico within the Pacific Alliance and toward East Asia. </p><p>Regarding the future of NAFTA, Secretary Guajardo commented, “NAFTA's revision should not be based on the idea that the agreement has only been beneficial to one of the signing partners, as NAFTA has brought benefits to all its parties; and we must maintain a trilateral perspective, under a “win-win-win" vision. Thus, NAFTA's modernization opens up a range of opportunities to strengthen North America, and lays the ground to make it more prosperous, sustainable and inclusive."</p><p>When asked what Mexico could do to reassure investors regarding Mexican-US relations, former president Fox added, “It is not Mexico who caused this turmoil. It is the disrupter and the destroyer also known as Trump who decided to break all the written rules of the economy. He has harmed Mexico, the US' main partner, too much, and he believes by patting our back he can go back to how things were before." </p><p><em>The Business Year: Mexico 2017</em> also includes key excerpts and highlights from a CEO Round Table event organized in collaboration with ProMéxico and CEEG. </p><p>This event gathered important personalities in Mexican business, including Frederic García, General Director of Airbus Mexico and President of CEEG Francisco González Díaz, former General Director of ProMéxico; Eduardo Solís, President of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association, among others.

He explains how, “Sustainability continues to be a key focus for us. We have completed the second phase of the Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, an USD13.6 billion investment, which by 2030 will become the largest single-site solar park in the world."</p><p>The publication features face-to-face interviews with key government officials such as Hamad Al Buamim, CEO and President of Dubai Chamber and Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman &amp; CEO of DP World, who shared their thoughts on the Emirate's drive for further diversification, boosting global competitiveness, and sustainability</p><p>This year's publication includes additional coverage of the Emirate's drive to be a smart, knowledge-driven economy.

As Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of Dubai FDI, explained,  “The Dubai government has established clear signposts for development plans and strategic initiatives across key growth sectors that provide unique investment opportunities, ranging from healthcare and education to tourism, aviation, transport, information and communications technology, manufacturing, finance, and renewable energy. The government is providing both hard and soft infrastructure needed for business success."<br> <br>The sentiment was echoed by His Highness Sheik Mohammed, who outlined his driving philosophy, “As a government, we know that a society cannot be sustained without a culture of giving and a sense of community responsibility among both people and organizations. HH Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE, declared 2017 as the 'Year of Giving.' The spirit of giving is embedded in the UAE's heritage and culture, and the government seeks to work with the private sector closely to instill this even more deeply in our social fabric. This ethos of cooperation and partnership is what we seek to convey to the world as Expo 2020 draws closer."</p><p>Dubai's economic accomplishments and its rise up the World Business Doing Business report bear testament to its spirit of innovation. The Business Year Dubai 2017 pulls together numerous voices from across the economy working to build the future of Dubai, and endeavoring to make it the smartest, most innovative, and happiest city in the world.</p><p>TBY is a global media and research firm, present in over 25 countries.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><br></p><p>Leading global media and research firm TBY organized an exclusive event at the Eko Hotel &amp; Suites on August 7, 2017, entitled “Harnessing Digitalization in Nigeria's Financial Sector," in conjuction with the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Leland Rice, TBY's Editor-in-Chief, moderated a thorough dialog between Mr. Oscar Onyema, CEO of the Nigeria Stock Exchange; Mr. Uzome Dozie, CEO of Diamond Bank; Tayo Oviosu, CEO of PAGA; Juliet Nwanguma, Country Manager of PayU; Valentin Obi, CEO of eTranzact; and Muda Yusuf, Director General of LCCI. </p><p>Reducing costs and driving client-oriented innovation were at the center of the discussion, with attendees engaging in a lively debate over the role of banks and regulators to streamline financial transactions. According to Mr. Dozie, in the last 20 years the banking sector has evolved and adjusted to market conditions, stating, “It took Diamond Bank 23 years to acquire 7 million customers using 300 branches and in the last two years it took no branches to acquire another 7 million customers by partnership and collaboration." Digital infrastructure is thus a necessary tool to merge the needs of financial institutions and clients. Mr. Obi agrees on the progress of the Nigerian banking sector, and insisted on the excessive costs of a cash-based economy and the importance of data in providing financing tools. He expressed, “How we analyze the data will help in the situation of lending." On the same note, Mr. Onyema added, “We have to find new ways to provide capital to firms that are looking for equity", to which Mr. Oviosu answered that providing capital needs to go through implementation of a distribution network that accesses the mass market.</p><p>TBY and the speakers also discussed the role of Fintech companies and their relationships with banks and the role of regulators. On the matter, Ms. Nwanguma admitted the need for Fintech companies and banks to cooperate since they both need each other, emphasizing banks' role in working with end-users and fintech companies' role in developing payment processing technologies. Collaboration with the regulators is also deemed to be crucial, as new Fintech actors are unable to grow and operate in the long-term without rules of engagement. Innovation has to be sustained, creating a scheme of tax incentives and facilitating access to financing, especially for SMEs. Financing channels are thus a priority, but Mr. Yusuf argued that technology needs to be implemented cautiously, as it might disrupt jobs. On the other side of the spectrum, Mr. Dozie reasserted the essential role technology and digitalization play in streamlining lending structures and expanding lines of business, which eventually leads to jobs creation. The continued debate among the guest speakers was further witness to the relevance the subject holds in Nigeria in both the financial and technological world.</p><p><em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2018</em> will be published in 1H2018 and will feature the views and insights of around 120 senior executives and government officials across all sectors, obtained through face-to-face interviews in the country. Besides such interviews, TBY will feature sector analyses, focus articles and contributions from foreign Guest Speakers discussing their country's bilateral relations with Nigeria. The publication will be widely distributed both locally and internationally, as well as at major economic events, investment forums, and conferences globally.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p></p><p>LAGOS, July 19th, 2017, LEADING international publisher of economic reviews on national economies, TBY, recently interviewed Senator Udoma Udo Udoma, Hon. Minister of Budget and National Planning in Abuja.</p><p>TBY and the Minister discussed the Implementation Plan (IP) of the much-awaited Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), launched by President Buhari in early 2017. The Minister explained how there are four steps to the implementation of the program. The first is accountability: each Ministry will be responsible and accountable for each key activity enunciated in the plan. Secondly, a thorough planning process will be implemented. “We set broad targets which are going to be further developed into more detailed targets." The third step is the mobilization of resources to support these targets, which will be allocated directly from the Ministry of Budget and National Planning. Lastly, the IP will involve monitoring and evaluation. “We have set up a delivery unit, both in this Ministry and in the Presidency, to monitor, evaluate, as well as drive the process. Somebody has to monitor what is being done, report on that, and drive and support those working."</p><p>During the interview with TBY, Minister Udoma also discussed the methods by which, in an era of lower commodity prices, the Federal Government (FG) is planning to increase its revenue as well as to identify alternative revenue streams. Firstly, the FG plans to maximize its revenues from oil and gas. Secondly, the FG is looking at non-oil revenues, in particular the ones generated by the various government agencies. He explained: “What we are doing is insisting that [the government agencies] provide budgets to us, on time, which we scrutinize, and we try to go through the projects and reduce some of the waste." Another alternative stream of revenue that the FG is trying to further develop is revenue collection with customs, as well as companies income tax and VAT, through the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Lastly, the FG is determined to grow sectors such as agriculture, solid minerals, and manufacturing that can create non-hydrocarbon-based revenues. Minister Udoma said: “One of the ways we are doing this is by increasing our expenditure on infrastructure, railways and roads, and power, so that we can increase the level of activities in agriculture, manufacturing, solid minerals, entertainment, and services."</p><p>Minister Udoma assumed office in November 2015. The Ministry of Budget and National Planning is the body in charge of the ERGP and its implementation, which is expected to re-launch Nigeria's economy and whose target, among others, is 7% GDP growth by 2020.</p><p><em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2018</em> will be published in 1Q2018 and will feature the views and insights of around 120 senior executives and government officials across all sectors, obtained through face-to-face interviews in the country. Besides such interviews, TBY will feature sector analyses, focus articles and contributions from foreign Guest Speakers discussing their country's bilateral relations with Nigeria. The publication will be widely distributed both locally and internationally at major economic forums, investment forums, and conferences all over the world, therefore greatly contributing to promoting the country's image.</p>]]></body1content>

<p>TBY and the Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development (ITHRAA) of Oman renewed their partnership to produce TBY's fifth edition on the Sultanate, The Business Year: Oman 2018.</p>
<p>Sof&iacute;a Marrero, Regional Director of TBY, and Taleb Al Makhmari, Director General of Marketing and Media of ITHRAA, signed the partnership, which seeks to continue promoting Oman and attracting further foreign direct investment into the country.</p>
<p>In order to cover His Majesty's plan to diversify the economy, and the subsequent implementation of Phase I of the National Program for Enhancing Economic Diversification (Tanfeedh), TBY has focused on meeting the country's main public officials as well as some of the most prominent executives of the private sector.</p>
<p>According to a statement given by His Excellency Hamood Sangour Al Zandlaji, Executive President of the Central Bank of Oman, &ldquo;Authorities have been taking policy measures to move ahead on the path of fiscal sustainability in the medium-term. Reining in public expenditure, augmenting non-oil revenue, and pursuing economic diversification are the key facets of the State General Budget, 2017.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In regards to FDI, His Excellency Abdullah Salim Al Salmi, Executive President of the Capital Market Authority explained how &ldquo;Oman has the highest amount of foreign capital market participation in the GCC, with around 30% of the total capital owned by foreign investors. Because of this, Oman can be considered the most open market in the region when it comes to ease of access.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TBY also met with Tarik Al Junaidi, CEO of Oman Shipping Company, who noted, &ldquo;Oman Shipping Company will be focusing mostly on the local market, specifically in Duqm and the transportation needs of its upcoming projects; in general, Oman Shipping Company wants to focus on the export and import of Omani products.&rdquo; In addition, Chee Khian Lee, CEO of the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD), mentioned, &ldquo;The key investment that we want to bring in is the petrochemical segment as the Oman-Kuwait refinery is coming up. The refinery will be a main player supporting the industry and if there is more than one refinery the economy will thrive. There is the manufacturing side with heavy industry and dry docks that will share the same supporting factor on the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When asked about SMEs and their input on the local economy, Khalid bin Al Safi Al Haribi, Acting CEO of the Public Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises Development (Riyada), mentioned, &ldquo;2017-2018 are the years of shifting gears; Riyada's main focus is to ensure that SMEs are being developed properly, and that they are so successful that it inspires the whole country to follow these steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TBY is the leading research firm and publisher of annual economic resources on national economies, present in over 25 countries. Each country-specific edition contains a comprehensive range of interviews and analyses, offering an inside look at doing business in the world's most dynamic economies.

<p>The American Lebanese Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) and the Association of Lebanese Business People in the World (RDCL World) teamed up with TBY for a roundtable titled &ldquo;The Role of the Private Sector in Sustainable Power Generation" on May 23, 2017. Held in Beirut, the forum was moderated by TBY's Editor-in-Chief Leland Rice and featured Dr. Fouad Zmokhol, President of the "Association of the Lebanese Business People in the World" (RDCL World); Salim Zeenni, Chairman of the American Lebanese Chamber of Commerce (AmCham); Pierre El Khoury, President of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation; Karim Osseiran, Senior Energy Expert at Ministry of Energy and Water Resources; Dr. Hassan Harajli, Project Manager at UNDP &ndash; CEDRO; Antoine Skayem, CEO of Riego; Hussam Hawwa, CEO of Difaf; Albert Khoury, CEO of Hawa Akkar.</p>
<p>Historically dependent on imported fossil fuels, with oil accounting for over 95% of energy generation, Lebanon aims to double its share of renewable energy to 12% by 2020 and slash energy demand by 5% through increased efficiency. The roundtable highlighted the private sector's role in achieving these energy goals through developing new technology, incentivizing investments, and creating more PPPs.</p>
<p>Beginning the discussion, Pierre El Khoury promised that Lebanon will accomplish its 2020 goals. &ldquo;Approximately 3% of the 12% is going to be covered by solar water heaters. Lebanon is among the top 10 countries in this regard. Currently the private sector is in the process of preparing proposals to build solar farms that will generate 180MW. The other part of the 12% is dedicated to wind farms." This follows the Ministry of Energy and Water starting a wind energy procurement process in March 2013, requesting wind farms be built and operated under a power purchase agreement (PPA). Albert Khoury, a pioneer in the implementation of wind farms in Lebanon, praised the Ministry's support but acknowledged some challenges still need to be addressed. Karim Osseiran referred to the importance of PPPs, saying, &ldquo;For a successful private-public partnership, both parties must be strong."</p>
<p>The funds provided by the Central Bank through the National Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA) program was another topic of discussion. &ldquo;We have a company whose business model is to go through the Central Bank financing mechanism. If the Central Bank stops subsidies, the market would be dead," Albert Khoury explained. Dr. Fouad Zmokhol raised the importance of infrastructure and how it is vital for the sector to develop further; &ldquo;We have to admit there is not much infrastructure from the public sector. When we discuss the importance of sustainable and renewal energy for the private sector, it is no longer a choice."</p>
<p>TBY, the American Lebanese Chamber of Commerce, and The Association of Lebanese Business People in the World (RDCL World) expressed their gratitude to the participants and their satisfaction with the result of the discussion. The full text of the roundtable discussion will be published in<em> The Business Year: Lebanon 2017</em>.</p>]]></body1content>

Regarding African-GCC cooperation, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta stated, “Increased cooperation between the two nations would allow Oman not only to access the region, but also to the growing Kenyan market and the improving investment environment." Furthermore, regarding Asia-GCC relations, Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha stated, "There is no doubt Oman can be a strategic partner, linking Thailand with the Middle East and the wider region of Africa... Thailand can also be Oman's gateway to other ASEAN countries and the wider Asian countries."</p><p>Betül Çakaloğlu, Regional Director of The Business Year, also offered her words on the release of <em>The Business Year: Oman 2017</em> and the importance of working with Ithraa, “Our partner's leadership and know-how have been central to our Omani publications and their impact on the global investor community, and we hope to maintain this partnership as we continue to focus on highlighting the Sultanate's investment potential."</p><p>The project's supporting partners, RSM and Yahyaei and Salt, also contributed immensely in the facilitation of important statistics on exports, business environment and legal background, all important topics to further encourage local and foreign investors to choose Oman as a prime, business hub in the GCC/Middle East. As explained by George Matheus, Managing Partner of RSM, “At RSM, we build strong relationships based on deep understanding of what matters most to our clients. It is the strong, collaborative approach that differentiates RSM firms worldwide.

The event gathered some of the most prominent senior executives of Qatar to discuss the role of this model within the country's economic development as well as the importance of creating a legal framework governing the use of PPPs.</p><p>The roundtable opened with a keynote speech from H.E. Sultan bin Rashid Al Khater, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Economy &amp; Commerce, who mentioned that the Ministry is drafting a PPP law, also PPP projects were already launched in the education and healthcare sectors and achieved major mile-stones in cooperation with other Ministries such as the Ministry of Education &amp; Higher Education and the Ministry of Public Health.</p><p>The speech was followed by a panel discussion between different stakeholders from the public and private sector: Mr. Fahad Rashid Al-Kaabi, CEO of Manateq; Mr. Abdulrahman Essa Al-Mannai, President &amp; CEO of MILAHA; Ms. Mira Al-Attiyah, CEO of QNB Capital; Eng.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>On March 22, TBY attended the International Government Communication Forum, which took place under the patronage of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Mohammed Al Qasimi, Supreme Council Member and Ruler of Sharjah, in the northern Emirate.<span></span></p><p>At the start of the event His Highness gave the keynote address. He began by recounting his vision and the humble roots of the International Government Communication Forum. He narrated how the event had begun 32 years ago when the first children's center in Sharjah was built. The idea was that hosting such an event would help round the education of young Emiratis, giving them a global perspective that would be the foundation of success in the Emirate. He finished his address by saying that “for true societal development, humans must be the source and core focus of such inclusive development, regardless of ethnicity and background." </p><p>Al Gore, Chairman of the Climate Reality Project and former Vice President of the United States, was the next to take the stage, where he detailed the climate problems currently the facing planet. He said that it is crucial to address the lack of understanding and denial as only “38% of people understand the problem," and “21% think it will affect them personally." Gore then explained how the ongoing conflict in Syria was caused primarily not by civil disputes or ethnic conflicts but by a record-breaking drought in the Eastern Mediterranean that produced a staggering 1.5 million climate refugees. He reiterated that without public awareness, international cooperation, and a quick global response, less stable governments in climate vulnerable regions are at severe risk of climate-related conflicts.</p><p>On behalf of HE Ilham Aliyev, President of Azerbaijan, HE Ali Ahmadov, Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan spoke of the importance of economic diversification and the value of strong bilateral relations in addressing global problems. His Excellency spoke about initiatives to develop the non-oil economy starting with expanding education, access to healthcare, and social services. Ahmadov stressed that the biggest challenges of our lifetime, poverty, disease, inequality, environmental imbalance, and terrorism, must be addressed with strong international cooperation. He commended Sharjah and the UAE for hosting such an event to discuss such important and far-reaching issues.</p><p>HE Sheikh Sultan bin Ahmed Al Qasimi, Chairman of Sharjah Media Council took the occasion to introduce the International Government Communication Centre, a “first-of-its-kind academic establishment that will serve as a local, regional, and international reference point for government communications." He asked the audience to recount the bloody events of this world and look at them not as obstacles but as opportunities for cooperation and success in helping others.</p><p>The Forum emphasized the necessity of international cooperation and transparent and open communication between all attendees, be that Nobel Prize winners, CEOs, ministers, heads of state and academics in addressing the problems facing the world of today and tomorrow.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><span style="background-color: initial;"><br></span></p><p><span style="background-color: initial;">The American Chamber of Commerce in Kazakhstan and TBY</span><span style="background-color: initial;"> jointly organized a roundtable with the heads of leading financial institutions in the country to discuss the current status of banking and their vision of the sector's development. The event was hosted by Doris Bradbury, AmCham's Executive Director, and moderated by Leland Rice, TBY's E</span><span style="background-color: initial;">ditor-in-C</span><span style="background-color: initial;">hief, and saw the attendance of Gordon Hasking, CEO of Al Hilal Bank; Aiman Mukanova, Director at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi; Sabit </span>Khakimzhanov, Head of Financial Stability of the National Bank of Kazakhstan; Andrey Kurilin, CEO of Citibank Kazakhstan; Aigul Djailaubekova, Deputy Chairperson of Tsesnabank; Valeriy Khegay, Head of Market Data for Kazakhstan Stock Exchange; and Gani Uzbekov, CEO of Capital Bank.</p><p>Mr. Rice welcomed the attendees by stating: “After seven years of TBY operations here, we have seen demand for information on Kazakhstan continue to grow. This reflects Kazakhstan's changing role in the world, with major cross-border transportation deals, Expo 2017, hosting of the Syrian peace talks, and, in particular, reform and transition in the banking sector."</p><p>The opening topic was regulatory changes put in place by the National Bank since 2014, and how these have affected commercial banks. From the regulator's side, Mr. Khakimshavnon said the main policies have yet to be implemented, as the biggest issue facing Kazakhstan's banking sector is uncertainty surrounding the quality of assets. From the viewpoint of commercial banks, Ms. Djailaubekova explained how the National Bank's tightening regulations on capital requirements, although essential during an economic downturn, can represent a challenge for banks. Nevertheless Tsesnabank's growth demonstrates how its operations have not been significantly affected by such regulations. </p><p>Banking sector consolidation has been another widely discussed topic in Kazakhstan in the last few months. Ms. Djailaubekova explained that talks regarding a potential Qazkom-Halyk Bank merger—which would effectively create a “superbank"—may have positive effects on reducing costs through a larger market share. On the other hand, she noted, a large combined lending portfolio needs sufficient capitalization to be handled.</p><p>Mr. Kurilin expressed his view that there is no consensus on the ideal number of banks that should operate in an economy. “It is the underlying economy, rather than temporary factors such as the exchange rate or inflation, that really determines the volume of banking assets and the number of banks in an industry."</p><p>Capital Bank's Mr. Uzbekov said: “It is interesting to hear that CEOs of big banks are for consolidation, as in my opinion small banks should exist as they are disruptors. For us, innovation is a matter of survival, whereas for big banks it is not essential since they will always rely on a fixed stream of revenue."</p><p>On the topic of smaller banks being disruptors, Mr. Hasking described how Al Hilal Bank plays a similar role by also offering an alternative platform, namely Islamic banking. He said that despite the bank's currently marginal role in the market, some clients are attracted to its products not necessarily because of their Islamic nature, but rather because of “the security of a state [Abu Dhabi]-owned institution rated A+, which itself can be attractive to people concerned about the current state of the local market." Mr. Hasking also announced that Al Hilal would commence retail banking operations in Kazakhstan in 2017.</p><p>Mr. Rice then gave the floor to Mr. Khegay from the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange to discuss the main developments in the stock market. Mr. Khegay explained that inclusion on the stock exchange can be a valid alternative to bank credits, but “unfortunately the degree of the local stock market involvement in the economic processes still remains quite low." He listed lack of awareness and financial education as the primary causes of this.</p><p>Ms. Mukanova, representing the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which only deals with foreign currency, expressed her agreement with other participants on the need to further develop the stock market. “We would like to be able to fund our operations in tenge and we would like a tenge-to-foreign currency market and to have both local and foreign investors happy to invest locally."<br>When Mr. Rice asked attendees to share their outlook on 2017, the general sentiment was cautiously optimistic regarding oil prices. As Kazakhstan further integrates in the world economy, there will be a need to closely monitor other increasingly influential external factors, such as the implications of US President Trump's foreign policy as well as elections in major European economies.</p><p>From a domestic economy point of view, the speakers called for a well-defined approach of the National Bank towards the issue of non-performing loans, easier labor laws to encourage immigration, the acceleration of government reforms, and the prompt implementation of the privatization program.</p><p>A video teaser of the roundtable will be available on <a href="http://www.thebusinessyear.com">www.thebusinessyear.com</a>, while extended coverage will be featured in the upcoming edition of The Business Year: Kazakhstan 2017.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body0content><![CDATA[<p>Leading Mexican business magazine Expansión recently published an article based on research done by TBY on the recent bilateral aviation agreement between Mexico and the US. This agreement was signed in December 2015 and came into effect in August 2016. It allows any airline to fly between cities in both countries. In the past, only two airlines were allowed to serve each destination.</p><p>Expansión cited TBY's interview with José Luis Garza, CEO of Interjet, who recently sat down with the TBY team to be included in The Business Year: Mexico 2017, which will be published in the third quarter of 2017. Garza explained that this agreement would benefit Interjet, one of Mexico's main airlines, allowing it to expand and to fly to new destinations in the United States from Mexican cities.</p><p>The agreement will benefit Mexico and the US by increasing the number of commercial flights. Also, there will be a greater influx of passengers and exports.</p><p>The Open Skies agreement will create an economic impact of at least USD650 million in Mexico's tourism sector. Furthermore, it is estimated that 279 national routes and 186 international routes will open.</p><p>Garza mentioned that this agreement would help Interjet expand in the American market, flying to cities such as New York, Los Angeles, and Miami. Nevertheless, there are still limitations to growth in the Central and South American markets due to old restrictive bilateral agreements.</p>]]></body0content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>With steady economic growth and political stability, Costa Rica has positioned itself as one of the most valued and sustainable economies not only in the region, but in the world. The roundtable aimed to showcase the country's emerging opportunities for investment as well as the impact of neighboring markets. </p><p>Opening the discussion, Humberto Pacheco addressed the factors that make Costa Rica competitive. “The reality is that abolition of the army in 1948 was the most important element that allowed Costa Rica to focus on education and social development," he emphasized. Referring to the current business community, he remarked, “It has a strong vision and it's pushing the country on the right path."</p><p>Edward F. Sanchez spoke about why Citibank as well as many other multinationals have begun settling operations in Costa Rica. “We have the highest level of education in the region, one of the largest per capita middle classes, and are in the right time zone for operating businesses in the financial, manufacturing, agricultural industries." </p><p>He also added that despite its many advantages, Costa Rica has areas that could be improved upon, principally the financial deficit, followed by infrastructure. In this regard. “The problem Costa Rica has in terms of infrastructure is the timing," said Alberto Arguedas of AmCham. “Projects take too much time to be finished, which makes them less efficient." Humberto Pacheco closed this discussion by adding: “Public expenditure is the main issue that Costa Rica is currently having. We cannot approve more taxes, but we have to reduce public expenditures, which is being done slower than it should."</p><p>The impact of the US elections on the Costa Rican economy was another topic touched upon during the roundtable. Pacheco assured listeners that if Costa Rica and Central America “take an intelligent and proactive role, the new US government will not rock the boat." In this regard, Sanchez concluded with a positive message by saying that Costa Rica does not rely on remittances to fund the government, so the “effect will be minimal."</p><p>Referring to the sustainable model, Arguedas said that Costa Rica owes its leading position to the vision that the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE) had many years ago for boosting renewable energies. He also said that “high electricity costs are still an issue that we are all trying to solve to make Costa Rica a more competitive market." In this regard Pacheco pointed out that “if Costa Rica would use its oil and gas in a regulated way, we could reduce our electricity bills and invest in more green energies such as geothermic and solar."</p><p>The full text of the roundtable discussion will be published in <em>The Business Year: Costa Rica 2017</em>.</p>]]></body1content>

The Oman Daily Observer, a widely-respected English-language broadsheet and one of the oldest newspapers in the Sultanate, and Muscat Daily, another leading English-language periodical, both featured the event.</p><p></p><p>Entitled "Diversification and the Ninth Five-Year Plan: Oman's Path to Sustainable Development," the panel was opened by HE Dr. Ali bin Masoud Al Sunaidy, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and gathered some of the most influential industry leaders in the country. The minister was interviewed by Paul Loomis, TBY's Regional Director for the GCC, as part of the event, and took the opportunity to highlight the importance of the government's privatization plans to ensure  sustainable economic development in the Sultanate. The minister's comments about the implementation of Tanfeedh, a program that gathers the public and private sectors to discuss reforms were highlighted in the press coverage.</p><p>“We are in a new era. CEOs need to come to the government with ideas, with concepts ready to bring financing and add value to the state. [‚Ä¶] If we do not do these things now, we will be at the mercy of what happens to the oil price," the minister was quoted as saying in the Oman Daily Observer article. </p><p>The TBY event brought together some of the country's leading businesspeople, including Oman's biggest industrial firm, Oman Cables, and one of the country's largest family companies Khimji Group. The Sultanate's mining regulator, the Public Authority for Mining and Oman's Tourism Investment Body Omran were also represented at the meeting.</p>]]></body1content>

The partnership, signed in Astana by Giuliana Caruso, TBY's Country Manager of Kazakhstan, and Ermek Sakishev, Chairman of the Investment Fund, is an extension of an agreement signed last year in which both parties seek to further strengthen their cooperation.</p><p>The Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, a subsidiary of national management company Baiterek Holding, is a government institution tasked with increasing the rate of return on public investments and improving the activities of development institutions in Kazakhstan. TBY and the fund signed their first partnership agreement in 2015 for the release of The Business Year: Kazakhstan 2016.

We hope that next year will see a fruitful collaboration in various fields and it will be rich in the exchange of experiences, knowledge, technology, and innovation. As a development institution, we hope that many foreign investors will learn more about local enterprises via the publication of The Business Year: Kazakhstan 2016."<br>Ms. Caruso noted: “The Business Year is committed to the public sector in all the countries we operate. In Kazakhstan we have a clear mission to help place Kazakhstan on the international map as an investment destination. For this reason, we truly value a partnership with the Investment Fund of Kazakhstan, which will leverage TBY's partnership with the government, and we believe this partnership will serve to achieve our common goal of promoting Kazakhstan."</p><p>The Business Year: Kazakhstan 2017, which will feature around 150 face-to-face interviews with senior executives and government officials across all sectors, will be published in 1Q2017 and will feature the views and insights of key business leaders.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>On Tuesday, October 25, TBY launched its latest annual edition on the Mexican economy with a roundtable organized in collaboration with ProMéxico and the Consejo Ejecutivo de Empresas Globales (CEEG) in ProMéxico's headquarters in Mexico City.</p><p>This event gathered important personalities in Mexican business, including Frederic García, General Director of Airbus Mexico and President of the CEEG; Francisco González Díaz, General Director of ProMéxico; and Eduardo Solís, President of the Mexican Automotive Industry Association, among others. The event was focused around a roundtable dialog about the role of international enterprises on the integration of Mexican SMEs in international value chains, a key topic in the latest Mexico edition of TBY<em></em><em></em>.</p><p>Opening this event, González Díaz stressed the importance of this publication for Mexico at an international level, mentioning that “a top-notch selection of interviewers was done [for this edition] and I am sure this will be of great relevance and will leave an important</p><p>footprint that will show the excellent business panorama of Mexico." Frederic García from CEEG also talked about the importance of this publication for the country, explaining that TBY has a major role “to promote more inclusive growth, productivity and employment."</p><p>Carla Albertí de la Rosa, Regional Director of TBY for Latin America, remarked, “this year has been particularly important for The Business Year in Mexico due to the high global demand for economic information about the country. Our readers, mainly international investors, are more interested than ever in our exclusive interviews and exhaustive analysis of the national economy and the sectors with the greatest potential for growth in Mexico."</p><p>In order to conduct its research, TBY interviews over 200 executive leaders of the public and private sectors, including CEOs, government ministers and heads of state. <em>The Business Year: Mexico 2016</em>, the fifth annual edition of the publication on Mexico, included interviews with such distinguished personalities as President Enrique Peña Nieto; Jaime Ruiz Sacristán, President of the Mexican Stock Exchange; Gabriel López, CEO of Ford Mexico; Francisco Crespo, CEO of Coca-Cola Mexico; Agustín Carstens, Governor of the Bank of Mexico; Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS; and Roberto Slim, CEO of Ostar Hotel Groups, among other high-level executive leaders.</p><p>A few weeks ago, TBY began its research for the next edition, <em>The Business Year: Mexico 2017</em>, which will be released in the third trimester of 2017. The next edition will include more than 200 interviews with high level executives and will focus on the relevance of Mexican multinationals in the Latin American region, the rise of advanced manufacturing and high added value exports, and the automotive sector as one of the pillars of the economy.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY held its panel discussion “Diversification and the Ninth Five-Year Plan: Oman's Path to Sustainable Development" on October 20, bringing together several industry leaders. HE Dr. Ali bin Masoud Al Sunaidy, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, opened the event and was interviewed onstage by TBY's Regional Director for the GCC, Paul Loomis.</p><p>During the interview, the Minister laid out parts of a bold, new vision that will drive the Omani economy through a time of fiscal pressure caused by falling commodity prices. He spoke about a sea change in the way the government conducts business, stressing the need for government-linked firms and ministries to sell assets and bring on private partners to invest in projects, instead of merely relying on government funds and contractors. His comments describe a new era of policy in Oman and come in the midst of a new program called Tanfeedh.<br></p><p>Tanfeedh brings all stakeholders together to solve pressing issues and establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for the government. The program was frequently referenced in the Minister's comments as well as in the panel that followed. It is a program inspired by and produced in consultation with Dato Sri' Idris Jala, who was recently a keynote speaker at TBY's Malaysia Roundtable on innovation in the Malaysian economy. Just days before the event, Sultan Qaboos appointed a minister to ensure the program was properly implemented.</p><p>Minister Al Sunaidy encouraged the private sector to change its strategy. "We are in a new era. CEOs need to come to the government with ideas, with concepts ready to bring financing and add value to the state. Utilities like water treatment and solid waste management can be easily privatized; water desalinization can be easily privatized even if not related to electricity generation; dams can be privatized; and from now on every hospital can be privatized. If we do not do these things now, we will be at the mercy of what happens to the oil price," the Minister said.</p><p>His comments telegraphed an announcement made earlier this week by HE Hamood Sangour Al-Zadjali, the Executive President of the Central Bank of Oman (CBO), that Oman plans to borrow USD10 billion or more from international markets over the next four years. This would represent around 60-70% of the budget, with the remainder being drawn from Oman's State General Reserve Fund. According to comments made by the head of the capital authority this week, the Sultanate also plans to raise upwards of USD5 billion through privatizations of government firms. These fiscal changes come on the tail of the nation's deficit doubling to USD10.5 billion in the first eight months of 2016.</p><p>Governments across the Gulf reacted quickly to the impact of falling oil prices on their revenues. Every state in the GCC has raised fuel prices, and late last month Saudi Arabia cut bonuses and salaries for some public sector employees, which collectively contributed 45% of government spending in 2015. The Kingdom also raised a record USD17.5 billion in its first ever international bond offering, showing the strong international appetite for Gulf debt and paving the way for other GCC nations to follow suit.</p><p>The TBY event brought together some of the most influential businesspeople in the country, such as Oman's biggest industrial firm, Oman Cables; one of the country's largest family groups, Khimji Group; the Sultanate's mining regulator, the Public Authority for Mining; and Oman's Tourism Investment Body, Omran. Together, the representatives discussed some of the intended changes, repeatedly referencing the themes of the ongoing Tanfeedh program and stressing how crucial accountability and clear plans for implementation are to each of their sectors.</p><p>Indeed, the question in the GCC today is not whether international investors can be enticed into buying bonds, nor whether Gulf States can afford to repay them. Rather, what remains to be seen if GCC states can implement reforms that are deep and broad enough to spur citizens and public servants to fundamentally reconsider their relationship to the state's oil revenues. The path has just begun, but 2016's opening rounds of reforms are a positive indication.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY, a leading research firm and publisher of annual economic resources on national economies, has signed an MoU with Umm Al Quwain's first free trade zone (UAQ FTZ). </p><p>Sultan Saeed Sultan Al Ali, Executive Director of Port Customs &amp; Free Zones Corporation, Umm Al Quwain, and TBY's Country Manager for the UAE, Burcu Sapmaz, signed the MoU in the presence of Johnson M. George, General Manager of UAQ FTZ, and Lucia Cavero-Baptista, Country Editor of TBY, on October 20, 2016.

UAQ FTZ will provide support in the production of <em>The Business Year: UAE 2017</em>, which will include a special section dedicated to the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain. </p><p>At the signing, Sultan stressed the importance of such an agreement. “This publication will be a good opportunity for UAQ FTZ to showcase our efforts in attracting businesses to Umm Al Quwain despite being new into the market. We are very glad that TBY chose the free zone as their partner and we are looking forward to move ahead with this partnership." George added: “We are very happy to partner with TBY in the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain. UAQ FTZ is a strategic initiative of the Government of Umm Al Quwain, with a mandate to provide the required infrastructure and incentives for the business community. I firmly believe that our association with TBY will be very fruitful for both organizations and predominantly bring in more investments to the Emirate of Umm Al Quwain."</p><p><em>The Business Year: UAE 2017 </em>will act as a reference point for the global investor community and a vehicle to display the key economic drivers and competitive strengths of the country. In order to compile a complete representation of the ever-growing and diversifying economy of the UAE, TBY will work very closely with their partners—the UAE Ministry of Economy, with the advice and direction of the Executive Council. </p><p>UAQ FTZ is designed for SMEs and conglomerates looking to establish their manufacturing units in a safe and secure free trade zone environment and is one of the most attractive places for effective investment in the region.</p>]]></body1content>

Our collaborative efforts with the TBY team will assist us in further demonstrating our extensive research and market analysis on the local economy. Our research team will contribute and highlight key aspects of the economy, specifically focusing on the banking sector and the overall capital market. We look forward to working more closely with TBY in the future with informative projects that not only benefit the private sector, but the Kuwaiti economy as a whole.”</p><p>At the same time, TBY Regional Director Paul Loomis highlighted KAMCO's pioneering investment research: “KAMCO is not only one of the most established investment firms in the country, but its research division has highlighted key trends in the Kuwaiti and regional economies. It aligns with TBY's mission to provide well-rounded insight into the country's investment climate through objective analysis. We are proud to partner with KAMCO and to present the fruits of our collaboration in our upcoming second edition on the Kuwaiti economy.”</p><p>TBY will conduct interviews with more than 150 business and political leaders to discuss major developments in the key segments of the Kuwaiti economy, including infrastructure and construction, retail and real estate, finance, energy, ICT, agriculture, transport, health and education, industry, and tourism. While the publication is primarily comprised of interviews, <em>The Business Year: Kuwait 2017</em> will additionally feature focus articles, highlighting specific developments, major projects, and challenges in each sector.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><span></span>A recent innovation forum organized by The Business Year and Make It Right—an NGO powered by Brickfields Asia College—received wide attention in the local media. Most attention went to the keynote address by Dato' Sri Idris Jala, CEO of the Performance Management and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU), who is responsible for the nation's transformation agenda to become a high-income state by 2020.</p><p>During his speech, he displayed statistics that indicated Malaysia has truly closed the middle-income gap and that it was well on its way to becoming a high-income nation, a large part because the balance in public versus private investments had shifted from 60-40 to 40-60 in the last five years.</p><p>Raja Singham, Managing Director of Brickfields Asia and the founder of Make It Right, strongly emphasized the role of education in empowering people and as a driver for inclusive sustainable growth. Singham is well respected for his initiatives to broaden access to education, for example with EduNation, a free online study platform.</p><p><em>The Sun</em> daily focused on the panel discussion on innovation and quoted Datuk Phang Ah Tong's call on Malaysian firms to strengthen product technology and stay competitive, stating competition is not just regional but global. Wan Latiff Wan Musa, meanwhile, emphasized on the role of SMEs to drive innovation</p><p>The event was reported by the largest English-language papers as well as a number of Malaysian ones. Weekly magazine <em>The Edge</em> did a full-page background analysis of the claims made by Dato' Sri Idris Jala that Malaysia was out of the middle-income trap.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY held a forum on innovation in partnership with the Make It Right Movement—an NGO powered by Brickfields Asia College. The keynote address was delivered by Dato' Sri Idris Jala, CEO of the Performance Management and Delivery Unit (PEMANDU) and former Minister in the Prime Minister's Department, CEO of Malaysia Airlines, and country head of Shell Malaysia.</p><p>The topic was “Innovation as a Driver for Local Economic Empowerment." Jala strongly emphasized that innovative techniques for governance were commonly used within the public sector, and that innovation was among the government's top priorities. PEMANDU has organized laboratories to bring the private sector into direct dialogue with government officials on how to solve concrete issues including transport and power generation and distribution. </p><p>Mr. Raja Singham, Founder of the Make It Right Movement, outlined the challenges facing educators across the country and elaborated his perspective on inclusive growth and improving access to education. He also emphasized legal and regulatory issues that the education sector faces and joined Jala in critiquing the status quo and suggesting alternative directions forwards.</p><p>The starting point for the roundtable discussion was the balance between public and private investment in Malaysia, and the role of innovation as a driver of global competiveness. Having a confident private sector that is responsible for the majority of investment is one of the preconditions of becoming a high-income economy, Jala pointed out, but an innovative economy is composed of public and private sectors working together. To reflect the complexity of Malaysia's economy, the panel included a wide range of actors, both state led and private.</p><p>From the public sector, the roundtable included Datuk Phang Ah Tong, Deputy CEO of MIDA, and<br>Mr. Wan Latiff Wan Musa, Head of Strategic Planning Division at MATRADE. Mr. Mohamed Azli, COO of GE Malaysia, gave the perspective of a multinational with vast experience in Malaysia in a variety of sectors, while  Datuk Ir. Khairil Anwar Ahmad, Managing Director of Medini Iskandar, and Tan Sri Dato' Seri Ahmad Ramli Mohd Noor, Managing Director, Boustead Heavy Engineering Corporation were present in the panel as Malaysian private companies with strong governmental backing.</p><p>Datuk Phang set the stage by pointing out innovation is pivotal for Malaysia to stay ahead of regional competitors—especially with Vietnam—and emphasized education and human capital development as key drivers of innovation. </p><p>Datuk Khairil outlined the growth of Medini Iskandar, a township that is currently under development in the south of Peninsular Malaysia and is being constructed as a Smart City. Building this concept as a green field project means innovation by default, he explained, and that the township's proximity to Singapore would create a two-way exchange of people and ideas between the nations. </p><p>Tan Sri Ramli mentioned that BHIC committed to the objective of training 1,000 maritime engineers in the upcoming years to bridge academia and industry and to support the nations' manufacturing economy. Likewise Mr. Wan Latiff expressed that the ecosystem for young entrepreneurs could be enhanced to drive the innovation agenda and to support SMEs to go abroad.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>In cooperation with the German-Iranian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry (AHK Iran), The Business Year held a roundtable discussion under the title “Roadmap to Reconnection: Iran-Europe cooperation after the JCPOA." The event took part in Tehran and featured Dr. Mohsen Nayebzadeh, CEO of Siemens SSK; Andreas Schmidt, General Manager of Robert Bosch Iran; Catalin Sfrija, President of Henkel Iran; Farzad Amanpour, Senior Advisor to the Board of Directors of Saman Bank; and Arash Onsori, Director of International Affairs Department of the Bank of Industry &amp; Mine. The debate was moderated by Cristiana Di Filippo, Country Manager of The Business Year in Iran with substantive input from Rene Harun, Managing Director of AHK Iran.</p><p>After years of economic isolation in Iran, the event reflected the current high level of global interest in the country following the lifting of sanctions, especially for European companies and investors. By gathering leading representatives from both Iranian and European firms, the roundtable aimed to shed light on the practical aspects of doing business in a post-sanction environment, and particularly the role of the financial system in fostering linkages between both economies. In this new era for the Islamic Republic, all the participants augured a bright outlook for the coming years, but agreed that the reconnection to the global economy will take time and effort from both sides.</p><p>The pending issue of trade financing between Europe and Iran emerged as a dominant topic of discussion. While many of Europe's largest financial institutions remain hesitant to do business with Iran, some of the country's most prominent banks like Saman Bank and the Bank of Industry &amp; Mine have drawn up a plan to facilitate the cooperation between economies. Mr. Amanpour and Mr. Onsori stated their readiness to support European manufacturers and clarified their compliance with international financial standards.</p><p>An example of this fruitful cooperation was depicted by Mr. Sfrija, Mr. Schmidt, and Dr. Nayebzadeh. The representatives of Henkel, Bosch, and Siemens, respectively, three German companies with a long tradition in Iran, gave their advice on how to do business in the country and welcomed new foreign firms to the market.</p><p>The full text of the roundtable discussion will be published in <em>The Business Year: Iran 2016</em>. Both The Business Year and the German-Iranian Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry expressed their gratitude to the participants and their satisfaction for the result of the discussion.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p></p><p>TBY recently held a roundtable discussion in cooperation with the British Malaysian Chamber of Commerce, with the participation of Mahendra Gursahani, CEO of Standard Chartered Malaysia, Muhamad Hanif Hashim, General Manager of Petrofac Malaysia, and John Stocker, Director Malaysia of BAE Systems. Topics for the discussion on the role innovation in their growth strategies and how multinationals can add value to the local economy with offset packages, global service centers and graduate programs.</p><p>Malaysia is an important market for Standard Chartered, as it employs, besides its banking operations, nearly 5,000 people in a global services center called Scope. The center services more than 40 countries 24/7, in their respective languages. Gursahani elaborated on recent investments undertaken by Standard Chartered to make this into an improved facility called the “Collective Intelligence and Command Centre," a concept that integrates global fintech solutions into its services. This week the bank, which has been present on Malaysian soil since 1875, launched video banking to personalize online banking solutions.</p><p>BAE Systems is currently bidding to supply the Malaysian state with modern multirole fighter aircraft. On adding value to the local economy, Stocker mentioned the offset packages that the Eurofighter Typhoon would bring to the country. Malaysia's already well-developed aerospace ecosystem could be further enhanced by BAE Systems' MRO, local supply, and training programs.</p><p>Furthermore, BAE Systems runs a major global cyber security operations center from Malaysia, which, similarly to Standard Chartered's fintech efforts, has found success due to a skilled workforce and cost-effective operations uniquely available in this market. BAE Systems also has a joint venture with Boustead Heavy Industries, a Malaysian shipbuilder and defense firm, on the supply, MRO, and training for naval weapon systems, and expressed its strong commitment to further expand similar partnerships in the region.</p><p>Hanif, GM of Petrofac, a leading services provider in the oil and gas industry, mentioned innovation as one of its core pillars. Petrofac is one of the engineering service providers to PETRONAS, and has brought expertise and training in a broad range of activities. The nature of the energy industry's demand for services has shifted with higher oil price volatility, and Petrofac has turned its attention of cost saving measures across extraction and production.</p><p>When it comes to adding value to the local economy, the company's long presence in the country has led to a large pool of engineers and Hanif Hashim mentioned that he is proof of Petrofac acknowledging the skill of local Malaysians in managing its business units. In his opinion, strong cooperation between native universities and multinationals—in the form of traineeships and a dialogue on curricula—can spur economic development.</p><p>All three companies have a long and established presence in Malaysia, and are committed to keep investing. The full text of the roundtable discussion will be published in The Business Year: Malaysia, to be launched in January 2017. The Business Year expresses its gratitude to the British Chamber of Commerce, which co-organized this event.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY, a leading research firm and publisher of annual economic resources on national economies, and the American-Lebanese Chamber of Commerce (AmCham), organized a roundtable entitled: “Startup ecosystem sustainability: fostering cooperation to drive entrepreneurship." The roundtable was held on June 21 at AmCham offices in Beirut Central District and assembled leaders within the entrepreneurship ecosystem to discuss the opportunities and challenges of Lebanon's burgeoning knowledge economy.  </p><p>Participants included Henri Asseily, Managing Partner of Leap Ventures; Maroun Chammas, Chairman of Berytech; Nadim Kassar, General Manager of Fransabank; Salim Zeenni, Chairman of AmCham; Samer Karam, General Manager of Startup Megaphone; Tamara Zakharia, General Manager of Startup Ecosystem Think Tank (SETT); Fadi Saab, Chairman of AmCham's Better Business Group and of TCF Group; Elie Akhras, Program Manager at the UK Lebanon Tech Hub; and Frederic Dib representing MIT Enterprise Forum Arab Startup. The roundtable was moderated by Leland Rice, Editor-in-Chief of TBY.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Rice noted that Banque du Liban's Circular 331 had spurred an unparalleled amount of funding to invest in Lebanon's knowledge economy, built upon the country's creative talents and highly-qualified human capital.</p><p>Setting the tone for a fruitful discussion, Henri Asseily noted that Leap Ventures had allocated $71 million dollars to be deployed in numerous startups, referring to the ecosystem as “an opportunity to revert Lebanon's brain-drain by raising salaries for youngsters and exposing the potential of local talent." In line with Asseily's remarks, Berytech's Maroun Chammas expressed his confidence in the sector by noting that “in only one year and a half the ecosystem has grown tremendously and the quality of our startups has improved substantially."</p><p>Representing the banking sector—and major engine of start up capital in Lebanon—Nadim Kassar said Circular 331 was “an eye-opener for the banking industry to raise their interest in the ecosystem." He also recalled that 331 “helped to minimize the risks for the banking sector to invest in entrepreneurial projects, thus stimulating competition within the ecosystem."</p><p>Adding to the discussion, Salim Zeenni pointed out the “challenging environment startups face in terms of the availability of technology" and expressed his positive views on how “the Lebanese industrial sector is working to overcome this challenge and make things even for those startups coming out to the global market". </p><p>The Business Year is currently working on its fifth edition on the Lebanese economy, which will feature a special focus on the current momentum of the startup ecosystem as well as the players involved in the development of this industry.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>The Business Year (TBY), in partnership with the Presidency of Azerbaijan, launched <em>The Business Year: Azerbaijan 2016</em>, its six annual edition on the country, on May 25, 2016, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Baku.</p><p>Prior to the event, TBY's Editor-in-Chief Leland Rice and Managing Director for Middle East Betul Çakaloğlu met with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev to brief him on the major findings of this year's edition and present him with the TBY “Man of the Year" award in recognition of his leadership in transnational energy projects, major international events in the country over the last year, the development of Azerbaijan as a transport corridor, and the promotion dialogues between cultures.</p><p>“This edition is important for promoting Azerbaijan in the world, and we look forward to continuing the relationship with TBY," Presdient Aliyev said in the meeting. Regarding the Man of the Year honors, he added: “I'm grateful for this recognition. The reasons you noted for giving this award reflect very well this government's number one priorities."</p><p>The launch event that evening featured a keynote address by Dr. Prof. Ali Hassanov, Aide to the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Public and Political Affairs, Head of Department for Public and Political Affairs, 1st Grade State Councilor. “I would like to thank TBY for its careful consideration of this award and for its accurate coverage of the country," Dr. Hassanov told the crowd of nearly 100 business leaders, cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, dignitaries, and journalists. “Politicians are responsible for making history, but it is the media that passes this on to the world. For this we thank TBY for its quality work, both here in Azerbaijan and around the world."</p><p>The event included additional speeches by the Minister of Culture and Tourism Abulfas Garayev, Mayor of Ganja Elmar Rustam oglu Valiyev, Azercell CEO Vahid Mursliyev, and Leland Rice, who presented highlights from the edition. The event concluded with performances from some of Azerbaijan's most renowned musicians.</p><p>The publication itself features interviews with Azerbaijan's leading figures. It opens with a forward from President Ilham Aliyev, followed by interviews with Austrian President Heinz Fischer, Latvian President Raimonds Vejonis, and Bosnia and Herzegovina President Bakir Izetbegovic, speaking about bilateral relations between their countries and Azerbaijan.</p><p>Other noteworthy interviews include: Elmar Mammadyarov, Minister of Foreign Affairs; Col-Gen Kamaladdin Heydarov, Minister of Emergency Situations; Mir Jamal Pashayev, Director of PASHA Holding; Rovnag Abdullayev, President of SOCAR, and Bernie Ecclestone, Chief Executive of Formula One Group. In total there are 168 interviews.</p><p>At the event, TBY also released the results of its inaugural Business Confidence Index (BCI) for Azerbaijan. The index, based on a collation of data from all of its 2016 interviews, offers a comparative look at the sentiments of leading executives in different sectors. Agriculture ranked highest on the Confidence Index, followed by Tourism and IT &amp; Telecoms.</p><p>“One major theme of our coverage this year, and a variable that impacted the BCI, was multiculturalism," said Rice. “It was “The Year of Multiculturalism," so we looked at Azerbaijan's role in promoting dialogues between cultures, particularly through major international events in 2016. But what we also found was that these values had an economic impact, as a number of executives cited Azerbaijan's peace and stability, as well as diverse and far-reaching bilateral relations, as reasons for their confidence. This was especially true in energy and tourism."</p><p>Çakaloğlu noted the support TBY has received for its work in Azerbaijan. “Across the last six years, the partnership and collaboration we've enjoyed with both the government and the business community here has been invaluable in our mission to produce the predominant international publication on Azerbaijan's economy."</p><p><em>The Business Year: Azerbaijan 2016</em> will reach a global audience of 97,700 readers via its printed version, while a wider audience will be able to access it through TBY's iPad, iPhone, and Android applications.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>TBY held a press launch event for its third edition on Oman's economy, The Business Year: Oman 2016, on April 13, 2016, in the Zaiba Ballroom at the Hormuz Grand Hotel in Muscat.  </p><p>This edition, which was produced in partnership with Oman's Public Authority for Investment Promotion &amp; Export Development (Ithraa), features interviews with Oman's most important policy makers and business leaders. The edition opens with an inside perspective from His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and is followed by an interview with Lilianne Ploumen, the Minister of Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, who speaks about trade and business ties between the two countries. The Business Year Oman: 2016 goes on to feature around 150 interviews with top executives and government officials.</p><p>The keynote speaker at the event was Mr. Taleb al Makhmari, the Director General of Marketing and Media at Ithraa. Commenting on this project and the economic strides made by Oman over the past year, he said, ““The Business Year is an important guide and leading source of business intelligence on Oman. It offers readers a detailed analysis of the economy and the projects driving the Sultanate's ambitious development plans," said Taleb Al Makhmari, Ithraa's Director General of Marketing &amp; Media.”</p><p>The publication focuses on key issues surrounding Oman's economic development. The diversification measures taken by Oman have resulted in the non-hydrocarbon sector accounting for over one-third of the total GDP. From its innovative special economic zone at Duqm to continuing its Omanization practices designed to spur inward growth and foster domestic stability, Oman is constantly looking to improve its position in the GCC and the international arena. As an internationally recognized peacekeeper in the region, Oman also enjoys an ever-increasing tourism sector, which is one of the fastest growing industries in the country.</p><p>Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of The Business Year, remarked: “We are excited to launch our third publication on the economy of Oman. We continuously work to maintain an innovative and exciting publication for the country, especially as Oman takes further steps aimed at diversification and internal growth. Working with Ithraa as our partner only added to the success of our project and our relationship with them is bolstered through our mutual interest of stimulating and attracting investments in Oman. “</p><p>In addition to featuring various Ministers of Oman including the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Minister of Environment and Climate Affairs, and the Minister of Transport and Communications, among many others, some of the important figures presented in this edition include: Dr.Khalifa Abdullah Al Barwani, CEO of the National Center for Statistics and Information; Khalifa Said Salim Al Abri, CEO of Riyada, Public Authority for SME Development; Gong Changli, CEO of Daleel Petroleum; David Gledhill, CEO of the Port of Salalah; HE Hamood Sangour Al-Zadjali, Executive President of the Central Bank of Oman; Lloyd Maddock, CEO of Ahli Bank; Abdul Samad Mohd Al Maskari, CEO of Al Madina Investment; and many others.</p><p>Betül Çakaloğlu, Regional Director of The Business Year, offered her words on the release of The Business Year: Oman 2016 and the importance of working with their partner, saying, “Ithraa's guidance and expertise has been central to the development of this platform for investors and business people worldwide, and we hope to maintain this collaboration as we continue to highlight Oman's investment potential to an international audience.”</p><p>The Business Year: Oman 2016 will reach a global audience of 97,700 readers in its print version, while a wider audience will be able to access it through TBY's website and iPad, iPhone, and Android applications. The interviews are structured around the main sectors of the economy, including finance, energy, mining and industry, environment and utilities, ICT, transport and logistics, the DUQM special economic zone, construction and real estate, agriculture and fisheries, health, education, and tourism. Also featured in the publication are sector-oriented focus articles, offering important facts and figures about interesting projects, investments, and opportunities available in Oman.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>Saudi Arabia, March 28, 2016—The Council of Saudi Chambers (CSC), in collaboration with leading international research firm The Business Year (TBY), organized a roundtable titled “Strategic Transformation to boost economic growth" in a bid to enhance awareness of the opportunities available to businesspeople in Saudi Arabia, while informing the global investment community of current economic realities in the Arab Kingdom.</p><p>The roundtable took place on Monday, March 28, in at the CSC's Riyadh headquarter and focused on the role that both the government and the private sector are playing to reshape and revitalize the Saudi economy.  </p><p>The speakers were critical representatives of major Saudi institutions: Abdulrahman Al Zamil, Chairman of CSC; Dr. Faisal Alsugair, Chairman of Saudi Civil Aviation Holding Company (SCAHC); Mohammed Al Hussein, Secretary General of Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI); and Tawfiq Al Ohali, acting CEO of National Unified Procurement Company for Medical Supplies (NUPCO). The moderator was Mr. Leland Rice, Editor-in-Chief of The Business Year. </p><p>The participants spoke about privatization and other aspects of the national transformation plan, and how there reforms impact their respective sectors and companies. </p><p>Opening the discussion, Mr. Al Zamil said, “The old way of doing business doesn't work anymore," and he spoke about how the drop in oil price is bringing “golden opportunities" for the country as the Government and private companies are now induced to adopt best practices and increase efficiency.</p><p>Referring to the plunge of the commodity's price, Dr. Faisal Alsugair assured that this “short-term crisis is prompting a long-term improvement" and explained how the ongoing privatization process will bring more efficiency for all airports' users. </p><p>Mohammed Al Hussein stated that “privatization is very attractive in health sector." Mr. Tawfiq Al Ohali pointed out that “no matter how much the Government spends, demand is always higher for medical and pharmaceutical supplies" and said that NUPCO will handle the whole pharma chain, increasing efficiency and decreasing cost for the Government. </p><p>The Business Year is currently conducting a research in the Kingdom for the third edition of The Business Year: Saudi Arabia, which will provide readers with in-depth analysis on the major sectors of the economy through up-to-date facts and figures—at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels—explaining how the country survives and thrives despite a low oil price crisis. The Council of Saudi Chambers is a strategic partner of the international business and research firm.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;">The Business Year (TBY) launched its second edition on Nigeria's economy, </span><em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2016,</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: initial;"> on January 21, 2016, at the </span>Steigenberger Grandhotel Belvédère on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p><p><span></span>The edition, which was produced in formal partnership with the Presidency of Nigeria, features interviews with Nigeria's most important policy makers and business leaders.  The edition opens with an interview with Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria, followed by interviews with South African President Jacob Zuma and Belgium Prime Minister Charles Michel, all commenting on bilateral relations with Nigeria.</p><p><span></span>Important figures interviewed include Aliko Dangote, Chairman of Dangote Group; Jim Ovia, Chairman of Zenith Bank; Femi Otedola, Chairman of Forte Oil; Tony Elumelu, Chairman of Heirs Holding; Wale Tinubu, Group Chief Executive of Oando; and many others. In each sector of the economy interviews with key stakeholders, regulators, and government officials indicate the direction of a nation at a crucial juncture in its history.</p><p><span></span>At the event, TBY also released the results of their Business Confidence Index for Nigeria. The index, based on a collation of data from over 200 interviews, offers a comparative look at the sentiments of leading executives in different sectors. On a confidence scale of 1 to 5, IT &amp; telecoms ranked the highest, followed by agriculture. Executives cited their optimism in President Buhari's anti-corruption efforts and reforms aimed at diversification. Energy ranked the lowest, with low global oil prices being the most commonly referenced factor. </p><p><span></span>Speaking at the event, Oscar Oyenma, CEO of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), also noted that efforts to strengthen corporate governance and transparency were bringing a note of optimism to his 2016 outlook for Nigeria's capital markets. “Diverse investment products, strong regulation, increased transparency, and easy access to the market have ensured increased participation." </p><p><span></span>Ayse Valentin, CEO of The Business Year, said: “We are excited to launch our second publication on Nigeria's economy. We are fortunate to have had the full support of the Presidency of Nigeria, who facilitated the best possible production of our annual economic overview."</p><p><span></span>Leland Rice, Editor-in-Chief of The Business Year, spoke on the major events that shaped this year's coverage. “Nigeria's free, fair, and peaceful elections were a high-water mark for 2015, not just for Nigeria but for the continent and the world," Rice said. “The subsequent instillation of a reformist administration has created hopefulness for the future and fueled unprecedented demand among global investors for insights on Nigeria's trajectory in 2016."</p><p><span></span>The nation's major development projects are extensively covered, including Eko Atlantic and Centenary City. The Finance chapter, one of the key pieces of the publication, features interviews with Godwin Emefiele, the Governor of the Central Bank, as well as with the heads of the country's leading banks and financial institutions. Other chapters are similarly complete and describe in detail the workings of each sector of Nigeria's economy through interviews with the people moving them forwards.</p><p><span></span><em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2016</em> will reach a global audience of 97,700 readers via its printed version, while a wider audience will be able to access it through TBY's iPad, iPhone, and Android applications.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>The Business Year, in partnership with the Sharjah Economic Development Department (SEDD), launched its first edition on Sharjah's economy, The Business Year: Sharjah 2015, on November 18th, 2015, at the Sharjah Economic Development Department headquarters in Sharjah, UAE.</p><p><span></span>The publication covers around 100 interviews with top executives and government officials. Some examples include His Highness Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Sultan Al Qasimi, Crown Prince and Deputy Ruler of Sharjah; HE Sheikha Bodour bint Sultan Al Qasimi, Chairperson of Shurooq; HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Saud Sultan Al Qasimi, Chairman of the Sharjah Finance Department; and HE Hana Saif Al Suwaidi, Chairperson of the Sharjah Environment and Protected Areas Authority.</p><p><span></span>The Guest of Honor at the event, His Excellency Sultan Abdullah bin Hadda Al Suwaidi, Chairman of the Sharjah Economic Development Department, said, “Such an achievement and work is a one that represents, clearly, the cooperation between the public and private sectors, especially the government entities which responded immediately to our request to provide all the needed information for The Business Year. It is worth mentioning that Sharjah has a long tradition of strong economic potential; it is known to have the first and the oldest ports in the Gulf region, the first airport, the oldest schools, roads, and energy stations, as well as the largest and oldest industrial area in the Gulf, dating back to the 1970s.”</p><p><span></span>Ay≈üe Valentin, CEO of The Business Year, said: “We are excited to launch our inaugural publication on Sharjah's economy. It is our privilege to report on the Emirate, at a time when the economic strengths are being fine-tuned, coupled with increased diversification. We are fortunate to have had the full support of the Sharjah Economic Development Department, who have facilitated the best possible production of our annual economic overview.”</p><p><span></span>The event featured a panel discussion featuring: Mr. Ahmed Saif Binsaed Al Suwaidi, Deputy Head of Public Relations Section, Sharjah Economic Development Department; Mr. Saud Salim Al Mazrouei, Director of the Hamriyah Free Zone Authority &amp; Sharjah Airport International Free Zone Authority (SAIF); and Mr. Jassem Al Baloushi, Head of Organizational Excellence, Sharjah Islamic Bank. Mr. Leland Rice, Managing Editor of The Business Year, moderated the discussion. Talking points of the Round Table included the strengths and challenges of Sharjah's increasingly diversified economy, how Sharjah has leveraged its geography to become the region's manufacturing hub, and the outlook for Sharjah's medium-term economic future.</p><p><span></span>The publication focuses on key issues surrounding Sharjah's economic development. Sharjah has become an important part of the UAE, carving out a niche for itself in a number of areas. From its competitive free zones and industrial matrix to buzzing tourism scene and green idealism, the Emirate is increasingly finding itself on the lips of executives across the world as a valid investment destination in the region.</p><p><span></span>Betül Çakaloğlu, Regional Director of The Business Year, spoke of the importance of The Business Year's research in Sharjah: “After the success of the first edition of The Business Year: Sharjah, TBY is eager to continue in partnership with the Sharjah Economic Development Department. The Department's guidance and expertise has been crucial to the development of this platform for investors and businessmen worldwide, and we hope to maintain this collaboration as we continue to highlight Sharjah's growing potential to an international audience.”</p><p><span></span>The Business Year: Sharjah 2015 will reach a global audience of 97,700 readers via its printed version, while a wider audience will be able to access it through TBY's iPad, iPhone, and Android applications. The interviews are structured around chapters covering the main sectors of the economy, including finance, energy and industry, telecoms and IT, transport and logistics, maritime, construction and real estate, health, education, and tourism. TBY's research articles provide the reader with vital facts and figures—at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels—highlighting specific projects, investments, and opportunities.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong><strong>Kuwait, October 28, 2015</strong>—TBY is currently preparing its first annual publication focused on Kuwait.</p><p>In preparation for the publication, TBY recently sat down with HE Nayaf Falah Mubarak Al Hajraf, Chairman of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA), to discuss the authority's main goals as it works to raise the level of operation at the Kuwaiti Stock Exchange, one of the oldest in the Gulf, to international standards.</p><p>During the interview, the Chairman explained the achievements of the authority thus far, amending 65 of 164 articles in the national assembly law, moving closer to achieving their target of officially joining the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).</p><p>To ensure the Kuwaiti market is upgraded from frontier to emerging market status, the Chairman emphasized the importance of working with each of the three main entities of the market: the Kuwait Clearing Company, the newly established Kuwait Bourse Company, and the brokerage firms, stating that “The CMA is leading the effort to restructure the capital markets but everyone's participation is needed."</p><p>Promoting the Kuwaiti capital market to international investors has been a key driving force behind the CMA's new policies. A significant step forward in this has been the market's successful privatization, which has now set the stage for foreign international operators to own a stake of the Kuwaiti stock exchange of up to 44%. The Chairman expressed that, “by offering up to 44%, we hope international operators will have the incentive to run companies here long term." And that, “the new amendment has exempted foreign investors from any taxes; dividends will have no tax nor will there be a capital gains tax."<br>The Chairman also expressed his desire to “begin dialogues with international organizations to form strategic partnerships in terms of training and capacity building for the CMA."</p><p>Given the strong competition from neighboring regional stock exchanges, addressing operational issues such as the loss in Kuwaiti market liquidity of upward of 80% over the past decade and the relative lack of investor confidence in the Kuwait stock exchange (KSE) will allow for Kuwait's transition to emerging market status to occur steadily and over time, and competitiveness is expected to grow in tandem.</p><p>Speaking on the role of the Boursa Kuwait Securities Company will play in the Kuwait stock market's transformation, Khaled Abdulrazzaq Al Khaled, Chairman of the Board &amp; CEO, explained to TBY that, “Our current goal is to assume administrative control of the KSE and to begin a 46-step strategic transformation plan that we have devised with input from all stakeholders to improve the exchange's current performance, turning it into a leading, regional market. It is important to note here that law 7/2010 also outlined the ownership structure of the exchange, dictating the sale of 50% of the exchange to Kuwaiti citizens in an IPO, a percentage not less than 6% and not more than 24% to be allocated to government bodies and a percentage not more than 44% and not less than 26% to be auctioned to an international operator."</p><p>Echoing the sentiments of both the CMA and the Kuwait Boursa Securities Co., Othman I. Al-Issa, CEO of the Kuwait Clearing Company (KCC), told TBY: “We want to adopt international best practices, and we have invested heavily in our IT infrastructure. The board just approved a five-year strategy whereby we are utilizing a consultancy firm to conduct a gap analysis to see how we fall in terms of position. We hope to bring KCC up to par with international standards, which will promote Kuwait's upgrade to emerging market status."</p><p>In light of the fact that the public sector in Kuwait is known to be the most dominant, employing almost 80% of the total Kuwaiti workforce and accounting for 70% of GDP, these shifts in regulation and ownership structure of Kuwait's capital market indicate that the country is on a path of economic diversification, and seeks to position itself as a financial hub in the years ahead.<br>The complete interviews with HE Nayaf Falah Mubarak Al Hajraf, the CEO of the Kuwait Clearing Company, and the Chairman and CEO of the Kuwait Bourse Company, will be featured in The Business Year: Kuwait 2016.</p><p>With first-hand, exclusive interviews, The Business Year: Kuwait 2016 will be a comprehensive case study of the Kuwaiti economy and an invaluable tool for investors seeking opportunities in the region. TBY's interviewees, readers, and partners comprise an international network of thought-leaders helping to define the future of the global economy. In addition to widely circulated digital versions available on iPad, iPhone, and Android applications, physical copies of the edition will reach over 97,700 subscribers worldwide.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>With Dubai's ambition to become the capital of the Islamic economy, events like the Global Islamic Economy Summit (GIES) are a vital platform to exchange ideas on how the Emirate can benefit from these opportunities and build a cohesive Islamic economy while connecting the world's leading thinkers and stakeholders to inspire projects and drive future investments.<br></p><p>The summit, hosted by Dubai Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, the Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre (DIEDC), and Thompson Reuters, was held on October 5th-6th at Madinat Jumeirah. Over 2,000 delegates from around the world gathered in Dubai for the two-day summit, at which critical issues affecting the Islamic economy were discussed, including investment and business opportunities in Islamic insurance and finance, the halal food value chain, product manufacturing, and tourism and SMEs.</p><p>Speaking of the event, HE Majid Saif Al Ghurair, Chairman of Dubai Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, said, "With 57 speakers, 16 panel discussions, and 4,000 participants from around the world, the Summit highlights the potential of Dubai in the Islamic economy area, while emphasising its commitment to making the Emirate a global capital of the Islamic economy."<br>Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai, announced, in 2013, Dubai as “Capital of the Islamic Economy." The Islamic Economy has a potential worth of $2 trillion worldwide, with not only 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide but also plausible non-Muslim consumers that are looking for a more ethical system of finance and one which considers the impact of its activities on society.</p><p>Dubai has become the world's leading hub for the multi-billion dollar trade in Islamic bonds, known as sukuk. Promoting new Islamic financial products will enhance not only Dubai's sukuk business but also that of other Islamic economies.</p><p>Many people around the world are beginning to find the principles of Islamic banking more attractive than those of conventional financial services. There has been a surge of interest in Islamic finance from non-Muslim countries such as the UK, Luxembourg, South Africa, and Hong Kong. Emirates Islamic, during the Summit, announced the launch of the ISLAMIC BANKING INDEX, the first-of-its-kind consumer focused survey on Islamic banking in the UAE. The new index will provide an annual benchmark of shifts in the penetration, perception, knowledge, and intention of UAE consumers when it comes to sharia-compliant banking. Islamic banking in the UAE has a penetration score of 47%; that is, the UAE's banking consumers have at least one Islamic banking product. This shows an evident opportunity for Islamic banking penetration since between 65% and 80% of non-Muslim consumers hold conventional products and less than one-third of Islamic products across all categories.</p><p>The results of the index show optimistic results with 75% of all intenders being open to Islamic banking products, of which 86% were Muslim and 59% non-Muslim. However, there is still a perception among respondents, especially non-Muslim users, that conventional banks are better in technology, innovation, and financial soundness.</p><p>Despite this, incredible innovations that could drive Islamic economies were discussed at the Summit. The last two years have seen: the launch of wearable technology for Hajj and Umrah; Fariqak.com, the first online fantasy football game based on the European Leagues to be designed for MENA fans; Crowd Analyzer, the world's first Arabic-focused social media monitoring platform; and MasterCard's Halal Benefits Program.</p><p>Even though every sector of the Islamic economy has grown at an extraordinary pace, its full potential is yet to be unfolded. The $2.1 trillion Halal food industry represents a tremendous opportunity for growth on both a domestic and international level for Dubai. Both government authorities as well as industry players have mobilized in order to standardize the halal certification process, creating facilities to attract halal industry investors and establishing an awareness campaign to integrate the label with the private sector. The GIES also touched upon Islamic Art &amp; Design, which have been identified as integral components of the Islamic economy.</p><p>The event also hosted a series of awards presented by HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in order to recognize initiatives and ideas that have served to enhance bilateral trade and investment relations between Islamic nations. The winners of the awards were: Dubai International Financial Centre for Money &amp; Finance; Chemical Company of Malaysia Berhad for Food &amp; Health; Unity Productions Foundation for Media; Hajjnet for Hospitality &amp; Tourism; Center for Zakat Management for Waqf &amp; Endowments; Affinis Labs for SME Development; Amanie Advisors LLC for Islamic Economy Knowledge Infrastructure; and Gould for Islamic Arts. Additionally, the Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Iqbal Khan, founder and CEO of Fajr Capital, for outstanding contributions to the Islamic economy.</p><p>The Business Year, a leading research firm and publisher of annual economic resources on national economies, attended the event as a media partner to further explore the investment appetite in the sectors that represent the broader Islamic economy. The recently released 'The Business Year: Dubai 2015 discussed topics such as the takaful insurance market and the halal industry. The Business Year: Dubai 2016, which is currently underway, will be published next year with a focus on Islamic loans.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>With Egypt today facing an increasing energy demand, events like The Future of Energy in Egypt (event website: futureofenergyegypt.com; corporate website: futurenrgcorp.com) are a vital part of the ongoing national dialogue. The conference, hosted by Future Energy Corporation, will be held from August 31st to September 1st, 2015, and aims to bring together industry leaders to discuss the issues and opportunities in Egypt, specifically as to how to revolutionize Egypt's infrastructure and framework that will make it a leader in both energy exports as well as thought leadership.</p><p>“As Egypt starts to open up its power sector for private investment, it puts Future Energy Corporation in a unique position to combine its global experience along with its deep local roots to help shape the energy agenda and bring together industry leaders from around the world to discuss the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead," Future Energy Corporation's Ramy Khorshed explained. “We look forward to discussing and formulating an energy mix for Egypt that capitalizes on the country's vast renewable and fossil fuel resources while achieving energy independence."</p><p>Future Energy Corporation is a leading power developer, specializing in advanced energy solutions and renewable energy infrastructure. With subsidiaries worldwide, the company is able to complete large-scale projects that lower energy costs while ensuring reliable and safe power delivery via state-of-the-art infrastructure. The conference comes at a convenient time, as Egypt has experienced a several political and economic troubles in the past several years. Effects of the 2011 revolution are still being felt, and its economy is still struggling to recover: the GDP growth rate dropped from 5.1% to 1.8% within a 12-month span.</p><p><span></span>Due to a drop of foreign investments, Egypt recently turned from an energy exporter to a net importer, which has had an adverse effect on the country's ability to meet its growing energy demands. The government is planning to import 28.6 million tons of crude oil, LNG, and other oil products worth almost $16 billion in 2015-16. </p><p>Given the right investment and political stability, however, the immense potential of the country's energy industry is not in doubt. The challenges of recent years are seen as a major opportunity for fresh investors; multinational companies are beginning to sign contracts that will eventually mold and transform the landscape of the sector in the years to come.</p><p>Such opportunities for Egypt to capitalize on are the Suez Canal and the Suez-Mediterranean (SUMED) pipelines. Vital transit routes that allow oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) to be transported from the Middle East to European and North American markets, it also provides a chance for Egypt to reassert itself as a dominant player in the region by connecting markets from afar.</p><p>On the domestic front, the government is particularly focused on developing viable and sustainable sources of renewable energy, with a target to supply 20% of total energy needs by 2020.  In January, the government selected bids from 18 countries worth a total investment value of $5 billion to assist its effort to build renewable energy plants with a total capacity of 4,000 MW, ranging from solar to wind power projects.</p><p><span></span>Additionally, UK energy group BG is planning to invest $4 billion over two years, and the Italian group Eni is prepared to spend $5 billion over the next five years. Other companies such as BP, Siemens, Masdar, and ACWA Power have already signed agreements with the Egyptian government and have plans to expand their investments in the energy sector.</p><p><span></span>Against this extraordinary backdrop, The Future of Energy in Egypt (event website: futureofenergyegypt.com; corporate website: futurenrgcorp.com) will be an essential event in the broader industry conversation. With meaningful discussions on industry trends and developments, the conference will also help re-orient the future of the industry, putting Egypt firmly back on a path to international prominence and success.<span></span></p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Panama, May 14, 2015</strong>—TBY is currently working on the second yearly publication focused on Panama.</p><p>Álvaro Alemán, Minister of the Presidency, recently held a meeting with TBY to discuss the main highlights achieved by the government, and its targets for the 2015-2019 strategic plan.</p><p>During the interview, the Minister underlined the importance of the recent Summit of the Americas for Panama. The Panamanian government successfully hosted the seventh Summit of the Americas on April 10-11, welcoming more than 30delegations of heads of state and governments from across the Americas.</p><p>The event underlined Panama's role in the American continent. Álvaro Alemán told TBY, “we have been able to position Panama as a mediator, as a country that tends to help and resolve disputes. Unfortunately, we had moved away from that position in the past few years of the previous government, and now we have regained a position whereby we maintain good relations both with the US and with the leading countries in the region; we have good relations with the countries that form the Alliance of the Pacific, we enjoy good relations with the Caribbean countries, and we have regained a strong foreign policy position as a country that allows us to act as a problem solver in the hemisphere, and must recognize in this connection the leadership of President Varela and the Vice-President and Foreign Minister Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado. Establishing dialogue is fundamental, and a part of the government's new vision."</p><p>The Summit of the Americas focused not only on economic trends, but also on social priorities. Despite the rapid economic development enjoyed by the countries of the region, it is clear that wealth is not equally distributed among all citizens. Within the continent, we can still find families living in poverty and extreme poverty; there are health and education deficiencies, and we face great security challenges as well as an increase in organized crime all over the hemisphere. There are some pending tasks regarding equity and integration in the region, as well as environmental, energy, and migration issues.</p><p>Also during the interview, Alemán stressed the importance of social reforms for Varela's government; “We are a country of low unemployment and inflation, and have projected growth of more than 6%.</p><p>I am confident that we will exceed this level, because one of our main objectives is to reduce the rate of poverty, which has dropped significantly, today standing at about 23-24% of the population. Extreme poverty is now down to about 10% of the population. We want to reduce it even further, and feel that if we continue to experience high economic growth and receive foreign investment, we will be able to create the conditions necessary to allow people to step out of poverty and enter the middle class. Part of our goal is to improve education and social programs for people in the lower tier of economic society."</p><p>The creation of a transparent business environment is one of the main premises for any country to attract and boost FDI; in that regard, the Minister commented: There are more than 100 multinationals active today in Panama with regional headquarters in the capital. We are promoting a new law to increase the number of international companies in Panama, and are in discussions with the Colón Free Zone to enhance their logistics capacity and offer a free zone to investors in Panama. It is important to note that we are actively combatting corruption and actively promoting the rule of law, because the first requirement a country has in order to attract foreign investment is the rule of law‚Ä¶ we are now aware that our country must have a strong rule of law in order to attract foreign investment."</p><p>The complete interview with Álvaro Alemán will be featured in The Business Year: Panama 2015.</p><p>The Business Year (TBY) is a leading provider of business information and a publisher of annual trade and investment resources. TBY meets with the world's top political, commercial, and industrial leaders to deliver targeted information, in-depth analysis, and strategic advice to the global business community on economic trends and investment opportunities.</p>]]></body1content>

As an incisive publication, <em>The Business Year </em>has long highlighted both economic challenges and opportunities. It is therefore a crucial platform connecting the reader with the business world through incisive and up-to-date coverage of the key developments in global commerce and industry."</p><p>“Our coverage is a testimony to Lebanon's resilience," added Rice. “The challenges of the region are clear, but the business leaders and policy makers we spoke to are responding with ingenuity. We feature a number of Lebanese businesses that are diversifying their geographic footprints beyond the region and leveraging Lebanon's strong human capital base to find domestic growth in healthcare tourism, fund management, digital media, and agriculture. Our coverage runs the full economic spectrum, but I believe the overarching theme this year is opportunity amid complexity."</p><p>The opening ceremony was followed by a press conference, where the attendees had occasion to discuss the latest trends and opportunities in the Lebanese market with the representatives from TBY and the Minister of Economy himself.</p><p>With more than 120 exclusive interviews, <em>The Business Year: Lebanon </em>is the most comprehensive publication in English on the Lebanese economy to date, and an important tool for international investors seeking opportunities in the region. In addition to an estimated internal circulation of approximately 12,000 physical copies and widely circulated digital versions available on iPad, iPhone, and Android applications, physical copies will reach out to over 97,700 subscribers worldwide.</p><p>Following the success of its 2012, 2013 and 2014 editions, <em>The Business Year: Lebanon 2015</em> will provide coverage of all major sectors of the economy and serve as a platform for further analysis on specific topics such as the importance of the banking sector in the Lebanese economy, Lebanese businesses succeeding abroad, privatization of the country's telecoms sector, and Beirut's potential as a health tourism destination. </p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dubai, November 18, 2014—</strong>Dubai FDI, the investment development agency in the Department of Economic Development (DED), in partnership with the leading international business consultancy and publishing company, The Business Year, has launched the third edition of its special publication on the business and investment landscape in Dubai.</p><p><em>'The Business Year: Dubai 2014'</em> was released at a special ceremony in Dubai today. The publication comprises around 160 interviews from top executives and government officials, including an exclusive foreword from His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai.</p><p>“The run-up to Dubai Expo 2020, and the ambitious strategic plans unveiled by individual Emirates as well as the Federation at large, are certain to help the UAE repeat a feat that we have routinely accomplished throughout our illustrious history—to be the best," says His Highness.</p><p>His Excellency Abdullah Al Saleh, Under Secretary for Foreign Trade and Industry at the UAE Ministry of Economy, who was the Guest of Honour at the launch ceremony, said economic policy in the UAE has always stressed on diversification, removing barriers to trade, and creating a level playground for investors and entrepreneurs. “Dubai and its innovative growth agenda has contributed substantially to the UAE success story," added Al Saleh.</p><p>“Globally, doing business is undergoing rapid transformation with knowledge, technology, connectivity, and sustainability being the new keywords. Dubai's development vision combines all these factors, complemented by a strategic location. <em>The Business Year: Dubai 2014</em> provides a comprehensive picture of the emerging Dubai and identifies the engines of its growth for the benefit of the investor community," commented Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of Dubai FDI.</p><p>Ayse Valentin, CEO of The Business Year, said: “We are very proud to continue our collaborative efforts with Dubai FDI and the Department of Economic Development in Dubai. Both organizations have been instrumental in our research and efforts to diagram an exciting and vast economy. We hope that through our analysis we may continue to support the aspirations of Dubai to be one of the premier economic centers in the world."</p><p>The interviews in the publication sum up the importance of the UAE's bilateral relations with partner countries and pinpoint specific business opportunities and initiatives that will sculpt Dubai's economic development. Dubai's potential as a regional hub and bridge to fast-growing markets is captured in the publication for the benefit of investors and businesses worldwide.</p><p>His Excellency Francisco Rivadeneira, Minister of International Trade in Ecuador, speaking in the publication, points to Dubai's proximity to “interesting emerging markets" across the Middle East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia.</p><p>“If Ecuador aims to promote and export its products within the region, Dubai plays a fundamental role," says Rivadeneira, adding that ports in Dubai, Dubai International Airport, and the free trade zones together can connect Ecuadorean companies to promising markets.</p><p>His Excellency Yoon Saang-Jick, Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea, speaks of the UAE's geographical advantage and well-developed and growing non-oil industries, which he says are likely to lead the growth of the UAE economy in future.</p><p>“Dubai accounts for 30% of the UAE economy and has sound finances. In particular, real estate prices, which plummeted after the 2008 financial crisis, are gradually recovering," the Korean minister says, adding that he is looking forward to see more exchanges between SMEs and mutual investment.</p><p>Heads of leading businesses across the region share their views on Dubai's reputation as a hub and facilitator of global trade and business development. </p><p>Speaking of his company's operations based out of Dubai, Jean Claude Farah, President of MEA, APAC, Eastern Europe &amp; CIS of Western Union Financial Services, Inc., says: “In terms of the infrastructure, opportunities, and talent you can hire and recruit to serve your interests as a company, Dubai makes sense for Western Union. A more difficult question to answer would be, 'why not Dubai?' Given all that Dubai has to offer, it was tough to choose any other city."</p><p>“It is a good networking place. Dubai is a fast-growing location. It is safe and secure, and the financial system here is easy to work with," Mike Douglas, President and CEO of the multinational SKA Group, says in his interview with The Business Year: Dubai 2014.</p><p>The launch ceremony was followed by a panel discussion on the Islamic economy, moderated by Leland Rice, Managing Editor, The Business Year. Panelists included Abdullah Al Awar, CEO, Dubai Islamic Economy Development Centre, Jamal Bin Ghalaita, CEO, Emirates Islamic, Badr Buhannad, Chief Audit and Risk Officer at Dubai International Financial Centre, and Randa Bessiso, Director Middle East, Manchester Business School.</p><p><em>The Business Year: Dubai 2014</em> publication will reach a global audience of 87,000 readers via its printed version, while a wider audience will be able to access it through TBY's iPad, iPhone and Android applications.</p>]]></body1content>

The government's policy on the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model better suits the country's new developing model, and Nigeria is now fully open to the foreign community of investors," said the Minister of Information, Labaran Maku, on the occasion of the meeting in Abuja.</p><p>The project, which will see TBY working across the whole spectrum of the country's economy, perfectly aligns with the President's vision of transforming Nigeria from an oil investment destination to a well-diversified, and modern economy that will boost job creation.</p><p>“As the largest economy of the continent, I can see Nigeria growing in importance and becoming an epicenter of excellence not only in Africa, but also internationally," remarked the Ministry's Permanent Secretary, Dr. Folasade Omolara Yemi-Esan.</p><p>As Nigeria prepares to enter the world's top-20 economies by 2020, TBY is strengthening its ties with the Ministry by working in line with the country's process of diversification. “For decades, Nigeria was seen only and exclusively as an oil and gas destination for investments," said TBY's Country Director, Ligia Oliveira Kleber. “The time has come to reverse this trend. This moment represents a turning point in the country's recent history, and TBY will serve Nigeria as a platform to showcase to the foreign investment community its full potential, noticeably in the energy generation, agribusiness, manufacturing, and ICT sectors."</p><p>Present in more than 20 countries worldwide, TBY currently counts on an overall readership of over 95,000 international subscribers. With more than 200 exclusive interviews and an estimated internal circulation of around 10,000 copies, <em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2015</em> will have as its main focus the process of economic diversification that the country is currently undergoing. In this first edition, special emphasis will be given to the President's Transformation Agenda as well as the country's VISION 20:2020 goals. The publication, which will cover all sectors of the economy, will also represent a platform for further analysis on specific topics such as the successful privatization of the power sector or Nigeria's path to become the Meetings, Incentives, Conferencing, and Exhibitions (MICE) hub for West Africa.</p><p><strong>THE NIGERIAN FEDERAL MINISTRY OF INFORMATION</strong></p><p>The Nigerian Federal Ministry of Information (FMI) provides the Nigerian citizenry with timely information on the government's activities, programs, and initiatives. The Ministry serves as the Federal Public Information outfit responsible for professional policy-making, planning, gathering, processing, packaging, and dissemination of essential and vital information that will enhance and facilitate the democratic governance of Nigeria as a Federal Republic. The Ministry develops, designs, and institutionalizes appropriate and generally acceptable public information and communication policies that will promote information management and control in the country.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Saudi Arabia, May 14, 2014</strong>—Leading international business and consultancy firm The Business Year (TBY) signed a far reaching partnership with the Asharqia Chamber of Commerce and Industry on May 15 to facilitate the publication of <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2014. </em>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was agreed upon by Paul Loomis, Country Editor at The Business Year, and Abdulrahman bin Abdullah Al-Wabel, Secretary General of the Asharqia Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p><p>The agreement complements the existing arrangements TBY has reached with the Riyadh and Jeddah Chambers of Commerce, and gives TBY unprecedented scope in all of Saudi Arabia's major commercial centers. TBY's agreements in Saudi Arabia now cover the Kingdom from the east to west, giving TBY unprecedented access to information and business leaders from around the country. <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2014 </em>will feature interviews with business and political leaders and will be distributed extensively around the world. Featuring chapters on diplomacy &amp; politics, economy, finance, energy, real estate &amp; construction, transport, health &amp; education, agriculture, and tourism, the issue aims to be the most comprehensive English-language publication on the Saudi Arabian business environment to date.</p><p>The Asharqia Chamber of Commerce and Industry is one of the nation's historic service organizations, and works to develop the private sector's contribution to the economy in Eastern province. It also invites foreign delegations to the thriving Eastern province and facilitates international trade and investment. Eastern province has a thriving oil and gas services industry, and companies that started in Al Khobar and Dammam regularly pursue business around the world.</p><p>Mr. Abdulrahman Al-Wabel spoke on the importance of the agreement between the Asharqia Chamber and TBY: “The wealth of opportunities in Eastern province reflect the nation's economic progress as a whole. We are proud to partner with an organization like The Business Year, which will shed light on the activities of the Chamber and the region. We hope to encourage further international participation in the Saudi economy through the spread of information."</p><p>Mr. Loomis noted that the Saudi Arabian economy is maturing across all sectors.  “After interviewing the heads of many influential firms in Eastern province, we've noticed a distinct trend toward formalizing governance in family firms and focusing on a few core businesses. Many of these firms have undergone that process in the past decade, and are now internationally competitive. The demand for market intelligence in this region in particular is high because of the Saudi oil industry's global scope."</p><p>TBY's interview-based format ensures that the views of leaders in each sector of the economy are represented. When <em>The Business Year: Saudi Arabia 2014 </em>is published in 3Q2014, TBY will have interviewed over 200 Saudi business leaders and top government officials. These interviews will be featured alongside expert analysis of each sector as well as submissions from guest speakers including international figures commenting on Saudi Arabia's economic future.</p><p><strong>THE </strong><strong>ASHARQIA OF </strong><strong>COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY</strong></p><p>The Asharqia Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry was established in 1952 and is focused on providing services to the private sector in Eastern province. The Chamber's Vision is to lead the development of Eastern Province private sector activities and to be a unique service provider and facilitator for the business community. It hosts many events each year, and regularly invites foreign delegations on trade missions.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nigeria, May 11, 2014</strong>—The World Economic Forum on Africa (WEFA), held in Abuja on May 7-9, has come to a close after three days of deliberations; over 1,200 regional and global leaders from 80 countries worldwide attended the event. The forum, centered on the theme of “Forging Inclusive Growth, Creating Jobs," saw the participation of Nigerian President Jonathan Goodluck, Prime Minister of the Ivory Coast Daniel Kablan Duncan, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, as well as Africa's wealthiest businessman, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, among others. At the event, over $68 billion of investments in the African continent were secured. The Business Year, present in Abuja throughout, covered the three-day event.</p><p>Many varied topics were touched upon during the forum. Addressing the international business community at the opening ceremony, President Jonathan stressed that Africa's progress fundamentally depended on the ability of its leaders to make the necessary decisions that would shape the continent's future economy and society. “The African continent is rising. We must ensure that our poorer and vulnerable neighbors are carried along. We must ensure that growth is inclusive. We must ensure maximum inclusiveness through creating opportunities for people to create opportunities for themselves," he said. “As we debate these issues over the next two days, let us raise our sights, let us think big and bold, and let us think for the long-term."</p><p>Daniel Kablan Duncan, Prime Minister of the Ivory Coast, also spoke, telling <em>TBY</em> that, “The Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS) is the future of our region. As a group we are moving in the right direction. We hope that, in October, the 15 countries can sign a cooperation agreement with the EU. This apart, many of the projects aimed at strengthening the relations between our countries on the continent are already in place. The Trans-African Highway is tangible proof of that.“</p><p>The continent's relationship with China also played a prominent role at the forum. “China intends to continue its large investments in and aid for Africa, with a focus on helping to develop the continent's infrastructure, from aviation to power generation and telecommunications," said Chinese Premier, Li Keqiang, speaking at the first plenary session of the Conference. “We are ready to share with African countries without reservation." On the occasion, investments in financing cooperation with the continent were announced at a total value of $30 billion. “China and Africa face many similar problems and share the same task of growing the economy, raising living standards, and promoting social progress."</p><p>The Chairman of Dangote Group pledged investments on the continent of more than $16 billion over the next five years. The plan, according to his vision, will help Nigeria create over 180,000 new jobs and reestablish a more secure ground for both local and international investors to come." The African environment is fine, we only have to become active," he said, dismissing critics who still regard many African countries as a high-risk investment.</p><p>Meanwhile, as the curtain falls on the event in Nigeria, South Africa prepares to host the 25<sup>th</sup> edition of the World Economic Forum in 2015. The forum, the exact date of which has yet to be confirmed, will take place next June in Capetown.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Nigeria, April 7, 2014—</strong>Following the release of the country's rebased GDP data, Nigeria has emerged as the 26<sup>th</sup> largest economy in the world, thus overtaking South Africa's leading position on the continent. The rebased figures, which put GDP at an estimated $510 billion in 2013, represent an 89% jump in the estimated size of the country's economy.</p><p>The rebasing, which comes after 24 years, reveals a significant change in the structure of Nigeria's economy. The new recalculation, taking into account sectors of the economy previously neglected or inexistent—noticeably the telecommunications and entertainment industry (e.g. Nollywood)—brings to 46 the number of economic activities reported, and paints a picture of a changing economy, with a more diversified and service-oriented growth model.</p><p>“The rebased GDP numbers imply that the level of economic activity is much higher than previously reported," said the Co-ordinating Minister of Economy, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, during a press conference held in Abuja on April 6, 2014.</p><p>“Rebasing GDP provides more accurate data on the economy to enable policy-makers to make informed decisions and policy choices to tackle social problems like poverty and unemployment. As a result, better investment choices are expected to me made, resulting in higher profitability and even higher investments. The exercise will provide significant support for the growing pool of investors."</p><p>Under the new service industry structure, which now accounts for over 50% of overall GDP, information and communication rank high, followed by other driving sectors such as real estate and financial services.</p><p>Over the past few years, according to the IMF, the country has enjoyed high rates of growth with an average of 6.8% from 2005 to 2013, while projections for the current year put the figure at 7.4%.</p><p>The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) is expected to release the final GDP figure for 2013 by June 2014, while 2015 data will be available by 2016 when, as recommended by UN statisticians, another rebasing exercise will be undertaken.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Lagos, February 18, 2014</strong>—Leading international business and consultancy firm The Business Year (TBY) has signed a research partnership with The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) to publish <em>The Business Year: Nigeria 2014. </em>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was agreed upon by Benjamin Ezra Dikki, Director General of BPE; Joe Chingbo Anichebe of BPE; Leland Rice, TBY's Regional Director for Africa; and Ligia Oliveira Kleber, TBY's Country Manager for Nigeria.</p><p>The agreement marked the initiation of TBY's first macroeconomic research project on Nigeria. The annual edition will feature interviews with business and political leaders and will be distributed extensively around the world. Featuring chapters on diplomacy &amp; politics, economy, finance, energy, real estate &amp; construction, transport, health &amp; education, agriculture, and tourism, the issue aims to be the most comprehensive English-language publication on the Nigerian business environment to date.</p><p>BPE's Director General welcomed the partnership and reaffirmed his organization's commitment to informing the international investment community about business opportunities in Nigeria. “This publication will act as a reference point for global investors and will be a vehicle to display Nigeria's transformation agenda and its role as a global center for capital and investment," Mr. Dikki commented.</p><p>BPE is charged with implementing the privatization and commercialization program of the Federal Government of Nigeria. Last year it successfully spearheaded the reformation of the country's power sector, one of the largest privatization efforts on the continent. BPE now has its sights on a number of other priority sectors.</p><p>Mr. Rice notes that the successful privatization of the power sector in Nigeria, in concert strong macro-economic indicators, is driving demand among TBY's readers for further information on the country. “Nigeria is Africa's most populous country and its biggest energy producer, and the rebasing of its GDP later this year may prove it to be the continent's largest economy as well," Rice noted. “These factors, along with the progress of the country's ambitious transformation agenda, are a wake-up call to many potential investors worldwide."</p><p>This economic emergence is coupled with an increasingly prominent role on the world's stage, notes Ms. Kleber. “It's no coincidence that the term MINT is now commonplace within the global financial community," says Kleber. Coined by Jim O'Neill, who authored the BRIC acronym 13 years ago, MINT refers to Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey, countries that many economists believe are the next generation of economic powerhouses. “This language reflects Nigeria's ambition to be among the top-20 economies, and among the most prominent voices of the global political arena, by 2020."</p><p>Over the course of the next several months, TBY will interview over 200 Nigerian business leaders and top government officials. These interviews will be featured along side expert analysis of each sector as well as submissions from guest speakers including international figures commenting on Nigeria's economic future.</p><p><strong>THE BUREAU OF PUBLIC ENTERPRISES (BPE)</strong></p><p>The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) serves as the secretariat of the National Council on Privatisation (NCP) and is charged with the overall responsibility of implementing the council's policies on privatization and commercialization. Its mission is to be the key driver of the government's economic reform program and a resource center for capacity building as well as to sustain the reform agenda.</p><p><a>www.bpeng.org</a></p>]]></body1content>

It is TBY's third edition in the country thanks to its partnership with ProMéxico<strong>, </strong>the trade and investment agency that operates under the aegis of the Secretary of Economy.</p><p>The Executive Vice-President and General Director of AMCHAM, Guillermo Wolf, mentioned that this accord would be very positive for both sides, especially as it comes on the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the NAFTA free trade agreement. Blanca Cisneros, TBY's Country Manager, highlighted that AMCHAM is going to be a strategic partner for the 2014 edition. “The US is Mexico's main trade partner and North America is the destination for over 80% of Mexico's exports," Cisneros commented.</p><p>In addition, Cisneros emphasized her enthusiasm about working in Mexico. “We feel that the Mexican moment is happening now; our team is really excited about all the reforms, though we are waiting until the secondary laws are enacted to see the real effects. This is a great moment for being in Mexico because the whole world is looking at this country, as it offers a huge potential for FDI."</p><p><strong>AMCHAM</strong></p><p>American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico was founded more than 90 years ago, positioning itself as a non-profit and non-partisan organization.  It is affiliated with the two most active and significant international business organizations in the world: the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Association of American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America (AACCLA).  Today, the companies that make up American Chamber/Mexico represent nearly 70% of the foreign direct investment in Mexico, which significantly contributes to economic and trade development and strengthens the bilateral relationship between Mexico and the United States.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mozambique, November 25, 2013</strong>—Leading international research and market intelligence provider The Business Year (TBY) met with HE President Armando Guebuza last week to discuss his achievements over the past eight years and his vision for the future of Mozambique. The TBY team met with HE President Guebuza as part of its ongoing research to prepare The Business Year's second edition on Mozambique; <em>The Business Year: Mozambique 2014</em>, in partnership with the Mozambican Investment Promotion Centre (CPI).</p><p>President Guebuza, who met with TBY Country Manager Ligia Kleber and TBY Country Editor Tyler Mattiace, also spoke about the appeal of Mozambique as a destination for international investment, citing the country's strong legal framework, its resource wealth, its geostrategic location, and its people among the many reasons that investors are flocking to Mozambique. The President emphasized that Mozambique's draw as an investment destination is not a new phenomenon. As President Guebuza explained, “Even before the emergence of our famous mineral resources, Mozambique was growing at a rate of 7% per year. As a result, people felt drawn to invest here."</p><p>President Guebuza also discussed the transformative role that the mineral resources sector is playing in the Mozambican economy. As the President explained, the emergence of coal has driven improvements in Mozambique's rail and port infrastructure, which has an impact across all sectors of the economy. In addition, the President emphasized that as the development of Mozambique's gas reserves proceeds over the coming years, he expects the sector to contribute to the development of other industries such as petrochemicals.</p><p>President Guebuza also addressed the recent instability in the central region of Mozambique with TBY, emphasizing that investors should not be deterred from continuing to do business in the country. As the President stated: “Is it still worth it to invest in Mozambique? Yes." President Guebuza cited the recent municipal elections, for which 85% of the population registered, as proof of the strength and stability of the Mozambican political system.</p><p>Other topics discussed included Mozambique's relations within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP), President Guebuza's achievements over his time in office, and his vision for the country over the coming decade.</p><p>President Guebuza's interview will open TBY's forthcoming second edition on Mozambique, <em>The Business Year: Mozambique 2014</em>, which will once again be published in partnership with the Mozambican Investment Promotion Centre (CPI)<em>. </em>TBY is in the process of finalizing its second edition in Mozambique, after having conducted more than 150 interviews with top decision-makers from every sector of the Mozambican economy such as Millennium bim Chairman Mario Machungo, Anadarko Moçambique President John Peffer, and Vale head Ricardo Saad.</p><p>TBY's investor-focused publications cover every sector in 30 countries around the world through exclusive interviews with heads-of-state, ministers, and top executives from the leading public and private institutions in each economy it covers. <em>The Business Year: Mozambique 2014</em> will be the most comprehensive English-language publication on the Mozambican economy published internationally to date and has been acclaimed by top executives, policy makers, and international media around the world.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dubai, November 12, 2013</strong>—Dubai FDI, the foreign investment promotion office in the Department of Economic Development (DED), has launched the second annual special publication on the business and investment landscape in Dubai, brought out in association with the leading international business consultancy and publishing company The Business Year (TBY), in the presence of Sheikh Maktoum Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Deputy Ruler and Chairman of Dubai Technology and Media Free Zone Authority.</p><p>The launch event was held at the Dubai World Trade Centre today was also attended by His Excellency Sami Al Qamzi, Director General of the Department of Economic Development (DED), Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of Dubai FDI, Betül Çakaloğlu, Regional Director for TBY, Mahmud P.K. Merali, Managing Partner of Merali's, Leland Rice, Managing Editor of TBY and leading executives from the private and public sectors.</p><p>Titled '<em>The Business Year: Dubai 2013</em>,' the printed publication will reach 87,000 readers worldwide in addition to being available on iPad, iPhone, and Android apps. The second edition features 160 interviews and offers the international investor community a comprehensive and first-hand look at Dubai's economic trajectory.</p><p>The edition opens with an “Inside Perspective" by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai. Talking about Dubai's resilience and flexibility in dealing with surrounding variables as well as the goal-bound economic strategies Sheikh Mohammed states that “the country will continue to invest in human resources, update the legal and regulatory frameworks, and further strengthen infrastructure, pursuing new levels of development."</p><p>A variety of high-level interviews across the economic spectrum and reports on the performance of non-oil sectors are among the key features of the 2013 edition. Of Dubai's GDP growth in the first half of 2013, an estimated 28 per cent came from trade, 16 per cent from manufacturing, and 14 per cent from financial enterprises, observes the report.</p><p>“Dubai has a strong vision and a very safe environment for investors. It quickly realizes that it needed to diversify its economy in order to succeed in a non-oil producing environment. There are two specific areas that have contributed most to this success – the Jebel Ali Port and the rapid expansion of Emirates airline. Dubai's successes in attracting inward investment have also been part of a wider strategy that has seen 60% of Dubai's imports actually re-exported to the wider region," Nick Baird, CEO of UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) says in the report.</p><p>The publication also analyzes the impact of the UAE's upgrade to Emerging Market status by MSCI, the stellar performance of the Emirate's capital markets, ambitious projects such as the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid (MBR) City, as well as large-scale developments in air, land, and sea transport. Also of note are focus pieces on Dubai's World Expo 2020 bid, Vision 2020, and renewable energy, as well as an exclusive new chapter on the maritime sector.</p><p>“Dubai is an important player for Ecuador due to the investment and co-operation opportunities. There is huge potential between our petrochemical industries but especially in terms of clean energy, where Ecuador has a great interest and Dubai has shown significant global leadership," Ricardo Patino, Ecuadorean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Integration says in his interview to <em>The Business Year: Dubai 2013</em>.</p><p>“Dubai has embarked on a new era of growth and given the emirate's reputation for achieving the unthinkable the international business community should be informed of these developments in all possible means. <em>The Business Year: Dubai 2013</em> is a remarkable effort towards such communication," commented Al Gergawi.</p><p>“Given the level of dynamism currently being seen in Dubai, this year's edition features a number of new projects and policies that are shaping the emirate's economic future," says Betül Çakaloğlu. “This includes megaprojects that are cementing Dubai's position as a global trade and logistics center, such as the opening of Al Maktaum International Airport to passengers and the development of Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid (MBR) City, new rail links between Dubai's industrial hubs and Saudi Arabia and Oman, and a new terminal at Jebel Ali, which will make it one of the largest ports in the world. These projects, in addition to a return of confidence in real estate as well as ambitious new targets for tourism and other strategic sectors, are creating demand from global investors for fresh insights on the people and policies that are driving Dubai's economic trajectory."</p><p>The most comprehensive and updated English language review of the economic capabilities of Dubai available internationally, <em>The Business Year: Dubai 2013 </em>will help investors and businesses to leverage the strategic advantages of Dubai as a regional hub and bridge to fast-growing markets around the world.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dominican Republic, October 4th, 2013</strong>—Leading international business and consultancy firm The Business Year (TBY) has signed this morning a partnership agreement with the CEI-RD, for the preparation of its second edition in the Dominican Republic, with the aim of presenting the views and perspectives of more than 100 political leaders and major players in the business arena and the ideas that are transforming the Dominican Republic into a key business center in the region.</p><p>The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in Santo Domingo between the Executive Director of the CEI-RD, Jean Alain Rodriguez, and TBY's Regional Director, Peggy Rosiak.</p><p>The 2013 edition, which was the most comprehensive report in English on the Dominican economy so far, was the result of collaboration between CEI-RD and TBY and is an important tool for investors who want to know about the investment climate in the country and obtain accurate information about legal and tax regulations.</p><p>The Executive Director of the CEI-RD, Jean Alain Rodriguez, congratulated the TBY team for helping to expand the exposure of the business sectors in the Dominican Republic. Peggy Rosiak said TBY's vision for the Dominican Republic was very positive. “In the 2013 edition of the publication, TBY covered all the relevant sectors of the economy, highlighting the role of public investment to drive strong economic growth and foreign investment opportunities in the country," she said. Rosiak added that in the 2014 edition TBY is working to portray the Dominican Republic as the hub of the Caribbean, also emphasizing two of the cornerstones of President Medina's policies: education and agriculture.</p><p>In addition, TBY's Country Editor for the Dominican Republic, Pablo Lopez, emphasized the wide dissemination of the publication. “The Business Year, which counts the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the CEI-RD as its strategic partners for its 2013 edition, is an independent publication that is published in our offices in Istanbul and London, and is distributed worldwide through subscription and sponsored conferences, such as the G20 or the financial summit in Istanbul, among many others," he said. TBY reaches international investors and global leaders, in addition to being widely circulated throughout the country. The first edition of the publication, Dominican Republic 2013, has been circulating for about a month in the country.</p><p><strong>CEI-RD</strong></p><p>The Center for Export and Investment of the Dominican Republic (CEI-RD) was founded in 2003 with the goal of increasing the Dominican Republic's competitiveness as an international market player. The Center aims to satisfy the needs of its clients based on the continued improvement of services offered in the areas of export and investment assistance, advocacy, incentives, business information, legal advice, training, and logistics support. <a>www.cei-rd.gov.do</a></p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>From June 28 through July 1, The Business Year attended the Global 2013 SMART Partnership Dialogues in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and presented the Dialogue's official publication to heads of state, ministers, and business leaders from around the world. Among those in attendance were Tanzania's President Jakaya Kikwete, Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni, Sri Lanka's President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak and Ex-Prime Minister Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, King Mswati III of Swaziland, Zambia's Vice-President Guy Scott, and Botswana's Vice-President Mopati Merafhe. President Jakaya Kikwete hosted the Dialogues and was in attendance from its first hours to its last. He opened the ceremonies with a speech in which he said that technology would be crucial in allowing Tanzania and the East African region to “leap frog" forwards in its economic development.</p><p>The 2013 Global SMART Partnership Dialogue began in 1995 in Langkawi, Malaysia and has since taken place almost every year in countries ranging from Barbados to Lesotho. It has grown from a gathering of scientists and policymakers into one of the world's most important discussions about technology and development. The Business Year participated in three days of productive roundtable discussions with academic experts and prominent businesspeople from around the African continent and the world. The focus of the Dialogues was leveraging technology for socioeconomic transformation, but individual discussions ranged from preventative community health fostered by communications technology, to mobile money, to government programs to incubate new and innovative tech companies.</p><p>The Business Year Produced the Global 2013 SMART Partnership Dialogue's official publication in partnership with the President's Office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. It included interviews with His Excellency President Kikwete, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Bernard Membe, Chief Secretary Ombeni Sefue, Minster of Energy Sospeter Muhongo, Minister of Communication, Science, and Technology Makame M. Mbarawa, and Governor of the Bank of Tanzania Benno Ndulu, among many others. Although the government of Tanzania was well represented, the publication focused on tech startups, the potential of mobile money, technology in Tanzania's tourism sector, and the Global 2013 SMART Partnership Dialogue's impact on the nation's future.</p><p>The gathering corresponded with the timing of US President Barack Obama's visit to the country, another indicator of the importance of the region and Tanzania's geostrategic significance. Throughout the duration of the Dialogues heads of state circulated among roundtable discussions and shared their views on technology, development, and strategies for improving economic growth with innovative technological solutions. This gave attendees the unique opportunity of conversing with presidents and prime ministers instead of listening to their speeches. The fresh format of the dialogue fitted the energetic atmosphere surrounding Africa's economic prospects in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and provided a unique context for participants and leaders to shape the continent's future.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p>On 7 April, 2013, Baku, Azerbaijan was host to the World Economic Forum's first Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the South Caucasus and Central Asia. The event gathered a range of global stakeholders in candid discussions on economic integration and sent the global investor community its latest signal of the rising importance of a region dubbed “the new Silk Road."</p><p>According to Claus Shwab, Founder and Executive Chairman of the influential World Economic Forum, the choice of venue was strategic. “Azerbaijan in many ways represents a microcosm of the region's great opportunities," he said. “The country has registered impressive growth rates thanks to responsible exploitation of its exceptional resource potential. At the same time it has shown a unique will and skill in using these resources to support the diversification of the country's economy through some very wise reforms."</p><p>High-level speakers from the public and private sector alike commented on the region's growth trajectory. Azerbaijan's production of natural gas, for example, has grown 200% in the last eight years. Kazakhstan's Kashagan field is estimated to be the world's 6<sup>th</sup> largest untapped oil field. Turkmenistan, meanwhile, has the 4<sup>th</sup> largest natural gas reserves in the world. FDI throughout the region has increased nine fold between 2000 and 2009.</p><p>At the center of the discussions was how a more integrated South Caucasus and Central Asia could connect these centers of growth to become the world's latest frontier opportunity. According to the World Economic Forum, it is estimated that regional integration could result in a 100% growth of GDP per capita in just 10 years.</p><p>The event was structured around four themes: energy and natural resources; entrepreneurship and human capital; finance and long-term investment; and trade and supply chains. According to Schwab, the dialogue was the starting point for a longer-term process that “will engage a broad set of international and regional stakeholders in a strategic reflection of prospects for regional economic integration."</p><p>Within the discussion, a number of dominant themes emerged, such as the proposed Trans-Anatolian Pipeline [TANAP]. With construction set to begin in 2013 or 2014, TANAP will deliver gas from Azerbaijan's Shah Deniz field to Europe through Turkey. “I think TANAP is the most concrete project among the other projects that were discussed today," Taner Yƒ±ldƒ±z, Turkey's Minister of Energy, told <em>TBY</em>. “As a project, TANAP is the physical manifestation of the regional integration we are discussing here."</p><p>Another major point of discussion was governance, stability, and predictability. On this topic, Azerbaijan scored high marks from major stakeholders such as BP. “Azerbaijan has never changed so much as a comma in our production supply agreements," noted Gordon Birrell, BP's Regional President for Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. “That's the kind of stability investors need."</p><p>Within the discussion on nurturing human capital, a particular emphasis was on the role of entrepreneurship in completing the shift from central planning to a market economy among the former Soviet states. “Entrepreneurship is the energy of the future for this region," noted Prince Andrew, the Duke of York.</p><p>Perhaps the underlying theme across all the segmented discussions was diversification, a topic underscored by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev from the outset of the event.</p><p>“Our economic development started with the energy sector, and still the energy sector is the most attractive for foreign investment, but our main objective now is to diversify the economy," noted Aliyev. “In order to do that we need to present ourselves to the world business community not only as a country with an important geographic location and natural resources, but also as a country which is committed to reforms, transformation, and diversification."</p><p>Having attended the seven preceding World Economic Forum events in Davos, Aliyev also noted the role of the Forum in promoting his country's diversification. “The World Economic Forum has created opportunities to connect with potential stakeholders who might not otherwise be fully aware of the full-range of opportunities in Azerbaijan."</p><p>The two-day event marked the start of an intensive 18-month Forum initiative, <em>Scenarios for the South Caucasus and Central Asia, </em>aimed at raising issues of regional integration by creating dialogues about possible economic and geopolitical situations that could play out between now and 2030.</p>]]></body1content>

It's a publication that has been covering business and economic stories in countries around the world for a number of years. Given their experience of interviewing and working with celebrated and successful entrepreneurs, companies and high-profile policy-makers we're thrilled to welcome them to the sultanate. Oman already enjoys worldwide recognition among businesses thanks to the outstanding work and achievements of PAIPED. Hopefully, <em>The Business Year</em> will help us build and expand upon that awareness in boardrooms and amongst senior decision makers both regionally and internationally. Indeed, it's my job and that of my colleagues to influence the plans of chairmen and chief executives considering expansion and or relocation to the Gulf and attract more talent, jobs and investment to Oman."</p><p>The Business Year is a leading international publisher of annual periodicals on countries and economies around the world. Betul Cakaloglu, Regional Director for TBY, commented:<strong> “</strong>We are hugely excited about this new project in Oman and are delighted to be working together with our partner PAIPED to promote Oman's broad variety of investment opportunities and bright economic prospects.

In response to dwindling national reserves of crude oil, Vision 2020 aims to reduce oil's contribution to GDP to 9% in 2020 compared with 41% in 2009. This will provide a sustainable future for the country, based on increasing activity in key sectors such industry and tourism, and greater exploitation of gas reserves. This is underpinned by huge state investment in the nation's infrastructure, constructing new roads, airports, railways and ports. TBY aims to showcase the opportunities this expanding economy presents through the ideas and opinions of the country's top business and political leaders.</p><p><strong>PAIPED</strong></p><p>The Public Authority for Investment Promotion and Export Development was founded by Royal Decree in 1997 to facilitate investment in Oman and develop the export of Omani products and services.

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ecuador, February 21, 2013—</strong>Leading international business and consultancy company The Business Year (TBY) has signed a partnership agreement to publish <em>The Business Year: Ecuador 2013 </em>with the Vice-Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Integration and Pro Ecuador. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed in Quito by Francisco Rivadeneira, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Integration, and Peggy Rosiak, Regional Manager of TBY.<strong></strong></p><p>The event marked the official launch of TBY's second macroeconomic research project on Ecuador. The report will be released in the second half of 2013 and will be distributed extensively, both locally and internationally.</p><p>The Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Integration Francisco Rivadeneira welcomed the partnership and stated that he was impressed by TBY's extensive work in Ecuador and was proud to have been part of it. “TBY will do much to promote the country's image internationally and to position Ecuador in the international business scene. It is a powerful tool to attract foreign investment, promote tourism to the country, and help business relations between Ecuadorean businessmen and entrepreneurs from around the world," the Vice-Minister said, adding that “this is a very interesting edition because it incorporates the vision many opinion leaders have on the situation in the country, of Ecuador and its potential, fundamental factors in the country's current government, fundamental factors in each sector, and also, very importantly, factors in academia." Concluding, he said: “[it is] definitely a great support to the hard work we do to raise awareness of the opportunities and investment potential of our country."</p><p>Peggy Rosiak was delighted to be part again of TBY's second project in Ecuador, particularly at a time when demand for information on the country is at an all-time high. “It is an incredibly exciting time to be working in Ecuador once again and to be providing essential information for international investors. The business world is watching Ecuador mainly because of its non-renewable resources, but we are looking forward to highlighting the diverse nature of business opportunities here from transport to ICT and everything in between," she said.</p><p>Ecuador has banked on high petrol prices since it renegotiated its oil contracts in 2010, the result of which has helped support increased public spending and subsequent non-oil sector growth of up to 9%. As the country now looks to return to the days of trade surpluses, a growing transport infrastructure network and an expanding refining industry look to keep the economy moving. TBY aims to showcase the opportunities this deepening economy presents through the ideas and opinions of the country's top business and political leaders.</p><p><em>The Business Year: Ecuador2013</em> will be the most comprehensive English-language review of the economy published internationally to date. TBY's business intelligence reviews have been acclaimed by top executives, policy makers, and international media all around the world, including representatives from the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, the World Economic Forum, the International Finance Corporation, and the Asian Development Bank.</p><p>Over the course of the next several months, TBY will interview over 200 Ecuadorean business leaders and top government officials. These interviews will be featured alongside expert analysis of each sector as well as submissions from guest speakers including international figures commenting on Ecuador's economic growth.</p><p><strong>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TRADE AND INTEGRATION</strong></p><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Integration is the rector of international politics and is responsible for the management and coordination of it, Latin American integration, and responding to the foreign trade interests of the Ecuadorean people, who will be accountable for their decisions and actions in compliance with constitutional principles and the norms of international law, within the framework of national development plans. The Ministry is a public law institution with its official corporate headquarters in the city of Quito, maintains two Under-Secretaries: one in the city of Guayaquil and one in the city of Cuenca, two regional offices, one in the city of Manta and other in the city of Lago Agrio, 44 embassies, 77 consulates rented, 55 honorary consulates, 25 business offices, and five permanent missions abroad.</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ecuador, November 27, 2012—</strong>Leading international business and consultancy company The Business Year (TBY) launched its Ecuador 2012 publication during a breakfast conference at Hotel Dann Carlton in Quito on Tuesday, November 27, 2012. The launch of the 2012 issue was attended by over 70 of the country's leading business executives and public figures and featured speeches by Francisco Rivadeneira, Vice-Minister of Foreign Trade and Integration; Rubén Moran, Coordinating Vice-Minister of Production, Employment, and Competitiveness; Patricio Romero, Director of Huawei Enterprise Business Group, Ecuador; and Leland Rice, TBY's Regional Editor.</p><p>The publication, which is the most comprehensive English-language review of the Ecuadorean economy to date, is the result of a partnership between TBY and PRO ECUADOR, the National Institute of Export and Investment Promotion. The comprehensive research represents PRO ECUADOR's ongoing efforts to provide high-quality economic intelligence to the global investor community.</p><p>Vice-Minister Rivadeneira congratulated the TBY team for helping to broaden the exposure of Ecuador's business climate. He stated: “The Business Year is going to help us promote the image of our country and position it at the international level, especially in the business scope. This publication is a powerful tool for the attraction of foreign investment, the promotion of tourism in the country, and the creation of businesses between national entrepreneurs and business people all around the world."</p><p>Regional Editor Leland Rice noted that TBY's view on Ecuador was positive, due in large part to a sustainable economic model. “Ecuador is unique in that it has struck the rare balance between harnessing its natural resources for economic growth while at the same time protecting its environment and ensuring the social welfare of its people," he noted.</p><p>Rice also emphasized public investment in agriculture, real estate, transportation, and tourism that have worked to develop the country beyond its hydrocarbon revenues. “We are particularly excited about mining," he noted. “A number of large projects are now moving from exploration to production as Ecuador begins tapping its massive mineral reserves, which at current international prices are valued at $185 billion."</p><p><em>The Business Year: Ecuador 2012</em> features over 150 interviews, including Jeannette Sánchez, Coordinating Minister of Economic Policy; Santiago León, Coordinating Minister of Production, Employment, and Competitiveness; Pedro Delgado, President of the Board of the Central Bank of Ecuador; Jorge Glas Espinel, Minister of the Coordination of the Strategic Sectors; and Efraín Vieira, General Manager of the Ecuadorean Social Security Institute Bank.</p><p>The publication is available on TBY's website: <a>http://www.thebusinessyear.com</a></p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Dubai, October 7, 2012</strong>—Leading international business consultancy and publishing company The Business Year (TBY) launched its Dubai 2012 publication at a conference in Dubai on Saturday, October 7. The launch was well attended by the country's leading business executives and public sector leaders, including HH Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, CEO of Emirates Group, and featured speeches by the Director General of the Department of Economic Development (DED), HE Sami Al Qamzi, the CEO of the Foreign Investment Office of Dubai (FDI), Fahad Al Gergawi, and TBY's Editorial Director, Jason J. Nash. The publication also features a foreword from HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice-President and Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai.</p><p>Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of FDI, congratulated the TBY team for providing a high-quality and intelligent business guide that will be extremely beneficial to foreign investors worldwide. He stated, “it's a first-hand account of how Dubai makes things happen." He went on to explain that Dubai's business landscape has experienced remarkable changes recently and “The Business Year: Dubai 2012 captures those changes with authentic testimonials on their outcomes from the businesses and global trade." During his speech, Fahad Al Gergawi spoke of Dubai's “unique abilities in sustaining prosperity in the new world" and also expressed the “significance [of Dubai] as a catalyst for global trade." Al Gergawi also highlighted Dubai's geographical advantage for international trade as well as recent initiatives by the government to maintain its high levels of economic activity.</p><p>Another key speaker at the launch was HE Sami Al Qamzi, the Director General of DED. He also praised TBY on the way it “covers key sectors including finance, industry, retail, energy, green technology, ICT, transport, telecommunications, real estate, health, and education." Al Qamzi spoke of the Emirates “iconic institutions" and how the people of Dubai had “opened doors to innovative ideas and talent, and turned adversities into opportunities." Like Fahad Al Gergawi, HE Sami AL Qamzi expressed the importance of Dubai's geographical location, “standing at the center of trade between the Middle East and Asia linking Latin America, Africa, and beyond, Dubai is shaping and catalyzing this new world of trade and investment flows." Al Qamzi also stated his belief that the future was bright for Dubai, as it becomes a global hub as “economic activity as well as capital shifts to new trade centers in the emerging markets." The Director General finished by congratulating TBY for its ability to convey the business community's insights; “you will find the best minds that lead Dubai's evolution into an economic nerve center of the future sharing their knowledge and critical insights."</p><p>TBY's Jason J. Nash commented on Dubai's tradition of trading and how this had allowed it “to become a global entrepôt whose influence extends well beyond the Arabian Gulf." He commented on the UAE and Dubai's successful growth figures for 2012 and also went on to express a need to remember “external factors," that could affect growth such as “the movement of capital and trade from traditional western economies to high growth areas in Asia." However, Nash expressed how “Dubai is far from naïve" and “has demonstrated leadership as a safe and successful place to do business for all the good times and the hard times." He also mentioned how the “Arab Spring" had underlined Dubai's position as a “stable location of operations." He continued his speech by discussing Dubai's swift development and how he was impressed that “in such a short space of time Dubai has transformed itself into being a city that others emulate around the world." He finished by saying “what has made the Emirates such a world-class center is a combination of welcoming traditions and the entrepreneurship of Dubai's national population as well as the aspirations of those who have come from all corners of the globe to take part in the Emirate's transformation."</p>]]></body1content>

		<body1content><![CDATA[<p><strong>Mexico, August 21, 2012—</strong>Leading international business and consultancy company The Business Year (TBY) launched its Mexico 2012 publication at a breakfast conference in the InterContinental Hotel in Mexico City on Wednesday August 22. The launch of the 2012 report was attended by over 130 of the country's leading business executives and public sector leaders, and featured speeches by the Secretary of the Economy, Bruno Ferrari García de Alba, the CEO and Director General of ProMéxico, Carlos Guzmán Bofill, TBY's Mexico Country Manager Anna Raymi Marata, and the company's Editorial Director, Jason J. Nash.</p><p>Bruno Ferrari, the Secretary of the Economy, congratulated TBY's team for helping to reinvigorate pride in the strength of the local economy. He stated “historically there has been little positive talk about Mexico [domestically], and the efforts of TBY help us to see a different vision of the country and to understand how positively opportunities within the country are seen by the international community". Ferrari also praised the “efforts being made to create the prosperous Mexico that we all want to achieve", highlighted within the report. After reviewing the successes the country has achieved in the areas of financial responsibility, foreign trade policy, and regional integration over recent years, he stressed the need to continue reforms concerning the labor and energy markets to improve economic growth. Ferrari also stressed the need to balance economic growth with the development of the healthcare and education sectors, so as to “create a qualified workforce and, above all, talent."</p><p>At the breakfast launch, Carlos Guzmán, CEO and Director General of ProMéxico, told the audience, “Currently, Mexico is one of the best destinations for investment, and this will continue in the future. It is enough to read the 220 pages of The Business Year to understand this fact." He underlined that “Mexico was now in fashion" as a result of its “open economy, domestic market, human talent, privileged geographical position, solid industrial experience" and “our vocation in medium and high-tech production." He revealed that according to research, Mexico was now the “third largest exporter of medium and high-tech products internationally" in GDP percentage terms, trailing only Germany and South Korea.</p><p>TBY's Editorial Director, Jason J. Nash, commented on Mexico's past decade of successful economic and trade diversification, and described the country as being at the “epicenter of a 'generation of change.'" While characterizing Mexico's NAFTA allies as a “strong component underpinning trade and development," he saw that the “opportunities for future growth lie with the emerging economies of the South and in Asia." He urged Mexico's public and private sector leaders to utilize the opportunity presented by the passing of the 2009 PPP law to create a long-term strategic transport plan at a federal level. “More needs to be done to identify key projects, nodal points, and corridors that can upgrade Mexico's transport system between North and South, East and West," he advised the launch audience. </p>]]></body1content>
