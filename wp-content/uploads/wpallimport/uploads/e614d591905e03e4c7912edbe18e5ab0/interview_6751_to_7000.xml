		<title><![CDATA[All About Innovation]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-about-innovation]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies underpinned your 17% YoY increase in profits?</h4><p>It all boils down to innovation. At Zenith, we try to look at how to do things better, and differently. The bottom-line is, how do we connect with our customers and add value to their business? We have seen that, over time, once a customer believes that there is value derived from your business they will come to you. Our improvements in profitability QoQ between the previous and the current year boil down to what we have been able to do with our customers. Besides this, we have also gained market share because of the quality of our service.</p><h4>Zenith opened a branch in Dubai and hopes to consolidate its place in international markets. How do these actions complement each other?</h4><p>In West African countries and in the UK, we have done extremely well. We wanted to be very compact, because at the end of the day you need to have checks to ensure that service is up to speed and that there is uniformity in delivery. Our branch in Dubai is intended to serve the growing market in Asian countries, and Dubai is in a strategic location. We can serve most of our customers in Asia from there.</p><h4>How do you plan to balance your branch growth with the soft growth of payments and IT-driven tools?</h4><p>From day one, we have embraced the most modern IT infrastructure, and we will continue to do that. However, it is important that payment systems, electronic banking, and online banking, should not replace branches at multiple locations, but instead complement them. Nigeria is still highly under-banked, and electronic payments will encourage a lot of the un-banked to bank. We are going to ensure that we use mobile payment channels to compliment our branch outlet. These payment systems are not a mutually exclusive strategy. They have helped in terms of our client base, which has grown and customer confidence has been greatly enhanced.</p><h4>How have the pressure on the currency and the Forex restrictions affected your business?</h4><p>The challenge that we face is not the fault of any specific actor. Commodities like petrol and crude oil are not completely different from other commodities, such cocoa, cotton, and rubber. The prices naturally fluctuate and at some point they will peak, and naturally fall. The way that markets react is what really matters. Naturally, it is bound to affect us, and the price of crude oil has dropped from over $100 per barrel, to on average $55, a decline of about 50%. However, the way we have reacted as a country has been quite positive. We have taken some proactive steps and the economy is undergoing the necessary transition. The government and the Central Bank are encouraging the economic players here to look inwards and see how we can either apply import substitution, or expand their base and develop the local industry. I am not opposed to the Forex restrictions. We have over 10 rice mills in the country today, and some of these millers say that they were given incentives to set them up. The CBN has taken a step in the right direction, and they have the backing of the entire banking industry. If we look inwards, we can actually conserve a lot of foreign exchange, and we can employ more people who are going to go back into agriculture. We cannot continue to import endlessly. It is really important to make the distinction. We are challenged for now as an economy, but the way we are responding is quite positive and over time expect to see positive growth.</p><h4>Zenith is often considered Nigeria's international bank. How did you achieve that?</h4><p>Our success is largely a product of our client-base. We have the largest number of multinationals as customers, and that is a major endorsement for the brand and for the bank. If most of the multinationals, across all sectors, chose Zenith Bank over international banks here, it sends a strong message. Apart from the US, we have covered almost all the key financial markets of the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Growth will definitely be subdued because of the challenges in the economy, but in the long term the potential is massive and will present investment opportunities. From a banking perspective, we mirror the economy. When the economy is under pressure, it resonates in the financial system. We are committed to looking at innovative ways to even gain more market share.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[strong-relationships]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Mexican market developed for DB Schenker over its time here?</h4><p>DB Schenker has undergone several different stages in Mexico. We have been in Mexico for almost 40 years, which makes us the third oldest country for DB Schenker in Latin America, only behind Argentina and Brazil. Next year, we are anticipating that we will have around 500 employees in Mexico and a revenue stream of over ‚¬100 million. The importance of Mexico for the organization is obvious when you consider that other major markets in Latin American are struggling. Our strategy has always been to maintain offices all over the country; we will be in close physical proximity to our customers, which will facilitate building strong relationships.</p><h4>You are among the top three players in your sector. What distinguishes DB Schenker from its competition?</h4><p>Almost 50% of our costs are related to human resources. Our biggest differentiator in this market is our staff. We take care of them, we train them, and we put them in management programs, which I believe translates to a low turnover rate among our customers. Our customers usually work with us for a long time, for example LÓreal has worked with us for over 15 years.</p><h4>How has your sectorial focus changed over the past few decades, and what does that say about the Mexican economy?</h4><p>We are involved in almost every vertical market in Mexico, whether it is automotive, consumer goods, aerospace, fashion, or retail. In the past, one of our core businesses was perishable exports, exporting handicrafts, and relocation services. When it comes to industry, Mexico is on the edge of becoming a developed country, because we do business here like they do in the US or Germany.</p><h4>What effect will the energy reforms have on growth for your business?</h4><p>It does not help that the oil prices are low now, but in the mid term it will be a booming market for us. In the past, the market was dominated by Pemex, but now investments are pouring in from other companies.</p><h4>How important is the aerospace sector for you?</h4><p>On a worldwide basis, we have a business unit designed specifically for aerospace. In Mexico, we have what we call an AOG desk. AOG stands for aircraft on ground, which implies that you have to move spares and parts from one point of the world to the other in order to avoid a plane standing still. At our offices, we have a system through which you can see which part numbers are flying where, arrival times, who is picking up what, and who is going to deliver the goods to the airport in order to install it in the aircraft. It is rather unique in Mexico.</p><h4>What have been the challenges in expanding the land transport segment?</h4><p>The first challenge is to get the transport management system (TMS), which can interface with different subcontracting carriers. My customers receive a platform via which they can see their shipment moving from A to B, even though the carrier can change. That is one of the challenges, and we are working with our colleagues in the US to make a uniform platform for all of our customers. The second challenge is to get the right carriers on board. It is a segmented market, as there are hundreds of carriers that are international, local, and small. Getting a matrix of quality carriers that comply with health and safety, social security, and other laws is not easy. The third challenge is that the margins are rather low in land transport. NAFTA trucking for us represents less than 10% of our revenue, and land transport is mostly focused on trade with the US. What is interesting for us is that 80% of the trade of Mexico is with the US; if only 10% of my business represents the US, then there is a large gap to be covered.</p><h4>How big is trade with South America and Central America for you?</h4><p>Today, our biggest markets are Europe and Asia. Asia is heavily involved in ocean freight, while Europe dominates consumer goods. On the import side, we could have good business with Argentina and Chile for commodities. For instance, from Argentina we bring in lemon peel, which is manufactured and used later on to make aromas and salts. With Brazil, we work with more industrial goods. On the import side, Latin America is our third largest market, even stronger than the US.</p><h4>How do you integrate sustainable practices into your operations?</h4><p>Our holding company, DB, has announced a strategy called "DB 2020." The project focuses on three pillars: social responsibility, financial responsibility, and ecological responsibility. The company started different programs under ecological responsibility. If you work with more corporate customers, they value sustainability; if you go to the importers of toys from China, however, it is not a high priority. But there are other companies, such as SC Johnson, who value that, and they even ask us what the CO2 footprint of their transport is. We are working toward developing our practices further.</p><h4>Looking ahead, what are your goals for the next few years?</h4><p>We have laid solid groundwork in order to further develop in Mexico. Additionally, even though the traditional air and ocean business is a commodity business, it is very transparent as everyone is aware that the rates for a container can change every two weeks. We also provide services and customs clearance via third parties and land transport, and we intend to invest heavily in land transport, with new offices and cross-border offices to manage cargo at the border. We are also starting a project now to gain market share in the perishable business for our exports. We grew over 30% last year, and we expect to stay on track. Our goals include investing in our larger sales organization and bringing specialists on board for both oil and gas and for perishables, which will help us cover additional areas of the Mexican market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was FSDMoç created?</h4><p>We are a catalytic fund and provide grant funding to financial sector stakeholders to improve the levels of financial inclusion in Mozambique. The project is funded by the DFID, which is part of the UK government and implemented by DAI. FSDMoç will eventually become a Mozambican entity with a formal legal status. We identify and partner with key market stakeholders offering targeted investments and insights to unleash the potential of the financial sector to improve financial inclusion.</p><h4>What is the FSDMoç vision?</h4><p>Our vision is to see a dynamic financial sector offering quality services that enable resilience and economic empowerment for all Mozambicans. We measure our ROI by the number of additional people and SMEs that have access to financial services. Our goal is to have additional 2 million individuals with access to financial services in Mozambique as well as an additional 650 SMEs by 2019. We are attempting to focus on ensuring that the financial sectors provide services to the majority of the population, and that those services actually benefit them and allow them to better manage their livelihoods, cash flow, risks, and insurance use.</p><h4>What are FSDMoç's main objectives?</h4><p>Our goal is to partner with stakeholders in the financial sector. We have five main objectives, one of which is to ensure that there is good uptake of financial services by supporting financial education and literacy, a better understanding of financial services, and strong support for the growth of businesses from a business development perspective. It is a fact that SMEs are risky because they do not have the same financial reports, so we do not know what their profitability is. Poor governance and other issues all represent obstacles to financial inclusion. The difficulty lies in finding a way to support these businesses so that they can grow with the necessary structures in place and use financial services appropriately. We also try to focus on demonstrating good reasons for a financial institution to make an investment in an unbanked company. Our role is really to put comprehensive market information together to demonstrate opportunities in providing financial services. This is something that banks may not have the budget to do, but it is not that they are not interested. We conducted a survey, FinScope, which cost quite a lot of money to do because it is a national representative survey, and this is normally something that the private sector would finance. We are hoping that with better information banks will have a stronger understanding of what the opportunities are. We do a lot of work around presenting that business case in a variety of different ways by completing market segmentation tasks. The third objective is to partner with financial institutions to help them innovate. Agent banking is about entering into an agreement with an agent that is not a bank to provide basic banking services. This could be a supermarket, a petrol station, or a small grocery shop. They act as an agent for the bank and find a way to reduce costs instead of setting up a bank branch with staff and overheads. Essentially, you are just providing a point of sale machine, maybe a mini ATM, but it is in the premises of another agent. We can help and support that kind of innovation. Funding of those kinds of expansions would help expand the penetration of financial services into districts that do not have any branches. Other innovations rely on cell phones to make payments, pay bills, and receive money or salaries. There are platforms that exist to do this, but the challenges relate to ensuring a certain level of uptake. Our fourth objective is raising awareness, stakeholder engagement, participating in conferences, and bringing people with different ideas, research, and sharing methods together from different countries. Finally, the fifth objective is just about ensuring that the policy and regulatory environment is supportive and facilitates greater financial inclusion. We must engage with policymakers and regulators to continue to develop an enabling environment for financial sector development.</p><h4>How do you envision Mozambique's midterm future?</h4><p>Mozambique is experiencing tremendous growth rates and it is important to make this sustainable. It is important to have a diversified growth strategy, which means expanding businesses in agriculture, tourism, hospitality, services, and providing them with access to finance. If Mozambique is able to provide that balance then the future looks positive. If there is too much focus on megaprojects then it runs the risk of not being able to sustain those growth rates. Already we are feeling the impact that commodity prices are having on Mozambique's investments and GDP. What we need to do is ensure balanced investment because the potential exists in terms of resources, coastline, ports, and agriculture. One must also think about investing in human resources, health, education, and skills enhancement. These are critical to the future of the country. Around 46% of the population is between the ages of 16 and 35, and that is an important market segment, which must be invested in. Working with universities and schools to teach financial topics is important, as is encouraging entrepreneurialism. There is strong opportunity here and I think that we can make a real contribution by trying to find forward thinking partners that want to take the risk to innovate and do things differently.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Baker Hughes came to Ghana in 2008, and its first big contract was in the Jubilee field in 2011 providing oil field chemicals and associated services. What have been the key developments since you entered the market and how have you established yourself as a player here?</h4><p>We were one of the early players in Ghana and we came in with a clear, long-term investment strategy. We began investing in our base at Takoradi. As you can imagine, any investment of that nature needs time for it to pay off. We also focused on building partnerships with customers, and eventually Tullow Oil came on board on the chemicals side of things. We also work with Hess, mainly for developing our footprint in the Ghanaian market. We were involved in Hess's first campaign, working with it on a few projects, mainly on the directional drilling side of things. When Hess came back for the second campaign we continued to work on directional drilling projects with it, and then introduced the wireline side of the business as well. Recently the market has been shifting, and we are trying to get into a partnership with ENI in Sankofa.</p><h4>With low oil prices, companies are trying to reduce spending per barrel. What technologies are you offering to reduce companies' costs and thereby maintain your competitiveness?</h4><p>Baker Hughes is very big on R&amp;D and constantly looking for ways to introduce new products to the market. With oil prices where they are these days, costs are a very important factor in terms of customers keeping projects alive. We continue to introduce new products to customers, sometimes products our clients have never considered. For example, in directional drilling, most companies will drill their wells with conventional tools or with first generation ultrasound drilling tools. We want to introduce a system whereby you can drill that well without the logging-while-drilling (LWD) technologies, so you can drill and log at the same time, eliminating wireline loss. So you save on drilling efficiency time. Our clients are renting rigs, which is a day-by-day cost, so we help save time with this system. That's one of the innovative technologies that we bring to the marketplace. We do the same in chemicals, with a lot of R&amp;D investment going into the chemical products that enhance production for our clients.</p><h4>Do you have any problems with post-water production in Ghana?</h4><p>Some, but not a lot. With the likes of Tullow, we've been injecting a lot of chemicals. Ghana is more likely to develop gas fields than oil fields because it is exploring gas for power. For example, the Sankofa field that ENI is going into right now is just to produce gas for power in Ghana. It plans to drill 15 wells. Drilling will probably take about two years, with production expected in about 42 months. So it's a long-term project. In 2017 there will be another big gas project being initiated as well. With the country's power problems, there's a lot of gas in Ghana at the moment. Therefore, we have a three-pronged approach: improving our footprint in Ghana, developing local capabilities, and developing contact capabilities to provide the right competencies and the right human capacity to serve Ghana's needs, while another key pillar is our partnership with government agencies and GNPC and with their partners as well, because they are key players in this market.</p><h4>You recently met with the Minister for Power and discussed boosting local content. What sorts of initiatives are you considering?</h4><p>We have to develop local Ghanaians, improving their competencies and capabilities. The aim is that more Ghanaians can perform roles that have previously been done by expats. We have been doing our share in terms of hiring and training Ghanaians at Baker Hughes, and we continue to develop local talent and human resources. We've also sent many Ghanaians for additional training and specialization overseas. We'll also start forming joint ventures and partnerships with Ghanaian companies, helping them develop their technical abilities and capabilities. That will help us keep our business alive in Ghana and develop our capabilities in Ghana.</p><h4>Do you expect more joint ventures in the market, and is there any government initiative to push legislation and regulations to enable more partnerships and JVs in Ghana?</h4><p>Yes, I think that will be the way to go—foreign companies teaming up with Ghanaian companies to forge new paths and projects in the oil and gas sector. The government and the Petroleum Commission have also ensured that local content is a requirement for any company wishing to invest and do business in Ghana. A certain amount of money and funds are required to develop, hire, procure, train, and partner with Ghanaians in Ghana. We are already perfectly positioned to abide by these new regulations, having been here a long time and having already done our share in terms of hiring and working with local Ghanaians and developing local capabilities in the company.</p><h4>Baker Hughes is in the process of being acquired by Halliburton. How will that affect your future here?</h4><p>This acquisition and eventual business combination should prove to be positive for the market. These are two companies of about the same size coming together to combine their resources, which will make us the number two or three player on the market once it's completed. Once that happens, of course, we expect the new company will have a new name, since it is an acquisition. And although the Baker Hughes name will be gone, the new company will nevertheless combine the cultures of Halliburton and Baker Hughes, and will have a significant lineage to it, and that will have a very positive impact on the market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016, and where do you see yourself this time next year?</h4><p>The ongoing dispute between Ghana and Ivory Coast is slowing things down in Ghana a bit. We are optimistic that it will be settled and won't lead to a spike in activity in Ghana; that would have a negative impact on business here. A lot of companies are waiting for that issue to be resolved. But a business combination of this nature between Baker Hughes and Halliburton means there will be a lot of new opportunities available to us for growth and expanding into new horizons. We'll be working on the ENI project, and we also expect other projects, which are in the works based on discussions with the GNPC and the Petroleum Commission.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of Linea Uno for Lima?</h4><p>Linea Uno is very important; there are very few capitals that do not have a mass transit system. Lima was lagging behind for a long time—more than 9 to 10 million people in Lima lacked access to a metro network, so it has been a big change for the city. Our main challenge was teaching Lima's citizens how to use a new system of transport with a pre-paid card and metro stations and integrate it into their daily lives. One of the major challenges was to teach users that they could plan their trips in advance and organize their life accordingly and know exactly how long it will take to be get where they want to be. The metro and the new “Cultura Metropolitana" are among the most important factors that have allowed the social development of the city. We want this to be the best transportation system by 2021, and the most modern and secure generator of sustainable development and civic culture in Peru. “Cultura Metropolitana" is part of our contractual obligation to grow and share with our neighborhood boards, as well as transform our stations and trains into spaces of education for citizens.</p><h4>More than 80% of the users of Linea Uno are more than satisfied with the service provided. What factors are behind these achievements?</h4><p>From the beginning of our operations, we have believed in continuous improvement. Investment in technology is an asset. We have been reviewing our processes to encourage people to use automatic machines to top up their transport cards, instead of going to a booth to seek personal assistance. This has been a big change. We have worked with the Ministry of Transportation to increase the number of trains that we have available to improve our service, because the system is currently at full capacity.</p><h4>To what extent have you gone to bring best practices to Peru?</h4><p>Throughout all of these years of service, we have had several executives traveling to various countries in the world, bringing best practices to Peru. We had a strategic partnership with the Metro of Medellí­n and we established a consultancy with it at the beginning of our operations, because it works well with the concept of underground culture. The Metro of Medellí­n is a state company; it has to promote citizenship. We, as private company, have the same target and we believe in sustainable growth and in investing in the development of our city.</p><h4>How much are you investing in human capital?</h4><p>Currently, we have close to 800 people working on the project. We invested a lot in the beginning. In the absence of a metro network, we had to start drivers' training, personal care, and mechanical training. In particular, we are implementing a program of work with students; they can work part time during their studies. We are investing a lot in this project.</p><h4>What are the main targets and goals you aim to achieve by the end of 2016?</h4><p>I would like to see the new fleet of trains implemented. There are lots of people that want to continue traveling with us and cannot because the system has already reached full capacity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecobank is the continent's largest bank, present in 36 African countries, but Nigeria has recently been the center of the bank's attention. What importance does the Nigerian market have among the bank's operations?</h4><p>Nigeria was the second subsidiary of ETI, after Togo, but started business years after Togo. It started as a small niche bank with a strong focus on corporate and investment banking, as well as wealth management. When the Nigerian banks started growing as a result of the commodity boom, it remained a niche player. The founders of ETI always considered Nigeria as an important country and, therefore, it was the second country where they launched their operations. It may interest you to know that the majority of the founding fathers were from Nigeria. Over the years, as banks in Nigeria grew we did not grow in tandem. Our operations in the region grew rapidly, but it did not improve its market share in Nigeria. The target was thereafter set to make the bank one of the top three players in the Nigerian landscape. Nigeria was a dominant economy and was playing an important economic and political role in stabilizing the region, and we were starting to see linkages in trade among all the other African countries. At some point a large presence in Nigeria will finance and better integrate the economies of some of the smaller countries, leveraging on the businesses coming from Nigeria. </p><h4>What results do you expect for the second half of 2015?</h4><p>Our growth last year was mainly from loan growth. We were able to finance good transactions in oil and gas, manufacturing, and other sectors. In 2015, there has been significant slowdown in loan growth as the Central Bank tightened its policies as a result of the oil price. People started to panic as, historically, when we have such a massive drop in oil prices it has created portfolio quality problems in Nigeria. But some of those weaknesses have been corrected by imposing sectoral limits across different sectors. In the past the finance sector was over concentrated on energy, and when that sector took a hit, the absorption capacity to deal with it was limited. Over the years, the Central Bank has managed that risk by diversifying the portfolio to avoid any concentration effect when there is a shock in any particular sector. There is no particular sector that has more than 20% of the loan book. I expect the trend that we saw in 2014 will holdout in the first half of 2015. When we get to the second half of this year, you will begin to see some drop off in some of the forecasts because the effect of the fall in the oil price, tightened liquidity, and the strict foreign exchange regime implemented by the Central Bank. At some point, we may start to see a slight compression of major revenue lines.</p><h4>How have you been leveraging new tools in the banking industry to move your business forward?</h4><p>The nation's strong focus on cashless policy has changed the banking habits of customers, particularly so-called millennials, who do not go into banks at all. They do their banking through alternative channels, the internet, POS, or ATMs. For any bank to be able to grow there must be a developed and functioning channel. You have to have a good internet banking system and mobile money payments. Today, the only reason you see people coming into the branches is to deposit money. For Ecobank, that has helped us to manage the large customer bank that we have—we have over seven million customers. Some of these customers are micro-finance customers and so we need to have a low-cost approach to deal with them, hence the various channels. The next segment that we are looking at is the agent banking system, which the Central Bank has also licensed. We are just waiting for a better roll out program so that we can license agents, whereby people can make cash pull and cash deposits of small values with agents. The telecoms sector, in contrast, has a much broader customer base than we do and we believe that, with mobile money, we should be able to reach out to most of their customers. That problem will be resolved subsequently and that segment will take off and at some point in time we will begin to see more acceptance of new channels by customers who are mobile phone customers. These potential customers are financially literate and can operate a bank account if the rules are clear through the mobile payment system. After oil, the next large foreign exchange earner is remittances. The Central Bank estimates that it this is about $20 billion per year. So clearly you need money services like Western Union and MoneyGram to tap into the pool of revenue coming from Nigerians all over the world. We also have our own money transfer product-rapid transfer system, which allows people from within our network to make domestic and regional transfers. Nigerians in the Ivory Coast, for example, can send money to their relatives here through that platform and vice versa. That platform has helped us to integrate our network within the 36 countries while also supporting the international flows coming into Africa through MoneyGram or Western Union.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2016, most of our economies will remain commodity dependent and thus vulnerable to price movements. In other words, as long as commodity prices remain low, they will depress government revenues. For example, oil revenue is a major aspect and that has come down significantly. There is a lot of adjustment underway, and some state governments are having difficulties funding their expenditure base. Across the African market, growth will slow down a bit, but we still think that 2016, from a banking sector perspective, will hold some decent revenues and profit.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia is chairing ASEAN for 2015. What are Malaysia's unique qualities that have made it a strong chairman and allowed it to develop ASEAN?</h4><p>Malaysia assumed its chairmanship of ASEAN at a challenging phase of the ASEAN's community-building and integration process. This year marks the end of the period for implementation of the 2009-2015 action plans contained in the three blueprints for the political-security, economic, and socio-culture communities. In the remaining months of 2015, ASEAN has been accelerating efforts to realize the ASEAN Community and at the same time crafting its post-2015 vision. This year indeed has been instrumental in deciding the success of the ASEAN Community building process and in charting the future direction of the ASEAN Community. As ASEAN Chair at this critical juncture, Malaysia with its vast experience and the strong support and dedication of its leadership has contributed to the enhancement of ASEAN unity and solidarity helping ASEAN maintain its centrality through the implementation of important initiatives such as those addressing the issues or the irregular movement of people, radicalization and violent extremism, the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the development of SMEs, the strengthening of ASEAN institutions and the promotion of ASEAN as a people-oriented and people-centered community. Malaysia's successful chairmanship of ASEAN this year is laying a solid foundation for ASEAN's further progress in the process of community consolidation and comprehensive integration beyond 2015.</p><h4>How would you summarize the trade benefits that this economic bloc has to offer its AMS?</h4><p>The AEC will increase the opportunities for ASEAN Member States in the form of an increasingly well-regulated, dynamic, and creative platform for trade and commerce. The community is comprised of some of the world's most dynamic economies, and amid the diversity, lies complementary strengths and potential. As a region, ASEAN has become more influential, with widening markets regionally and globally. It is Asia's third largest economy and the world's seventh largest. With a combined population of 625 million, ASEAN has a vast consumer base, behind only China and India. ASEAN is also among the most advanced integrated markets with intra-ASEAN trade comprising the largest share of its total trade that amounted to $2.53 trillion in 2014. One of AEC's pillars is the establishment of a single market and production base. Toward this end, significant progress on tariff liberalization has been made across the region with intra-ASEAN import tariffs virtually eliminated and formal restrictions in services sector gradually removed providing ASEAN Member States with greater market opening and economies of scales in trading and doing business within the region. Member States will also benefit from improved efficiency from lower transaction costs and better business certainty with simplifications of cross-border trading processes, including customs procedures and rules of origin, harmonization of technical regulations and mutual recognition arrangements. The AEC has also led to the creation of a business-friendly and innovation-supporting regional environment through the adoption of common frameworks, standards and mutual cooperation across various areas such as agriculture and financial services, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection. It also supports improvements in transport connectivity and other infrastructure networks that have facilitated cross-border transportation and contributed to reducing overall costs of doing business, while providing ASEAN's people and businesses with better opportunities to work together in a more productive manner. Finally, the coherent approach pursued by ASEAN in its external economic relations in an effort to fully integrate to the global economy will provide ASEAN member states with opportunities to expand their reach in the markets to strategic partner countries, and enhance their participation in global supply networks.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Several experts in the local health sector believe heart disease is among the most common causes of illness in Thailand. Why is this?</h4><p>Heart disease is one of the major health factors influencing mortality and life expectancy in Thailand. There are many reasons for this. Above all is that Thai's are still developing their understanding of a healthy lifestyle, which is proven to ameliorate heart problems. By this, I am referring to eating a healthy diet, participating in sports activities, not smoking, and maintaining a proper bodyweight. These are all issues that are common to many developing countries and not exclusive to Thailand; however, in Thailand, we are still behind on promoting education on these issues, which is where The Heart Association of Thailand comes in.</p><h4>What activities has The Heart Association of Thailand promoted to address the problems of heart disease?</h4><p>Our key responsibility is to focus on prevention through public education jointly with the Heart Foundation of Thailand. Our activities are run through the different working groups and clubs under The Heart Association of Thailand, which all focus on specific issues within heart disease. For example, we oversee the function of the Thai Society of Cardiac Imaging, the Heart Failure Council of Thailand, the Thai Resuscitation Council, The Society of Pediatric Cardiology of Thailand, and the Cardiac Rehabilitation Society of Thailand, among others. These are all subgroups that are represented by some of the leading medical and academic experts on heart disease in Thailand. Supporting these groups and linking their findings to public health policy is the key aim of The Heart Association of Thailand. One of our major successes has been to ensure that medical and surgical treatments of heart disease are covered by the national healthcare policy for all Thai nationals. This is crucial because it means that even when we miss the prevention stage, we are still able to provide access to treatment for everyone.</p><h4>As an association under Royal Patronage, how important has this status been to your achievements?</h4><p>It has been important. Before we were awarded Royal Patronage, people's awareness of heart disease, let alone The Heart Association of Thailand, was low. Then, about 20 years ago, His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej had some heart issues, which were treated at Siriraj Hospital. Since then, he realized the importance of maintaining a healthy heart and a healthy lifestyle; therefore, he decided to promote this issue publically by awarding us with Royal Patronage status. With this royal support, our significance and reputation has increased drastically. It is because of the Royal Patronage that we have been able to coordinate so many specialized working groups and attract leading experts from across the cardiovascular field.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I believe that 2016 will be a game-changer for the local health sector, and indeed our own goal. Primarily, this will be because of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), which will come into effect at the end of the year. The reason why this will be such a vital factor for the health industry is because it will ease the access of patients from neighboring countries to Thailand's health facilities. At present, we have already received a vast number of patients from Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and also from the Middle East. We expect this number to increase significantly. Our strategy, therefore, will be to work intensively on improving healthcare standards along the Thai borders as well as international boundaries. We aim to improve the standards of healthcare and accommodate the surge of medical tourists that we are expecting. Then, Thailand's health sector will not only experience a boom in 2016 and beyond, but also become the medical hub of Asia.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the last 10 years, bilateral trade between Nigeria and South Africa has strengthened enormously, providing an example of the developing force of inter-African partnerships. What initiatives have driven this growth over the last few years?</h4><p>South Africa regards Nigeria as one of its most important partners on the African continent in pursuing the vision of Africa's renewal. In this regard, South Africa views its relationship with Nigeria as an enduring strategic partnership, centered on the advancement of the African agenda. In 1999, South Africa and Nigeria established a structured bilateral mechanism, the Bi-National Commission (BNC). At its inception the primary objective of the partnership was to anchor and strengthen the existing bilateral, historical, political, economic, and social relations between the two countries, which would invariably also benefit other countries on the continent. The BNC further serves to promote trade and investment. The two countries have since signed more than 34 bilateral agreements and MoUs, which are coordinated through the BNC and, in turn, are led by the respective deputy and vice presidents of both countries. With its large population and vast natural resources, especially oil and gas, Nigeria is South Africa's key trading partner on the continent providing significant opportunities for its exports and investments. There are over 100 South African companies doing business in Nigeria in various sectors, mainly telecommunications, banking, retail, property, entertainment, and hospitality. Nigeria is one of the few countries that enjoy a positive trade balance with South Africa.</p><h4>Having reliable and strong leaders on the continent is key to sustainable growth. How does South Africa intend to support good governance in Nigeria?</h4><p>The holding of peaceful elections and the transitional handing-over of power from one leader to another is what South Africa will continue to encourage and support in Nigeria and in Africa in general. South Africa remains steadfast in its opposition to unconstitutional changes of government on the continent and promotes adherence to African Union norms and instruments aimed at strengthening good governance and democracy on the continent, such as the African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance. These are essential measures toward the realization of sustainable peace. It is important that we create an enabling environment for peace to thrive by supporting economic development on the continent. The two countries have an established bilateral mechanism through which all pertinent socio-economic issues affecting both countries are addressed.</p><h4>How can African nations work together to develop a policy response to the new status quo, particularly in terms of regional economic integration?</h4><p>In our view, economic integration encompasses three pillars; market Integration, infrastructure development, and continental industrialization. Continental integration efforts are being intensified through the negotiation of the Tri-Partite Free Trade Agreement. Africa is made up of five economic regional communities and these structures are tasked with negotiating a much closer working relationship that will ultimately lead to an Africa-wide free trade agreement with a potential single market of over 1 billion people. Considerable progress has been made in the negotiations, which aim to integrate 26 countries of eastern and southern Africa. This involves a population of nearly 600 million people and a combined GDP of $1 trillion. This market scale could launch a sizeable part of the continent onto a new developmental trajectory. There is a need to redefine and to strengthen our partnerships on the continent toward realizing the vision of an integrated Africa, underpinned by greater levels of intra-Africa trade and even greater levels of intra-Africa investments. African countries need to trade among themselves and there are good programs through various organs of the African Union aimed at promoting trade amongst Africans within the continent and to promote regional integration.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for investors in African infrastructure?</h4><p>South Africa's imports from Nigeria are comprised of mainly oil and gas. Since 1999, there has been an increase in the number of South Africans multinationals operating in the Nigerian market. Currently, there are estimated to be more than 100 South African companies doing business in Nigeria. The biggest investment by South African companies in Nigeria has been in the telecommunications sector. Statistically, Nigeria is the biggest source of tourists, contributing about 84,589 arrivals into South Africa in 2013. Nigeria alone contributed about 64% of the total tourist arrivals from the West Africa region in 2013. Lack of access to trade-enabling infrastructure on our continent is a fundamental challenge. There is increasing recognition that Africa's integration and intra-Africa trade cannot be realized without concerted efforts to invest in Africa's infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. We have an extensive infrastructure development program championed by the heads of state and government through the Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative. We want to continue building infrastructure such as roads, railways, bridges, dams, and airports to make it easier to travel around the continent. The African heads of states have committed themselves to continue building cross-border infrastructure to unlock growth and development on our continent. In addition to a focus on trade-enabling infrastructure, it is our firm belief that this approach will unlock a large number of investment opportunities on the continent and set us on a prosperous path to growth. On average, Africa has experienced steady economic growth as a bloc over the past decade, a factor that has brought increased attention by other regions.</p><h4>How is South Africa working with Nigeria to improve regional security?</h4><p>Africa has adopted a framework document on Agenda 2063, which is our shared vision of the Africa We Want, containing aspirations of our peoples and governments. We want to work together to find solutions for many of the challenges facing the continent, including security. We are concerned with the escalation of the threat of terrorism on the continent, and especially the ruthless attacks by Boko Haram not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries. However, the collective response from the region is encouraging. In this regard, South Africa supports the five-country regional Multi-National Task Force involving troops from Nigeria, Chad, Niger, Cameroon, and Benin to fight against Boko Haram insurgencies. It is our wish to see the African Union assume its central role in resolving crises to avoid repeating our mistakes. It is therefore important that we strengthen the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA). The most critical part of this architecture is to improve the African Union's preventive diplomacy and its capacity to translate early warning information into early action so as to avert crises from escalating. It is also important that constant attention is given to the countries where interventions have been successful as these countries are at their most vulnerable and have the potential for relapse into conflict. We should therefore strengthen our support for Post Conflict Reconstruction and Development (PCRD) on the continent by mobilizing resources before looking to others, and South Africa and Nigeria have been key in realizing these efforts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the ultimate purpose of your visit to the UAE recently on a business delegation?</h4><p>The ultimate purpose of the visit was to deepen the relationship between our countries. The UAE and Finland already have quite close relationships on commercial and trade matters, but it is now is a good time to learn more about each other; there is such a huge possibility to strengthen our cooperation. I went to learn about the country, what its plans and strategies for the future are, and what people are thinking. This is good timing because the world is changing quite rapidly and in Finland many reforms are taking place, so it is good to get closer so that we really know each other. This will also work to deepen trade relations. In Finland, we have many sectors and lots of expertise that are of considerable interest to public authorities and companies here. We are trying to deepen cooperation in these sectors.</p><h4>HE Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum wants to accelerate the transition to a knowledge economy, based on creativity and innovation. How can Finland help facilitate the process?</h4><p>That's a good question because one word that was used quite a lot during the visit was “innovation." In Finland, we are very much focusing and emphasizing innovation at all levels. It's in our education, in universities, and we had very many young entrepreneurs creating startups during the crises and they built upon modern inventions. At the same time, these SMEs are highly innovative. Finland has a good platform to create innovation because our education is very good, starting from primary schools all the way to universities and we are always trying to think creatively and to make something new.</p><h4>Finland has top education standards. What advice could you give to Dubai regarding education?</h4><p>We have been discussing a lot on education. Finland is very good in that area; we have very good basic training. We have been talking a lot about this training and also new ways to study, including the e-learning, fun learning, and new methods based on ICT. There are interesting ways to use technology in the schools. I hope for more cooperation between our countries. Through education you build a basis for innovation. It's where you plant a seed. The young people and children think creatively. That's how to innovate. This leads to startup enterprises. We have this event called “Slush," which means wet snow. That's in November because that's normally the time of year when we have wet snow in Finland. It's a huge event. Altogether last year 14,000 people were gathered in Helsinki. There were startups, entrepreneurs, and investors. They got connected and it was good. We are inviting investors from the UAE and all over the world to this event in November. This Slush event is kind of a Finnish event we want to spread all over the world. The idea behind this is innovation and for small startups to have a platform to explain what they do. In Finland, we have a very harsh climate so we have to think wisely how we use our natural resources. We have to think very creatively. We want to be energy efficient and use all our resources very sparsely. Also, we want to keep our nature clean. It's very important for Finnish people. We think of the environment first all the time so that we don't spoil it for our children. That's important for Finland. That's the idea for many of the innovations that Finland right now is famous for.</p><h4>How can the UAE and Finland cooperate in areas such as health or clean tech?</h4><p>Clean technology is an excellent example of an area where we can cooperate. During the visit we met a lot of locals and politicians and we discussed topics in this area. The UAE is very much focusing on models and strategies, changing toward renewables, including solar energy and so on. Finland has this kind of high-tech know-how for solar power and also wind power. That is one sector. Also, we have high technology in the waste management area. That's very interesting. Waste management from waste into energy is very interesting. Also, water management is very high technology in Finland. Aside from that, we also have high expertise in healthcare, and this is something that is important in both countries. We have challenges related to diabetes or increasing numbers of cancers or people not exercising enough or eating too much. In Finland, there are a surprising number of new enterprises coming into this sector all the time. Many of these enterprises are now visiting the UAE with very modern technology based on ICT, which is very efficient. There are many technologies that help to prevent cancers or make life easier for those with diabetes and so on. It's an interesting area.</p><h4>What is your long-term vision of relations between the UAE and Finland?</h4><p>We have many common interests, like these health issues, and we are very keen on taking good care of our environment. I think these are the future sectors where we could really do more, as well as education. We are very future-oriented. We are worried about our children and being healthy, environmentally friendly, and so on. These ideas are somehow very similar in our countries. Also, we are wholesome people who take good care of our families. That's why our children are taken care of, as well as our elderly. In these three sectors there are so many possibilities to push ahead with more cooperation because we have the same kinds of visions and goals. Also, it's not just a one-way cooperation. I always see these trade relations as a win-win. We are here to learn. When we work together, we get new innovations. These are the kinds of things that cannot be born in Finland only. When we work together, it's something new. And also maybe that will interest other countries. This area is also a gateway to other countries, like the Middle East, the rest of the GCC, and the greater MENA region. Also, maybe the UAE sees Finland as a gateway to the rest of northern Europe. There is a lot to gain, for both countries.</p><h4>What are your thoughts on the EU-GCC free trade agreement?</h4><p>Finland is a strong supporter of all free trade and free trade agreements. We think it's important for a country like us, a small European country reliant on exports—and I understand the UAE is similar. It would be wise to discuss about how we can start these negotiations again.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Alghanim Industries is one of the largest, privately owned business conglomerates in the Gulf region. What has been the key to building and maintaining long-standing relationships with over 300 of the world's top brands?</h4><p>The key is trust. Our partners trust us, and that means everything. Trust is an invaluable resource in business. In our case, trust is built on a foundation of successful partnership with global industry leaders that spans generations. General Motors (GM) is the principal example of such a partnership; my grandfather Sir Yusuf Alghanim signed a landmark deal with GM in 1945, making our company the first and only authorized GM dealership in the Middle East. The GM partnership continues today. Other examples include Saint Gobain, British Petroleum, and Colgate-Palmolive. In February we launched a new partnership with Wendy's—we will be leading an expansion of the brand in the Middle East and North Africa. We are confident this will be a prosperous and long-lasting relationship.</p><h4>With a 55% market share in its segment in the Gulf and an 80% share of the Kuwaiti market, KIMMCO produces 25,000 metric tons of insulation material a year. How has the company been performing and what opportunities lie ahead for KIMMCO?</h4><p>I look at insulation in a broad way. Insulation represents the best solution and the single most effective way to reduce energy consumption and pollution. In spite of being part of an oil-rich region, many GCC countries are importing gas for power generation. According to a Citigroup report, Saudi Arabia is at risk of becoming an oil importer in the next 20 years. When factoring in per capita energy consumption, and how it's higher than most industrialized nations, the notion becomes that much more believable. Where does insulation come in? Studies show that in Saudi Arabia, for example, buildings consume about 80% of all electricity used in the country. Insulation can reduce energy consumption by 50%, which in turn reduces the size and cost of A/C equipment. The environmental implications are huge. It isn't only about energy saving though; buildings that are insulated have less temperature fluctuation and less noise pollution, which in the end provides you with better customer experience. That's really what it comes down to; less wasted energy and more comfort for the consumer. If we take that, and apply it on a national or macro level, we see a reduction in government spending on power plants, which can be as high as $2 billion per power plant. We see a reduction in CO2 emissions. Today, there are countries that have regulated insulation with these objectives in mind. For 36 years, KIMMCO has been dedicated to providing the best insulation solutions in the region. Our partnership with the French insulation giant, Saint-Gobain, has helped us achieve that goal. Just as important is our dedication to increasing public awareness on the benefits, which stems from our view that it is the single most effective way to reduce energy consumption and pollution. We've achieved a lot over these years. If you've been in the region, you've been in a KIMMCO insulated building; whether you've visited Burj Al Arab or taken a ride on the Dubai metro, you've experienced our insulation. I am also excited about our latest joint venture with Saint-Gobain, SIIMCO, which specializes in the production of stone-wool insulation solutions for all type of buildings. Based out of Yanbu, Saudi Arabia, the new factory will allow us to meet the increasing demand for eco-friendly and energy efficient building materials. When completed, it will have an annual capacity of 60,000 metric tons of stone-wool insulation material. We know that the energy savings for Saudi Arabia will be huge. The factory will officially open in 1Q2016 and will not only cater to Saudi market but regional markets as well.</p><h4>X-cite is Kuwait's biggest consumer electronics chain and maintains the largest market share by far in the country. After opening your first X-cite outlet outside of Kuwait, in Saudi Arabia, what will be your strategy to maintain competitiveness in the Kingdom?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is a huge market with huge potential; before we made our decision to enter we studied not only the market but the Saudi consumers as well. What we realized is that there is room for growth, especially when it comes to customer experience. Thankfully, that's something we do right at X-cite. Our hope and ambition is to provide consumers with a new electronics experience. Our dual philosophies of placing the customer at the center of our business and maintaining that our employees are our core asset provides us with a competitive edge. If you visit our store in Riyadh, you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. We've created a convenient, dynamic, and modern shopping experience that puts us ahead of our competitors. Customers can get their hands on the product, rather than view them through glass displays; it's interactive. Another area we focused on is the online experience, and we're happy to have launched both our brick-and-mortar location and our xcite.com.sa online store at the same time. While we recognize that we might be a few years away from seeing the same e-commerce activity as we might see in developed countries, we believe no offering is complete without this channel. We are fully committed to growing this business in the Kingdom, and are happy to announce the launch of our second store in Riyadh with more on the way.</p><h4>How has Alghanim performed in the automotive business over 2014 and into 2015 and what are your expectations for the automotive business in Kuwait?</h4><p>Our internal analysis of the Kuwaiti vehicle market based on data received from the traffic authorities shows that the market took a breather during 2014 and in fact declined a little. In 2015, the market has declined further with consumers holding back somewhat on purchases of “big ticket" items. However, we are seeing signs of the market stabilizing and are confident of a resumption in growth during 2016. Having said that, we are pleased to see solid improvements in the market share of our brands, Chevrolet and Cadillac, as we launch new models and our teams continue their focus on ensuring the highest levels of customer satisfaction both in the areas of sales and aftersales. Also, we are proud to have opened two new Honda showrooms, a car showroom and a dedicated motorcycle showroom. Honda's customer-centric designs and state-of-the-art service areas will be a welcome addition to the local automotive market.</p><h4>What is your approach to attracting, developing, and retaining local talent at Alghanim Industries and how do you identify the “high potential" candidates from Kuwait and around the Gulf?</h4><p>My main management goal has been to recruit the best talent from the Gulf and beyond and empower them. We hire as many Kuwaiti and Gulf national MBA graduates as we can, both in the region as well as on campuses abroad. If we can't get them straight out of school, we follow them as their careers advance and look for opportunities to recruit them down the line. I am a huge believer in hiring not only Kuwaitis but also Gulf nationals because most of our consumers are in the Gulf. When you have Gulf nationals speaking to Gulf consumers, you're able to come up with value propositions that resonate more effectively. With that in mind we've also created a series of programs targeted at attracting and developing young local talent, including internships and a fresh graduate development program. Over the past summer we hosted over 20 summer interns and gave them challenging projects that provided practical knowledge, built confidence, and provided interaction with our senior management team. We have a dozen recent graduates in our Alghanim Future Leaders Program, which is a nine-month development program that provides classroom training and rotational assignments. We support all of these programs by taking time to recognize and reward the achievements of the participants, which increases employee engagement and ultimately retention. Of course there is a higher purpose with all this. We want to contribute to the development of a thriving private sector in Kuwait and the GCC. Kuwait's government employs more than 90% of the nation's workforce, which is typical in the GCC. Compare that to the US, where public employment represents about 14% of the workforce. That's an impediment to growth and unsustainable over time. Public employment lacks the incentives that drive innovation and productivity in the private sector. And such massive bureaucracy can dampen economic and social development. It is for this reason that I became a founding and board member of INJAZ-AL ARAB, as well as the Chairman of INJAZ-Kuwait, which are part of the international non-profit NGO Junior Achievement. My interest in empowering youth, particularly through teaching entrepreneurship, stems from the critical issue of youth unemployment. In the MENA region, 60% of the population is under the age of 25. Of these young people under age 25, a staggering one out of every four is unemployed. In some MENA countries, youth unemployment is as high as 40%. Private sector employment has got to grow—swiftly, broadly, and sustainably—in Kuwait and throughout the Middle East. Our economies must be more diversified. Young people must have more choices about the kinds of careers they have. We have to promote more entrepreneurialism in the region.</p><h4>When it comes to growth opportunities, in what particular sectors and markets are you looking to expand Alghanim Industries' portfolio within the Gulf and abroad?</h4><p>I'll start by saying we are planning to expand strategically in the years ahead, focused above all on the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Our best opportunities lie in these emerging and frontier markets, and here in the region where we have long operated at the crossroads of East-West trade. As far as sectors are concerned, consumer electronics, retail, and the food and beverage industries are areas of focus. We discussed our electronics chain X-cite, which opened its first overseas store in Riyadh this year. Then there is our partnership with the Wendy's Company to expand the Wendy's brand across the MENA region. This partnership includes all Wendy's outlets in the UAE, which will serve as a good foundation for growth. Similarly in 2013 we acquired the Costa Coffee brand in Kuwait. The brand had not had a ton of success here, but we invested in top-tier locations and revamped the menu and are seeing a turnaround. We are also planning on increasing the range of products for Kirby Building Systems, which is a pre-engineered building manufacturer we acquired in the 1970s. And we see huge potential for our insulation manufacturers, which include KIMMCO here in Kuwait, SIIMCO in Saudi Arabia, Izocam in Turkey, and Rockwool India. Improving insulation is the single most effective thing a building owner can do to reduce energy use and pollution. We are pleased with the performance of our businesses but are in continuous evaluation mode. To run a diversified company you have to make trade-offs. You can't do everything; that's a failing strategy. You look at your businesses with a critical eye and when you decide you can do better in one area than another, you act decisively.</p><h4>How do you view the importance of Kuwait's role on the global stage?</h4><p>We play an important role on the global stage for several reasons. First, Kuwait is at the crossroads of East and West. We have a proud history as a nation of merchants, plying our trade across borders and building lasting, useful enterprises that play a role in the progress of their time and place. This role puts us in a strong position to contribute to regional economic prosperity. Second, Kuwait has 10% of the world's oil reserves. This gives us outsized power and influence relative to other countries of our size. Third, and most importantly, Kuwait is a myth-shattering example to the world of sectarian cooperation and tolerance. This discussion takes me outside my role as a regional business leader, but the issue is important to address. The 2015 mosque attack is among Kuwait's darkest, but proudest, moments. It reminds us that in Kuwait, national unity and shared history transcend religious difference. As such we are an example for the region.</p><h4>How can Kuwait become more competitive regionally and globally, and what issues do you believe will define Kuwait's economic future in the coming years?</h4><p>Kuwait has some noteworthy strengths and weaknesses. On balance our economic prospects are bright. On the strengths, we have solid leadership and guidance under the Emir, His Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. We have a world-class banking sector and governance system that puts us in a strong position to benefit from regional growth. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) has done a superb job of partnering with the financial services industry to implement the post-2008 regulatory framework. I have observed this first-hand in my role as Chairman of Gulf Bank. It's worth noting here because our banking system is the foundation upon which all our economic activity is built. I can't overstate the importance of CBK's leadership to Kuwait's economic climate. On the weaknesses, we face difficulties in engaging Kuwaiti youth in the private sector. It is difficult to persuade people in Kuwait to give up the certainty and security of government employment, where few people if any lose their jobs, for the greater rewards, greater risks, and harder work in the private sector. I believe we can do more to reform public education. In too many instances, education in the Middle East has emphasized memorization over critical thinking. Generations upon generations have been trained to use their minds to store knowledge rather than to apply knowledge to solving problems. We have to change that emphasis. Then there is the question of diversity, especially when it comes to women in the workforce as a key factor in competitiveness. The MENA gender gap is three times what exists in most developing economies. According to the IMF, if this gap were narrowed by just one-third the regional GDP would grow by 6% or $1 trillion. This is a massive source of potential growth we need to unlock. It is easy for the private sector to stand on the sideline and point out problems. We have a responsibility to be part of the solution, working hand-in-hand with the government to encourage this critical transition from past practices. I take this responsibility very seriously. It's the reason I am involved with the WEF at a regional level as well as INJAZ, which encourages entrepreneurship. Research from International Labor Organization (ILO) indicates that entrepreneurs are most successful when exposed to entrepreneurism in primary, secondary, and university levels. This is precisely the reason I founded INJAZ. We need to be involved with governments to help develop and implement policies that will help young people acquire the skills they need to compete in the global economy, and provide the entrepreneurial talent the region needs to thrive in the future. I am excited to see Kuwait setup the National Fund for Development of SMEs to support entrepreneurism. This KWD2 billion fund aims to grow the entrepreneurial ecosystem by providing different forms of support to SMEs. As Chairman of Gulf Bank, I'm proud to say that we are the first bank to participate in this program, which involves leveraging our existing financial infrastructure and expertise to assist in providing growth capital, in the form of debt.</p><h4>Moving forward, how do you see the future?</h4><p>We will challenge ourselves, as we always have, to innovate and grow. As I see it, and this goes way beyond 2016, I have an obligation, just as my father and grandfather had, to succeed in making the future of our company better than the past. I owe that to my family, to the 14,000 men and women who work in Alghanim Industries, and to the customers who depend on us. I have an obligation as well to Kuwait, to the GCC, and to the greater Middle East to use our success and the lessons of our success to benefit the peoples of the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dangote Cement's profits rose 28% in 1H2015 despite a weakening macro-environment. What drove those strong results?</h4><p>The collapse in oil prices, the devaluation of the naira, the uncertainties around the last national elections, the continuing insurgency in the North East, disruptions in petroleum products supplies, and continued import dependence of the economy for many basic necessities have all negatively impacted consumer spending power and behaviour. This led to a decrease in sales volumes in our home market. Despite all the above challenges, our strong results can be attributed mainly to the increased diversity of our business. Our cement sales volume increased by 13.7% YoY, with 22% of the volumes sold coming from Senegal &amp; Cameroon (West and Central Africa Region) and Sephaku Cement, Ethiopia, and Zambia (South and East Africa Region). Our strategy has been to enter new markets with a higher-quality product produced at lower-cost factories, and as a result we are rapidly gaining market shares in key African markets, in spite of well-established competition. Nevertheless, despite the reduction in volume sales in Nigeria, revenue from our Nigerian operations rose by 2.7%. This was due in large part to an increase in average selling prices (about 11%), and improvements in the energy mix.</p><h4>One of Dangote's most important projects—Nigeria's first full-scale privately owned domestic refinery—just received a near $1 billion dollar grant from the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for the development of human resources. How will this project change the economic status quo in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria's economy is heavily dependent on oil revenues, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuating crude oil prices. Nigeria is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of crude oil yet, due to our low refinery utilization rate, we are one of the largest importers of refined petroleum products. This opportunity and challenge was a major driver in my decision to embark on the $9 billion, 650,000 bpd refinery project. The generous grant from USTDA will provide essential training of the critical human capital needed for this extremely technical project, particularly given that this has previously been a largely inactive sector with little to no opportunities to build up the necessary practical skills. The project will eliminate Nigeria's dependence on foreign refined petroleum products and therefore reduce costs of all goods and services. The government subsidy on imported petroleum products is under review and is unsustainable in the longer term. Resources freed up from this expense will ensure that more export revenues are used in country to fund government projects like infrastructure, power, and education.</p><h4>What impact do you expect the recent investments in the opening and expansion of cement plants in Cameroon and Tanzania will have on the company's future prospects?</h4><p>By the time all these investments become operational in the next few years, we will be present in 16 other countries outside of Nigeria, and have a total capacity of 81 million metric tons per annum. This will make us the largest cement company in Africa, making the Dangote Group a truly pan-African company. The expansion will definitely have tremendous impact on our future prospects, which we believe will be a positive. It will diversify our earnings streams—already 40% of the group's revenues are from outside Nigeria. This diversity provides a hedge, making it easier to obtain financing. The expansion will also pave ways for entry into other countries, which creates opportunity for expansion into other sectors and increases our brand recognition.</p><h4>What makes the current environment promising despite difficult macroeconomic conditions? </h4><p>Despite the challenges, now is a great time to invest in Nigeria, and indeed much of Africa. The slowdown in global commodities demand has deflated a number of the bubbles in the markets. Such challenges stimulate creativity, evolution, and innovation in a competitively priced environment. Conversely, the growing demands from a young, urbanizing population is only now taking off and is projected to continue to outpace the rest of the world over the next generation. The current macroeconomic conditions surrounding investments in Africa are not favourable for short-term investors and speculators today, and this is a good thing in the long term. As a long-term investor, one would be remiss not to see the mid-to-long term opportunity in investing in Africa to add value to raw materials for domestic processing and export.</p><h4>How are plans progressing to list Dangote Cement on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, and what impact do expect it to have on the company's operations?</h4><p>A listing on either the LSE or the JSE, or both, remains a vital component of our vision for DCP. These listings will potentially fund further growth from a pan-African firm to a truly global cement powerhouse as they could allow us to continue to raise capital from new, deeper sources at more competitive rates. Shares on the JSE and LSE are traded by a wide array of institutional and professional investors that would further diversify our existing investor base. In addition, western individual and institutional investors are continuously looking for ways to engage in the African consumer growth story, from which we have benefited greatly. These listings would allow for that broader participation and would drive awareness to the global public about our firm and what we have built thus far. However, when it comes to public exchange listings, timing is of the utmost importance, regardless of the strength of a firm's fundamentals. Thus, given the negative sentiment around and the perceived risk of investing in Nigeria and Africa today, we are not in a hurry to go to market just yet.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>It is difficult to predict what will happen in the coming year, given the fluid nature of regional and global developments. But, projections for 2016 from various sources suggest that the global economy will rebound slightly next year after the slow-down experienced in 2015. Across Africa, a number of countries like Nigeria and Zambia, which are historically resource dependent, will likely continue to face the after-effects of lower commodity prices. In my opinion, these challenges present a perfect opportunity for governments and private sector players to start diversifying and reorienting their respective economies and implementing structural reforms. At the Dangote Group, we have always taken a stance that rather than waiting to see what will happen in the future or resigning our fate to expectations, we capitalize on market uncertainties to make game-changing investments as we have done in cement and are planning to do in the oil and gas sector (through our refinery) and agri-business (through our investments in rice and fertilizer).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the economic performance of Peru in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Peru's development stems from certain factors. In the past we had a period of high inflation, strong devaluation, fiscal deficit, a dearth of foreign reserves, a balance of payment deficit, and very unstable macroeconomic figures. It was very difficult to predict what was going to happen. The country was characterized as a closed economy. In the 1970s the government owned almost every major productive activity, and there was a lot of protectionism, which led to consumers experiencing high prices and a lack of quality. In the 1990s the government began to change these conditions, introducing a stronger emphasis on stabilizing the economy. Secondly, it began to open up the economy. After that process began, no matter what government was in power, policies were stable and all the governments since that time have tried to maintain good macroeconomic indicators. Today, inflation is low compared to the rest of the world, especially compared with neighboring countries, and has stood at between 2 and 3%. Today, Peru has an open economy, with the opportunity of choosing between domestic or foreign goods. This has improved not only the quality of life for the consumers, but also the productivity of the country. The producer has the opportunity to import capital goods, technology, raw materials, and other inputs, to add value and export to the rest of the world in a competitive way. Over the past 30 years, Peru has started competing with other countries and exporting, which was not possible in the past. It is also interesting that, with the opening up of the economy, Peru started signing trade agreements with several countries, beginning with a free trade agreement with the US. After that, it signed agreements with Canada and the EU, EFTA, China, and more. I would say that 85% of Peruvian trade is covered by free trade agreements. Now it is part of the Pacific Alliance, which is a great initiative, and also the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and APEC.</p><h4>Main indicators show that Peru is an open and reliable country for doing business. How is AmCham Peru positioned to support and foster investment in the country?</h4><p>The consequence of macroeconomic stability and the openness of the economy has been predictability, which has been important for trade and investment. AmCham Peru has 5,000 representatives from 580 companies from all over the world, 30% from the US. For the Chamber, all companies operating in Peru are Peruvian companies. Some have US capital, others Peruvian capital, but all of them share the same environment, the same stakeholders, the same problems and benefits, and the same overall situation. They share good practices and experiences at the AmCham and we work with them toward the solution of some common issues. First of all we foster trade and investment, and we try to defend the interests of our members. In that sense, during the process of the negotiation of the first free trade agreement, we realized 18 missions to the US Congress and visited 351 Congressmen, Senators, and Representatives. On every trip, we took with us the general managers of US companies operating in Peru to visit their representatives and they let them know that the TLC was good for the US, for Peru, and for companies operating in Peru, American or Peruvian. The information that we brought with us was related to the import requirements or potential exports of their state, as well details on their companies that were operating in Peru in order to demonstrate that both parties could benefit. Today, we undertake about nine to 10 missions to fairs in the US, helping SMEs because, sometimes, they do not have the right knowledge regarding visas, customs, or language capabilities to set up appointments with potential buyers. In that respect, AmCham Peru is happy to help. AmCham Peru also receives missions from the US, covering all the segments of the economy.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that companies and investors face when they decide to do business in Peru?</h4><p>The main challenge is to learn the country, the culture, and the availability of good or services. You do not usually engage in business immediately when you go to a country. The first step is getting to know the potential partners. The second challenge is to improve the institutions and to reduce the bureaucratic procedures, help businesses, investors, producers, and consumers. We have to make things easier. Third, we still lack a lot of infrastructure—Peru clearly needs more airports, ports, and roads. The country has developed greatly over the past 20 years, with an expanding middle class and reduced levels of poverty. However, as the country grows, it also needs better infrastructure, institutions, services, and qualified people. In summary, the country has developed, but still faces a long process with many challenges. It still has to fight to reduce poverty even further, but with stability and openness of the economy, we will be able to attract investment and create more jobs. It is a difficult process, but the results will be rewarding. The country has to continue doing the right things. Sometimes, politicians forget that the best way to fight poverty is by attracting investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[beyond-the-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has 2015 been for La Santé and how do you expect to close the year?</h4><p>The company has done very well in 2015. We are focusing on three businesses: prescription, generics, and manufacturing. The generic business is doing well because we are developing our business beyond the market—while the market is growing by 9%, our business is growing by 11%. Around 70% of our sales are concentrated on our unbranded generic business. The manufacturing facility Pharmetique was bought from the German company Boehringer Ingelheim.</p><h4>You mentioned that you are performing better than your competitors. Why is that?</h4><p>We have launched two new products and these are doing well. La Santé also increased its market share in distribution, which is very fragmented in Colombia. We implemented some strategies to improve our distribution, especially on the wholesale level. Colombia has around 13,400 pharmacies and now La Santé is doing well in this channel, which is a big part of our success this year.</p><h4>What manufacturing and distribution facilities do you have?</h4><p>La Santé has five manufacturing facilities, four here in Bogotá and one in Caracas. We have two distribution centers, one in Valencia and one in Bogotá.</p><h4>You bought the company Pharmetique in 2013. How has this purchase strengthened the global position of the company?</h4><p>The strategy of the multinational research companies is concentrated in specialty products. We have good potential for primary care products because the R&amp;D companies are concentrated in high biotech products. The traditional products lose their patents and then companies like ours see an opportunity in those areas. La Santé is launching innovative branded generics and this is why we are successful.</p><h4>Last year President Santos passed a law that allows the manufacturing and selling of biosimilars in Colombia. Will you be involved in this market?</h4><p>We plan to launch biosimilars in the future. La Santé will be involved in this segment, and we are going to launch those products, especially in the oncology and arthritis market. We expect those products to be launched in 2017.</p><h4>Can you give more details on the recent development of your business in Morocco?</h4><p>Part of our strategy is to launch our branded generic products in Africa and the Middle East; in some cases we have a combination of different products. We now have some distributors in the French speaking countries Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Senegal, and we plan to partner with local distributors to launch our branded generic products. After that we plan to launch in English speaking countries like Nigeria and Kenya. Africa is a big opportunity for us because access to medicines is improving and part of the strategy of development is to improve the health of the population. That is why the branded generic products present a great opportunity to increase access.</p><h4>Can you explain your plans for further development in Mexico?</h4><p>In Mexico we plan to partner with local companies. We are conducting clinical trials in Mexico and this is very interesting. To launch and register a branded generic product in Mexico you need to conduct Phase III human clinical trials in the country.</p><h4>Innovation is very important to the company. To what degree has this been a key factor in expanding into foreign markets?</h4><p>We develop six combination branded generics here in Colombia and those products are very successful. We have one patent here and those products were part of our innovation center here in Bogotá. The idea is to launch those products in markets like Mexico, Ecuador, and Peru.</p><h4>The market is expected to grow by 7%. What is your outlook for the Colombian pharmaceutical industry for the coming years?</h4><p>According to some forecasts the market will continue to increase by 7-8%. It is important to mention that as opposed other countries, 90% of the population in Colombia has access to healthcare. 50% of the market is retail and 50% is institutional. This is very different for Latin America, where 30% institutional is normally the case. Both segments will increase in the future by 7-8%.</p><h4>What factors are driving this growth?</h4><p>The government changed the law years ago and part of its strategy is to provide healthcare to the whole population. Colombia is one of the most important models in health worldwide.</p><h4>La Santé is a Colombian company. How attractive is Colombia to manufacture products and export them across the globe?</h4><p>We are in a very good position to export. We are closing some contracts with big multinational companies and are now producing for the companies and exporting across many markets in Latin America. We plan to export to Africa, the Middle East, and Asia from this facility. In this regard, the devaluation is helping, but on the other hand it is impacting our cost because 70% of the raw materials in the pharmaceutical industry are imported. For local production, there has been an impact on costs but for exports the devaluation has been positive for us. Overall it has had a 50-50 impact on us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you see for LNG in Thailand's future energy security?</h4><p>Today, Thailand imports LNG and LPG. LPG is used in every sector and every part of Thailand, be it households, transportation, or industrial use, and demand for LPG is increasing throughout the country, even though it's not increasing at the same rate as before.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you begin your term as the Mayor of Almaty, what do you identify as the biggest challenges facing the city and how do you plan to overcome them?</h4><p>We recently published the Almaty 2020 City Development Program, which is one of the first regional development programs to be openly discussed. President Nursultan Nazarbayev has declared five institutional reforms, which involve 100 concrete steps aimed at bringing Kazakhstan into compliance with OECD standards. Furthermore, in line with the Kazakhstan 2050 strategy, we aim to be among the 30 most efficient countries in the world. That means the whole economy and the mentality of our people has to be reoriented and refocused according to the new standards. Some people claim that this plan is too ambitious, but when you look back at the founding of Kazakhstan 24 years ago, we had a GDP per capita of $600. Since then, we have grown tremendously, which is why this is a realistic target. Our President's strategy for success is simple: economics first, then politics. His priority has always been to create a liberal market economy and to have peaceful relations with all countries, and he worked hard to welcome new cadres and personnel who were flexible enough to accept new challenges and new ways of thinking so as to achieve these goals. When people ask what the key to Kazakhstan's miracle was, I always refer back to 1995 when the President adopted a legislative package of 137 new laws. He brought younger, more open, more flexible people into government who understood and accepted his vision and these sweeping changes, and helped implement them. That was how Kazakhstan's new economy came about. Now, we are instituting a second stage of reforms. These are institutional reforms, in fact they will lead to the creation of whole new institutions, and they are quality-based reforms as well. There are five institutional reforms that are part of this package. The first reform envisions a new model for the civil service, one that is more responsible and more transparent, is client-oriented, and abides by the supremacy of law; the second brings changes to the judicial system; the third, diversification of the economy; the fourth, new patriotism; and the fifth, open and transparent government and a responsible and active civil society. We created a national commission to pursue the implementation of these reforms, and a whole package of new legislation is on the way. All of these reform processes have a direct connection to Almaty. Almaty is a liberal city, a city of NGOs, businesses, and active citizenship.</p><h4>How important is Almaty to the whole of Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The city accounts for 20% of the country's total GDP, and considering the drop in oil prices, now almost 30% of the national income comes from Almaty. Almost 40% of all trading, credits, and deposits, basically all finances, are done in Almaty; 90% of the headquarters of all financial institutions in Kazakhstan are located in Almaty; 15% of SMEs are located here, accounting for half the city's income. Almaty is quite sustainable because SMEs are very flexible, they can adjust to new challenges, they create new job and innovation opportunities, and they can find new niches for new businesses. Around 35% of all businesses in Almaty are in the service sector, including finance and tourism, so it's a service-oriented city and is in that sense quite sustainable. The average age of the city's 1.6 million people is 37, so it is quite young and also represents a large internal market within Kazakhstan, which attracts many opportunities and businesses. Furthermore, one out of every three students in Kazakhstan studies in Almaty. By the end of last year, gross regional product (GRP) per capita in Almaty was $29,000, which means we are talking about a high purchasing power and quality of life, as well as higher living standards.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of the Almaty 2020 City Development Program?</h4><p>We did a deep analysis jointly with McKinsey &amp; Company and the development report was written by the Almaty Development Center, a special company for development strategy, and the report identified seven priorities in terms of city development. We studied the mayors of the most successful cities and what their policies have been, and we came to the conclusion that there are three key factors underlying the successful and sustainable development of any city. The first factor is rational development. This involves a golden triangle, a careful balance between economic development, environment, and social development. Any city has to give more space to business development, but businesses in many cases can act irrationally or irresponsibly. You must create a space for livable conditions for the average citizen and take into consideration the public opinion as much as business opinion. That is also in the interest of the business community, as it provides an environment for their leisure and relaxation needs. This means you have to consider sustainability and environmental protection at the same time, and that is what underlies the careful balance between those three factors. The second factor we saw from studying successful cities and mayors was the importance of public funding and financing efficiency, so the key idea is to generate better goods with fewer expenses. The third factor is creating a cohesive and strong community that will be the foundation of a successful city. Therefore, we will involve the city community and active citizens in making significant decisions regarding our city and to better our environment. We are also actively using PPP mechanisms. We aim to attract three to four tenges of private capital for every tenge spent. We did a great job with McKinsey &amp; Company, having done all the calculations and formulas that will enable us to realize our vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Nacala International Airport project for Odebrecht, and for Mozambique?</h4><p>For Odebrecht, the construction of the Nacala International Airport is an important landmark for our operations in this country and it represents to date our main public project developed for the Mozambican government. Nacala has a strategic geographic position in the north of the country, with high development potential given its gas reserves. In fact, Nacala is one of the closest points to Asia in Eastern Africa and, as a result, the airport finds itself on a key international trade route. Also, the coal extracted from the Moatize mine in Tete is mainly shipped out of Mozambique via the Nacala railway and the city's port. Additionally, Nacala offers a special economic zone with high potential to increase the development of the region. Taking all this in consideration, the airport was developed so as to handle up to 500,000 passengers and 5,000 tons of cargo per annum. As such, it is set to establish itself as a natural gateway and multimodal hub for Africa. This was the first project developed in Mozambique with Brazilian funding, via the Brazilian Development Bank, which we understand was very important in order to consolidate the historical and economical relationship between the two countries. In this project, we also had the opportunity to train local employees, who are fundamental for the growth of our operations in the country.</p><h4>What challenges is the Mozambican civil construction sector facing currently?</h4><p>In my understanding, the costs related to logistics are one of the main challenges. We expect that with the investments expected in the gas sector, Mozambique will develop better infrastructure, particularly roads and ports. Certainly, this shall contribute to reducing the costs of logistics. Skilled local employees is another challenge, especially in the construction sector, and represents a relevant constraint. However, it is also the responsibility of the construction companies to train these people, which obviously represents an additional cost. On the other side, in our vision, it is an investment in people, and one that we make in every country we operate in. As such, maybe more particularly so in Nacala—and also in the coal mine project of Moatize—we had very positive results. Note that roughly 90% of our workforce was made up of local employees. We find another important challenge in the materials and equipment space. As a matter of fact, most of the goods that we use have to be imported, which represents a big burden in terms of costs. Lastly, financing is also a big challenge and the capacity to offer different financial structures and solutions such as project finance and PPPs needs to be boosted.</p><h4>What activities is Odebrecht undertaking in the agroindustrial sector?</h4><p>Agriculture is a fundamental sector for the development of the country, and one of the main priorities of the government is to significantly reduce poverty, increase food security, and improve the quality of life of the population at large and foster the diversification of the economy. Taking this into account, we are developing two projects in this area in Mozambique, (i) a poultry production project, to be implemented in the Zambezia province, in the north, and (ii) a cassava project, in the Gaza province, in the south of the country. All in all, the required investment for both projects is estimated to be around $85 million. Both are in the final stages of their feasibility studies, and our expectation is to launch at least one of them in 2016. An important social component for the sustainable growth of these projects is the integration in the production process of small and medium-sized local producers. The poultry project, for example, will include all production phases, ranging from agricultural production through to the manufacturing of soybeans, its transformation into poultry food, chicken farming, the construction of a slaughterhouse, and commercialization in terms of consumers. </p><h4>How does Odebrecht approach social responsibility in Mozambique?</h4><p>We take social responsibility seriously, and I cannot envisage a situation where Odebrecht develops project without considering its impacts on the local communities and on the environment. In Mozambique, we have been developing a series of social initiatives such as agricultural family programs, focused on female empowerment and the youth, with the aim of promoting the generation of income and also improving the quality of life of the local communities living in the areas where we develop our projects, in line with government priorities. We believe that a country can only grow if its people grow as well; this is the main reason why we focus so much on training and education and we do it because we are committed to the country's development. Just to mention an example, this year in Panama we were hired to develop two projects. One relates to the construction of the second metro line in the capital and the second for the urban rehabilitation of Colon. The community of Colon requested that Odebrecht should be the company to execute the project, in recognition of our experience and of our capacity not only to deliver but also work alongside the local communities. This is as important a result to us as the financial one, and shows that our operations are truly sustainable. </p><h4>Looking to the future, which sectors are most attractive for Odebrecht?</h4><p>Water, energy, and infrastructure are the most attractive areas for us. More specifically, infrastructure and opportunities related to the supply chain for the oil and gas industry. Currently, we have a few other companies of the Odebrecht Group that are evaluating on the ground opportunities in these areas. For example, Braskem, our petrochemical company, which is the largest petrochemical company in the Americas, one of the five biggest in the world, and the first producer of biopolymers, is evaluating a set of opportunities in the petrochemical sector. Last but not least, in the infrastructure sector, we are set to begin the construction of the Maputo Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project in the first semester of 2016, a 17-km corridor, with dedicated lanes for 60 buses, including all operational and technological and security systems. This project will generate around 1,500 direct jobs and it will contribute to the improvement of Maputo's public transportation system.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last October, an MoU was signed between Estonia and Dubai on smart government. How do you assess the evolution of bilateral relations with Dubai?</h4><p>The signing of an MoU on ICT and smart city collaboration is a major step forward for relations between Dubai and Estonia, although we have had cordial relations with the UAE for quite some time, paved by various agreements between our governments. The new MoU is still a big step on a longer path. It lays the foundations, signals the will, and opens the door to practical collaboration between not only our government agencies, but also Emirati and Estonian companies and investors. Although the MoU and our current collaboration initiatives deal with digital economy and government, there is clearly potential for more as we discussed with HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, during our meeting. Estonia can offer a hassle-free business environment gateway to Nordic, European, and even Russian markets for Emirati companies and investors. From our end, our tech, wood, food, and defense industries could have potential new clients in Dubai and the rest of the GCC region. The focus and core interest for collaboration will be in the digital government sphere first and foremost; that is where we know each other best and is where we have the biggest symbiosis. Dubai has a very ambitious smart city development program. It would be our honor to offer our know-how from 15 years of building the digital government in Estonia and being a globally renowned pioneer on this front. Our companies are also more than willing to offer the state-of-the-art digital solutions that they have built for our government or for governments from different parts of the world for use in this setting.</p><h4>In what areas could Dubai's expertise be of interest to Estonia?</h4><p>One example is the way that digital services work on mobile platforms in Dubai. The Dubai Now app is a perfect example of usability and service-orientation combined. How it is designed and how different services and agencies are brought together to offer the best user-experience really captured my attention while in Dubai. More generally, we would like to set up a regular dialogue and keep up with policy and strategy and also new solutions as they emerge in Dubai.</p><h4>What is your outlook for future cooperation between Estonia and the UAE?</h4><p>Upon my recent visit to Dubai I clearly found that we are much more similar than you would think, given also our slight geographic distance. Both of our governments and people are ambitious and willing to take risks for development, and both of us want to rely on technology to make developmental leaps. We are both very pro-business, encouraging trade and investment. As such, there is lots of common ground for a mutually beneficial exchange of know-how and practices. At the same time, as both Dubai and Estonia are small, we need partners to go out into the wider world. Dubai could be a bridge for Estonian companies to enter the GCC, as well as South Asian markets. Estonia can offer the same in the Nordic countries and EU for Dubai and its companies. Most importantly, our private sectors could work together to leverage this potential. Finally, we are keen to see us innovate the future together. We are keen to collaborate on trying some of our key digital solutions in Dubai, in a smart city setting. As an outcome, we can perhaps build new or improved solutions that we can then offer jointly to the wider world as a world class, or even world standard, solution.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Moçambique Previdente received a prestigious award in London for the Best New Pension Fund Management Company in Mozambique for 2014. What factors led to this success?</h4><p>We are the first pension fund company in Mozambique and we started a new business with different processes and a new way of thinking. We apply our expertise in terms of technical capabilities, marketing, and human resources, and have gained a high profile. The Global Banking &amp; Finance Review commended us due to our professional conduct. Our new marketing and communication strategies are expected to expand the size of our portfolio. We started with three pension funds of around $1.4 million and then doubled that amount within a year. Among the companies doing pension funds in Mozambique, there is no ranking available. The statistics are hard to come across, but we know for sure that we are at the forefront and we have the largest market share. In 2015, we want to not only be the Best New Pension Fund Management Company in Mozambique, but the Best Pension Fund Management Company in Mozambique.</p><h4>Moçambique Previdente has invested over $1 million in infrastructure and training. What was the strategy behind this decision?</h4><p>There is a lack of financial education and understanding of what the basic concept of saving is in this country. Not only did we have to train our own staff, but we also have the entire infrastructure to develop. We are required by law to have our service and our IT infrastructure in-country, and we did this from the outset. Fortunately, our partners and shareholders agreed that investing this amount was the best way forward. We started small in terms of infrastructure but we immediately started catering to bigger businesses as well. We started with only three funds but already we have five funds and recently closed the CFM fund. We created this CFM fund and are due to finalize it, hopefully by managing an increase in our staff as well. There are other companies that we are on the verge of closing contracts with. This means that we will be ending 2015 with six clients. We are increasing our staff by another five people, which means we will also have to increase training. The investment in infrastructure and training is a never-ending process. We are starting small but we want to be able to cater for bigger opportunities in the future. </p><h4>What are the biggest challenges that Moçambique Previdente is facing at the moment?</h4><p>One of the issues that we are facing is a lack of understanding about saving. We have a national social security scheme and our pension funds are complementary and essentially voluntary schemes. Some people do not understand what this is or lack the required financial understanding. The other issue is that the country lacks investment. Our stock exchange only has five companies right now, so there are not a lot of opportunities for sourcing funding. Aside from the real estate sector, there are not a lot of instruments for in-country investment. These will ultimately hinder the profitability of the funds. We try to seek out alternative ways of putting fund money into safe investments with good returns.</p><h4>What are the highlights of the benefit system Moçambique Previdente has instituted?</h4><p>We basically understand what a client wants, what they need, and what they are doing, and we create a tailored pension fund for their system. We are working with final contribution funds and final benefit funds and, in some cases, we are actually creating hybrid funds with added benefits. We include risk benefits such as funeral coverage, group life insurance, life insurance, disability, and death.</p><h4>In practical terms, how are you aligning your operations with government initiatives to further develop the Mozambican economy?</h4><p>One of the things about being a complementary pension fund is that we deal with people wanting more than what the INSS offers. They often look to us for an alternative solution. Our service provides added coverage compared to what the INSS is doing. The government wants to provide social welfare and benefits to people in the formal sector. We are also trying to increase the number of funds and increase asset value. We have to bring profits to the funds we serve and, in a way, we have to see where the government strategy is going.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>For 2015, we are trying to provide solutions for the formal sector, such as establishing pension funds as well as providing unique products for individuals. These are our biggest aspirations for this year. We want to consolidate in terms of our investment portfolio and want to venture into real estate, not only because it dictates the growth of the country, but also because it is also a profitable market. We are also trying to provide solutions for SMEs, and are working to this end with a network called REDE PME. We are not only providing pension funds and social welfare to their members, but on the investment side we are looking to see how we can invest more in SMEs. We do not have a stock exchange that it very active itself, but we can invest part of our funds in their venture capital and in new businesses.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the reason behind the recent change of name of MBS?</h4><p>The UK campus-based business school has been renamed Alliance Manchester Business School following the generous and substantial donation by Lord Alliance of Manchester, which is the culmination of a long history of collaboration and support to the University and alumni as a whole. The MBS regional centers, including the Middle East, will continue as Manchester Business School centers, primarily because they will be rebranded as University of Manchester (UoM) centers from 2017. We will move to the UoM branding directly rather than taking another interim branding step. Alongside this rebranding process, we will extend the academic offering to include programs from other departments in the university, beyond just the business school. Our success in the Middle East and other regional centers has encouraged  schools within the university to look at offering programs and services across the international network established by MBS. This is very positive news for the University and for the regions, which will benefit from access to the wider programs from the UoM. This organic growth reflects the success of the MBS international network, which has created the opportunity and platform for the entire university to harness. So, in the Middle East and across the international network, we will remain as Manchester Business School until we rebrand to the University of Manchester, and from then of course we will continue to represent and support Alliance Manchester Business School, as well as other schools in the university.</p><h4>Have you already thought about which programs you will implement here in the center in Dubai?</h4><p>The UoM has been very active in considering the types of programs that may be successful within the Middle East and we have held discussions with a number of schools, which has ultimately encouraged the university to move closer to the region. Our role has been to share our experience and knowledge of the region with our academic colleagues, based on almost 10 years of operating in Dubai. As with the business school, the university is taking a market-led approach to ensure that we meet the knowledge and training needs of the region, now and in the future, as defined by the public and private sectors. This is influenced by the visions of the regional governments, which are committed to economic diversification and moving toward knowledge-based economies and societies. The focus has been on the education and healthcare sectors, which are especially active. So, we have held initial discussions with the pharmacy school and also looked at the teacher training needs of the region to support capacity building in education. But there is broad interest within the university and we have spoken to a range of schools, from law to healthcare.</p><h4>There has been a rapid growth of interest in MBAs in the UAE. What do you attribute this to?</h4><p>The UAE and Dubai are at the heart of a large region full of potential business education and MBA candidates, who are well educated, relatively affluent working professionals looking for an exceptional learning program and experience. Dubai's regional business hub status creates a rich business ecosystem, attracting global professional organisations that also choose to operate from Dubai, such as ACCA, CIMA, IMA, and PMI. Through radical innovation, the UAE has already attracted top business schools to the country for the benefit of the region, creating access to high-quality learning opportunities. A number of top educational institutions offer a variety of MBA options and increasing choice for students, in terms of program focus, content, and learning format. Such flexibility is good both for students, who can choose the best fit to meet their personal needs, and for businesses in the region, which are competing for well-educated and motivated talent to join their ranks. Demand for the MBA degree among working professionals in the region remains strong, supported by our own experience. Today, the MBS Middle East Centre is the largest and fastest growing in the school's international network, supporting more than 1,900 part-time MBA students in the region. Around 30% of these students are already in C-level and senior management positions and around 10% are already educated to Master's level, underscoring the quality of the talent already living and working in the region. With top companies and talent already here and more coming, it is critical that business programs in the region meet working professionals' demands for a high-quality and rich student experiences, exposure to top faculty, and the delivery of a globally recognized and accredited program and qualification. Educational offerings must feature customizable content and be delivered in flexible formats whilst incorporating a high degree of face-to-face contact with student peers and faculty. As the business education market in the UAE continues to mature, more MBA choices—and alternatives—have been made available to students and this is likely to continue. The UAE's buoyant economy, supported by world-class communications, infrastructure, services, and leisure, further sparked by World Expo 2020, will certainly lead to enhanced career opportunities, with more than 250,000 new jobs to be created, according to estimates. All of this emphasizes the strong outlook for the future of business education in the region and confirms that all the ingredients are here to support its continued development and contribution to the UAE's emerging knowledge economy.</p><h4>MBS Middle East Centre launched a research program into the drivers and barriers of innovation in the GCC. How will this research contribute to the GCC and Dubai?</h4><p>As the GCC moves through economic and digital transformation and diversifies toward a knowledge economy, creativity and innovation will move up the agenda for business and governments. Technology is disrupting many industries and creating new ones, whilst changing the relationship between citizens and government. Innovation will be central to supporting the ambitious economic growth objectives of all the GCC countries. MBS is a research-driven business school focusing on practical solutions and this ground-breaking research aims to help the region better understand and harness its vast creative potential. In April 2015, MBS Middle East Centre launched what is believed to be the first in-depth research into the drivers and barriers to creativity and innovation in the cultural context of the GCC. The program kicked off with focus groups in the GCC as part of the research design process. The research program has been launched to mark MBS' 50th anniversary in 2015 and, in the UAE, to coincide with the Year of Innovation. MBS believes that creativity is recognized as the key skill for success in the 21st century, but understanding the context of people and culture is vital to nurturing it effectively. This customized regional research program will produce powerful, practical research to understand the drivers and barriers to creativity and innovation in the unique context of the GCC. Creativity is the capacity to develop ideas to solve problems and take advantage of opportunities. It is essential in every part of an organization because it is the driver of innovation in products, processes, and services and is central to a thriving economy and society. Managing and leading people to encourage creativity and innovation is a key theme for countries and businesses in the GCC. Creativity and innovation do not happen in a vacuum. Cultivating, leading, and managing creativity is difficult and understanding the cultural context, i.e. the beliefs, behaviors, and background of the GCC is essential. Copying Western approaches just doesn't work. The MBS research will explore creativity and innovation in the region at the level of the organization, team, and individual through a blend of qualitative and quantitative research. We have also worked with our strategic partners and with different associations across the GCC to collect the data, and the program will take around one year to complete. The outcomes will continue to be disseminated in different ways; in an executive summary, a fully fledged research report, and small seminars and workshops. The findings will inform the development of innovative teams and organizations and encourage a work culture that promotes creativity and that will benefit the entire GCC.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is EQUATE's “Partners in Success" motto reflected in your business operations?</h4><p>Our slogan came from the clearly strong belief that the partnership between our shareholders is mutually beneficial and we would like all parties to profit from the agreements we enter into. Our customers are also a key part of our business model, and we share their success, too. We are trying to create the feeling among our staff that each of us is a partner, and by creating this sense of ownership within the organization we are improving our productivity. We also treat our suppliers and contractors as our partners, because we know that if they do not deliver, then we do not succeed. We work with them, and that sustainable partnership is built into our model. In addition, our workforce represents the most important “Partners in Success" in all elements relevant to EQUATE.</p><h4>What kind of growth have you seen in the Kuwaiti petrochemicals industry, and what have been some of the major developments in recent years?</h4><p>Locally, there is limited growth in the petrochemical industry at present, and we are not growing at the same pace as other countries in this region. In fact, we are falling behind. This is one of the challenges in Kuwait. We know the field is limited, but that should encourage us to be more innovative in finding ways to create partnerships. At the same time, while growth is limited, there are still opportunities and media outlets have been highlighting plans by Kuwait Petroleum Corporation &amp; Subsidiaries for mega ventures locally and globally. These include the integrated refinery-petrochemical projects of Olefins III and Aromatics II in Kuwait. We, as EQUATE, want and can definitely contribute an overall added value into the whole industry in Kuwait and beyond. With its world-class expertise, state-of-the-art technology, global presence, and, most important of all, highly qualified human resources in all relevant fields, EQUATE has the ability to be a partner in any part of the world.</p><h4>As EQUATE is an international joint venture between Petrochemical Industries Company (PIC), The Dow Chemical Company (Dow), Boubyan Petrochemical Company (BPC), and Qurain Petrochemical Industries Company (QPIC), how does you affiliation with these entities allow you to operate at a high level and maintain international standards?</h4><p>As we are 42.5% owned by Dow, a major part of our operations is influenced by this fact. Our ownership is divided among these different entities, with the government as our partner as well through the state-owned PIC with 42.5%, and we are generating a powerful formula through the Kuwaiti private sector with BPC and QPIC. The support of the government is needed especially on the utilities side. We have the right technology base, the private sector's sense of added-value creation, and notable employment and career opportunities. When you combine all of these elements together and make them work, the results are positive on all fronts. This is what differentiates EQUATE in the market. We have Kuwaitis applying world-class standards because of our global presence, which makes us well positioned to develop valuable, skilled Kuwaitis capable of working anywhere.</p><h4>What are some of your key projects that you expect to be of high impact?</h4><p>We are pursuing the ongoing debottlenecking project at our polyethylene (PE) plant, which hopefully will be completed during 2016. Our current capacity of polyethylene is 825,000 tpy, and we are working to reach nearly 1 million tpy once the project is completed. The project will give us an additional capability of over 150 bpd, depending upon available feed. At the very least we are hoping for at least half of this. We will be in a good position by the middle of next year to deliver the products. We are also focused on environmental projects that target the reduction of carbon emissions in our industrial operations by re-using CO2. Protecting the environment is one of our strategic objectives and part of our goal to achieve further sustainability within and outside Kuwait. More than ever, we see companies moving away from using CO2-derived fossil fuel, and instead moving toward more environmentally friendly CO2produced from capturing off-gas that would otherwise go into the atmosphere. As we are focused on making environmentally sound business decisions, we have launched two CO2 recovery projects, which are the first of their kind in Kuwait. In addition, we have also launched the Middle East's first plant water recycling project.</p><h4>What are your main goals and ambitions for the coming three to five years, and what are your plans for growing EQUATE's international reputation?</h4><p>Our approach is based on EQUATE 2020 Strategy that includes three main stages. The first focuses on qualifying relevant human resources, the second concentrates on preparing to enter the international scene, and the third aims at venturing into the global arena. The first phase is all about creating as much added value from current facilities, while the second and third are all about giving EQUATE a greater global presence. All stages are based on highly qualified human resources, especially Kuwaitis, through being more specialized, as well as the ideal utilization of technology within an innovative, creative, and sustainable work environment. We know that 2015 is a critical year for us, as we are starting our second phase of growth.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company and for Kuwait's petrochemicals industry in 2016?</h4><p>For the petrochemical industry, 2016 is a year of gradual recovery from the dip it experienced earlier, which started toward the end of 2014, although certain challenges still need to be addressed. We positioned EQUATE to be resilient and to maintain the ability to work in different environments and pursue opportunities in the face of prevailing challenges. The petrochemical industry will be in a better position in 2016, and the market will be more attractive. Our productivity will increase as we will hopefully finalize our PE debottlenecking project and increase our overall production. All of this, however, is contingent on having a sufficient volume of feedstock for our operations. We are seeking to bring extra value to the market at the latest by 2H2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The percentage of Mexican states without a company listed on the Stock Exchange (BMV) is currently 69%. What do you think can be done to change this?</h4><p>Many companies around the country are not willing to participate in the Mexican stock exchange and go public. It is not just about being listed in equities, but also about the debt market. We are collaborating with the Mexican Association of Securities Intermediaries (AMIB) to visit every state in Mexico to speak with companies and convince them of the benefits of listing and participating in the stock exchange, not just in terms of equities but also in terms of debt. We want to show them how easy and beneficial the process is. The BMV is not as big as other stock exchanges around the world; our total value in terms of equities is only 40% of the Mexican GDP. We are preparing to launch a new instrument named FIBRA E that is expected to help increase the size and value of the BMV, and it is designed to attract companies from the energy sector in particular.</p><h4>Why do you think Mexican companies around the country are hesitant to participate in the stock exchange?</h4><p>Many businesses are family businesses, and they may want to keep things in the family for security or cultural reasons or to simply maintain tradition. If Mexico is to keep growing, however, companies will need financing in order to expand and grow. Our task is to help bring these companies into the stock exchange, both the old and new ones.</p><h4>How important are SMEs for the economic development of the country and how can BMV assist them?</h4><p>Small businesses account for 95% of employment in Mexico, making it the most important sector in terms of employment and possibly GDP. Historically, the use of banking and other financing sources in Mexico have been low compared to other countries. But that has been changing over the past five years, as these kinds of finance have gone up from 22% to 28%, and that is mainly due to banks lending more to small companies. Low interest rates have also helped recently. Banking finance is expected to continue growing, mainly based on credit to small businesses, and we want this positive development to also translate into the stock market, both in terms of debt and equity. The aim is to provide companies with liquidity, and we need to find ways to make this more available to a greater portion of companies.</p><h4>Earlier, you mentioned your interest in attracting energy companies to the BMV. What is your strategy to achieve this?</h4><p>In a partnership with the Ministry of Finance, we recently announced the creation of a new asset class called FIBRA E. The term comes from “Fideicomiso de Bienes Raices," which is similar to a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) in the US. A fidecomiso (trust) is an instrument that was launched 10 years ago to buy real estate (FIBRA), such as an office complex or a shopping mall, with investors investing in the fideicomiso through the stock market. The investors then receive rent payments from the cash flow produced by all the real estate covered by the fideicomiso. Currently, there is only one energy company listed in the BMV, which is one the reasons why the Mexican stock exchange is small in comparison to other countries; the large energy companies are not listed on the BMV. The energy reforms that were introduced in Mexico also paved the way for the creation of FIBRA E., which is essentially a fideicomiso but specifically designed for energy and infrastructure. FIBRA ibra E opens up an entire new asset class for investors, as well as new opportunities for the BMV. One of these instruments should arrive on the market early 2016, and we are currently in talks with Pemex and CFE in the public sector and also with several companies in the private sector.</p><h4>Mexico joined MILA this year, alongside the stock exchanges of Chile, Colombia and Peru. How has this integration evolved and what is the significance for BMV?</h4><p>Integration has been slow, because we have to convince investors in those countries to buy shares of a Mexican company, and also educate them as to what MILA is. This is why we are putting a strong emphasis on publicity, because investors need to understand and become acquainted with investment opportunities in countries other than their own. We are also promoting MILA worldwide; we visited Frankfurt and London recently to promote the union. MILA has a bright future considering the size of the economies involved and the large market the four create once united. </p><h4>Do you think Mexico can set an example for other MILA countries because of BMV's extended global connectivity?</h4><p>Mexico is the second largest market in Latin America after Brazil, and by working together with Chile, Colombia, and Peru, it is a huge market on a global scale. We are also integrated with those countries in the Pacific Alliance. If we are to realize the potential that MILA and the Pacific Alliance offer, however, we need to ensure that all of these countries' stock markets have growth potential in order to be able to finance the companies operating in them. In these countries, there are many truly multinational Latin American companies, operating in a region with similar historical, cultural, social, and political environments. These types of alliances and initiatives can help deepen that integration and facilitate business further across borders.</p><h4>Currently, there are 142 companies listed on the BMV. How do you evaluate the performance of BMV compared to 2014?</h4><p>Global markets were volatile in 2015, though the Mexican market has performed well given the circumstances, the fluctuations of exchange rates, and the revaluation of the dollar vis-í -vis other currencies. The Mexican peso is historically one of the largest trading currencies in the world, and many investors hedge other currencies using the Mexican peso. Investors use the Mexican peso because it is a major market and conditions remain relatively stable and predictable. Also, there are a large number of companies waiting to be listed on the stock exchange, which makes the outlook for 2016 trend positive. Growth is expected to be around 2.7-2.8% for the following year, and we are expecting a better performance of Pemex due to the results from the energy reforms.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the highlights of Astana Opera since it was established?</h4><p><span></span>This is one of the youngest opera houses in the world, and certainly one of the most interesting and distinctive opera houses in all of Eurasia. During the 1990s, opera houses in the Central Asian region were closing for one reason or another, but in Kazakhstan classical arts remained strong and important for the country. In modern Kazakhstan, we sought not to limit ourselves to our original native culture, but instead to develop and showcase the cultural heritages of the entire world. It is important not to be closed-off or to limit society, but to be open to all the countries that are developing classical culture and arts. In Kazakhstan, there is a great harmony between classical arts such as ballet, opera, symphonic music, instrumental music, and our traditional drama theatre and music. These cultures merge and work together here.</p><h4>What specific arts do you find most in-demand in Astana?</h4><p>We try not to follow the demand of the public, because the audience is under the influence of many things, such as television and popular culture. Instead, we actively promote the development of culture and arts that we want to share with our listeners. This is our mission. Astana has a wide variety of cultural events to offer. If you want jazz, pop, or national music, everything is available here. We exist in a competitive field, but luckily for us our performances are unique. Therefore, the attention to our productions is very high. The reason for this attention is the high quality we bring to local audiences. Our choir is internationally praised, and it has already won four Grand Prix in different competitions. Our ballet troupe is also very successful, not only here, but also overseas where our performers are invited to perform. They were recently invited to perform in Italy. Within the framework of Expo 2015 in Milan, four of our soloists were invited to participate in the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the Teatro Carlo Felice with the Italian orchestra and choir. The audiences welcomed them warmly and they had positive press. Moreover, the final of the Ninth Symphony is the hymn of the European Union, so this gives more responsibility to the performers of this symphony.</p><h4>What is it about the Astana Opera that attracts people here?</h4><p>There are different reasons. There are some people that want to support the young theater. There are those that are pleasantly surprised that there is a new opera house in Central Asia/Kazakhstan and they want to work together. Therefore, the tourism scene is also getting stronger because of this. Viewers from other cities of Kazakhstan and from Russia come to Astana specifically to see our productions. We not only attract soloists, but also stage directors, costume designers, set designers, and conductors that we invite to stage our productions. When you welcome them warmly, and they come to see that the orchestra and choir are on par with European ones, they want to come back to work with us repeatedly. Recently, we had a premiere of our national opera “Abai" on September 25th and 26th. It is a Kazakhstani classical opera, but even so, we invited the Italian team to work with us. The director was famous Italian director Giancarlo del Monaco, set designer Ezio Frigerio, and costume designer the Academy Award winner Franca Squarciapino. It is interesting for them to work on our productions, and it's important for us that such high level specialists come here. They are aware of all the high technologies and the traditions of theatrical craft that are preserved in Italy and Milan. They don't care if it is an Italian or Kazakhstani production; they can adapt to any culture so long as we ensure the highest standards. Also it is vital for us to learn from these specialists so that our young specialists can continue these traditions in Kazakhstan as well. Our ballet troupe already has offers through 2017, 2018, and 2019, for performances such as Romeo and Juliet and The Fountain of Bakhchysarai from countries like the Netherlands and Belgium. We want to show our national operas there as well and we will work together toward that goal.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have only one way forward: to stage high class, highly artistic productions to the highest international standards. We have opportunities to stage high-level productions and invite the best soloists to participate in them. That's what the public expects, and we must deliver. People see big, bright shows on TV, and it is imperative we are able to compete with that. We have put together a grand show for the 550th anniversary of the Kazakh Khanate, and those who watched it on TV said it was one of the best shows ever staged in Kazakhstan.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the history of Venit Investments shaped your approach to real estate development?<br></h4><p><span></span>Venit Investments was founded in the 1990s and is a family-owned company. It began as a medium to invest in real estate. We started as an investor and our entire business model is based on the premise that we are first and foremost investors. We care for the investment and the capital that we invest, so it is important as it guides the entire process of project selection. In Mexico, some developers make their money by developing another company's project and then collecting the fees and costs that they incur. For us, however, we value the final profitability of the project after it is developed, even though we have our own fees and our own integral costs of developing. It is essential to cover basic costs and make profitability the highest priority, as it is going to translate on profitability on our business. We began developing hotels as a way to invest capital in more long-term commitments, and then developed other projects. We then started growing. We made the decision to focus primarily on the mixed-used niche products in mid-sized cities, as there is a greater opportunity for growth because more people are moving to these cities. Most mid-sized cities are like Monterrey in the 1990s, and we understand the process well, how they grow, and how opportunities are created. Therefore, we take what we have learned throughout the years and apply that knowledge to those cities. We always work with local partners because we also need the expertise of the people that live there.</p><h4>Who are the main investors in your developments?</h4><p>We have mainly Mexican families and businesses as our primary investors. We have established trust with people that know us, and they respect our reputation. We have a few international investors, and we are now in talks for a long-term investment with a European family office, which is an interesting project for Venit Investments. We have been working with American investors as well, but that started just last year. We also try to invest our own money in most of the projects we develop. This reassures investors that we have a personal stake in the outcome.</p><h4>How have demographic changes in Mexico driven your business model?</h4><p>Urbanization started a long time ago in Mexico. Around 80% of the people here live in cities with a population greater than 15,000 people. At the end of the last century, everything was concentrated on three or four cities; Monterrey, Mexico City, Guadalajara, and, in a lesser way, Puebla. What has changed is an increase in foreign investment, which created job opportunities and potential growth in other medium-sized cities. That is creating opportunities for people to experience the big cities but on a smaller scale. Querétaro is an interesting example, as it is a medium-sized city that has several of the most important business hubs and commercial centers. There is also now increased mobility in Mexico. Until a few decades ago, the country was traditional in that people were born, lived, and died in one place. People are more mobile today.</p><h4>How would you characterize Mexico's progress in terms of “green" or environmentally friendly construction?</h4><p>We do not have a government agency that is enforcing anything beyond the basic requirements in Mexico. You have a few places that are trying to enforce green initiatives, but there is no enforcement like in Europe, such as the Carbon Fund. The second issue is the lack of demand. Building a certified LEED building is very expensive, and to build a green building you need an investor who is willing to pay the extra cost—in Mexico there are few businessmen who are willing to invest at this level. Consequently, there are people interested in building those type of products, but they do not have the target market. One thing that we have been doing as a business it to try to find a work around: we do not certify our buildings, but that does not mean that we cannot apply some of the same technology and regulations. We based our construction models on a few of the LEED and European green certifications, and we analyzed what can be applied to the project, and if the market is going to willingly absolve and pay. We should be doing more of this, and the majority of  developers fail to take this into account. We have realized from the last several projects that we can do a lot without having to spend more.</p><h4>What are your goals for the next several years?</h4><p>We are starting two large projects in Bajio, so our top priority is to see them through to completion. One of them is a 10-year project, which is a good amount of time. We will start the first of seven buildings on that project, hopefully in 2016. My priority is to consolidate those projects, as they are our largest yet and are important for us. We are also starting a very interesting condo project in three cities. One in the north, one in the south, and the last one in the center of Mexico.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[challenge-the-market]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Global Alliance is one of the leading insurance companies in Mozambique. What underpins your company's success?</h4><p>We believe that we have to challenge the market and ourselves. We need to dare and disrupt ourselves before somebody else does, and that is what Global Alliance did. We soon realized that the market as a whole had deficiencies in terms of customer service levels, client education, and keeping promises, and we did our best to capitalize on those areas. We understand that, being an insurance company, we are here to pay claims, and we need to provide solutions to our clients and keep our promises.</p><h4>How does the relationship with Barclays enhance Global Alliance's branding strategy?</h4><p>We have a very strong and sound relationship with Barclays, and ultimately we are part of the same group. Barclays is a household name globally and we are trying to leverage all the opportunities that we can in terms of banking and insurance, maximizing cross-selling and bancassurance opportunities on three fronts; retail, corporate, and investment as well as business banking. With so many competitors coming into the market, we also understand that healthy competition will come with the growth of the market. If the market is not growing then dumping will come along and this brings a roller-coaster effect on the entire business and economy chain. Competition will always be there and increase, either quality or quantity wise, and this is very good for both the customer and the economy. It also brings the innovation side of businesses. We have to go back to basics and keep doing what we do best, which is offering the best services and keeping our promises to clients. The rest will come with the correct attitude in and to the market.</p><h4>How do you assess the performance of Global Alliance over 2014-15?</h4><p>Over the past two to three years we have been market leaders, and our overall market share stands at 31% of a total of $278 million insurance market. We have 34% market share in short-term insurance, and 13% in life insurance. We see that there are opportunities in growing our business in the life segment. We are devising strategies to increase our market share, but overall we are happy with our performance.</p><h4>How is Global Alliance's portfolio evolving?</h4><p>When the market is not growing at desirable levels and in the face of challenges, then you have to either maximize the productivity of your customer portfolio through new products/services or create a new market. We have seen that the insurance market is dominated by corporate insurance, and we see that there is a market gap in retail insurance, so are considering tapping into this gap. Everyone talks and is waiting for oil and gas to kick in, but for me this is too much fuss about something that we haven't yet banked and there are so many uncertainties about it. As a business, we have to think about sustainability, so we can balance our earnings and growth in order to remain relevant. All businesses should devise strategies that will keep them in the game in a sustainable way. When oil and gas materializes it will be a bonus for everyone.</p><h4>What industries hold the greatest potential for growth and development?</h4><p>There are opportunities in all sectors. I think that for Global Alliance, agriculture represents great opportunity. With some 80% of the population working in the sector—although we are more interested in insuring the assets for now—there is opportunity in insuring crops also. However, because of the volatility of this business, if the government could create a sort of back-up, the way that other countries have, for the insurance companies, I believe that this would be of interest to the market as a whole. We do this by working together and not individually, like a syndicate wherein the government presents security and guidance.</p><h4>What is the importance of human capital at Global Alliance?</h4><p>Businesses tend to neglect the value of people. For Global Alliance, the greatest asset, which is not measurable but is not on our balance sheet, is our staff. Without motivated, engaged, and well-trained people, you cannot do anything. They form a key part of the organization, and we have many projects and events aimed at attracting, training, and retaining our people. We give opportunities to our workers and encourage them to improve their skillsets and get promoted within the organization. We arrange scholarships and hold training sessions almost every week, which is basically with the sole purpose of offering the best service to our clients also a tool for motivation, and for keeping our staff engaged in what they are doing.</p><h4>What is your mid-term outlook for the local economy?</h4><p>Every single business needs to devise sustainable strategies, but my personal opinion is that there are too high expectations on oil and gas, a sector that is still in its embryonic stage and surrounded by huge uncertainties. This should not be the case; we have to carry on with our businesses, as if everything goes well, we all have see a big bonus. This is a tough year for most businesses, as there is a combination of internal and external factors that are affecting the economy. However, whenever there is a slowdown or a crisis I see new opportunities, because if you are losing on one front, you have to look to another segment to compensate. From now things can only get better. Mozambique has a bright future, and in the long term there are many opportunities to be exploited by all.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What sparked the creation of NTEC in Kuwait?</h4><p><span></span>NTEC was created to diversify the economy through technology, creating new revenue streams besides oil and gas to serve the government's economic diversification goals. The driver behind this strategic decision is that Kuwait has the highest rate of people with Bachelor's of Science degrees or Master's and PhDs per capita in the region, with several having gone to some of the best schools in the US and Europe. They are able to work with technology, and they are able to integrate new technologies into their daily lives, their businesses, and their industries. This is a result of another strategic decision taken by the government back in the 1960s when it built the scholarship system, giving Kuwaitis incentives to go out and become educated and facilitating people to study abroad through cultural attaches around the world by financing their studies, providing them with a salary, and anything else necessary to succeed and return with a good education.</p><h4>What are some of the current focal points of NTEC today?</h4><p>We are instilling the understanding that technology is limitless. NTEC's first objective is to start, develop, and manage technological projects. We have been given the liberty to design business models that best fit the environment by understanding the community's capabilities. The second objective is to deliver advisory and consultancy services through research, government collaboration, and non-government institutes to advise on the best technologies and encourage the adoption of new technology. The third objective is to invest in technology for the purpose of transferring knowledge to the country. This was a significant element of our phase one strategy from 2005 to 2011; learning how to insert certain technologies into sectors and create awareness on what the benefits would be of doing that. The last objective is one of the most important, and that is capacity building and training.</p><h4>What phase is the company currently in, and what is to come?</h4><p>The first phase of investment has been completed and we have entered phase two, which was the “span-out mode," in which we transferred technology. We decided to segregate tech areas into NTEC subsidiaries, as each have their own individual KPIs but have the same mandate as NTEC at a micro level. We launched companies in life sciences, ICT, and energy, and created an advisory arm alongside an HR management arm. All companies are now operational, and we have entered the third and final phase, the operational phase, which is focused on project development and management. Gaining a solid understanding of the technology you have invested in and then seeing the shift from investment to building user capacity, and then implementation, is most exciting. When the penetration of technology reaches people's everyday business, it is very gratifying.</p><h4>What technologies do you see as having the most potential to modernize Kuwait's economy?</h4><p>ICT certainly has a part in everything by default, but the major change is what will take place in Kuwait once it begins adopting new types of renewable energy. Our approach is to teach people about these technologies through pilot projects and then get them to adapt to it. One of the major projects we have completed was a co-op in Kuwait called Zahra Co-op, where we built all of its parking with solar panels for shade. We have a working relationship with the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) and the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science (KFAS), and we collaborate on several pilot projects in order to create public awareness. We have several projects on the way. One that is approved is the building of a self-sustainable home in one of the residential areas of Kuwait, which will minimize the use of any of the country's traditional sources of energy. The home will be a museum for five years, and people can go in and see how it works. The objective is to show people certain technologies that they can use today that could reduce the waste of energy in Kuwait, and energy consumption on MEW, and give them a better and cleaner life with the use of LED lighting and water purification systems, among other technology.</p><h4>Where do you see the most potential for technological change in Kuwait's energy sector?</h4><p>The need today is not bricks and mortar or designers, it is energy, as the MEW does not have enough energy to supply the new homes being built in Kuwait. Thus far, the Public Housing Authority in Kuwait has distributed thousands of plots of land, though not enough power is currently available to support homes to be built. They would have to wait until a new power plant was built. We are trying to present solutions to this problem, as there are technologies everywhere that are developing rapidly. There is technology that uses air to produce water, for example, and it has been available for a long time on industrial scales.</p><h4>What are your priorities in the ICT sector?</h4><p>Our two priority focus areas in ICT are security and e-Government. Everything we do in the ICT sector focuses on providing services for the government that could make the community life easier while transitioning into e-services.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>What we hope to see over the next several years is the aggressive development plan of Kuwait coming into action. We are a small company compared to the mega projects that the government is doing, but we are attempting to make minor changes in every government institute. We are hoping that these changes could assist the government in assessing the issues that they have put forward in the development plan, and we want to be a catalyst for the implementation of projects. We are thankful for the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) giving us the opportunity to show what we can offer. We are certainly interested the development plan, but we are hoping to be more prevalent once the development plan as a whole is put into effect.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your critical assessment on the current status of Peru's energy sector?</h4><p>Right now the market is characterized by an oversupply, meaning that we have to find a balance. We have an energy surplus (+49%), and when you have electricity excess in the market, the prices go down for generators. According to our research, next year we will reach a 70% surplus. Peru is planning to export the energy surplus to Chile, Ecuador, and Brazil. Peru currently sees a strong market in Chile, because they don't have many energy resources and have high costs compared to Peru. Since the country wants to sell and they want to buy, that's the ideal market. The issue is that the importing countries need to establish regulations. If there was willingness and successful integration, we could have energy being rapidly transported from Mexico to Chile. Peru is located in the middle of the Pacific in the whole continent, so it could be a good link and power transmission center for all South America. Apart from that, the transmission is much improved; in ten years the transmission lines have been doubled. Between 2002 and present day, transmission increased from 5,000km to almost 10,000km, and the power also tripled.</p><h4>How are you planning to expand the existing grid?</h4><p>The expansion plan from now until 2020 is very ambitious—around $1.8 billion for transmission and $25 million for generators. The energy and mining sectors are driving and shaping demand. Different calculations and analysis are also made depending on the region; right now, the 60% is focused on Lima, the growth developing in the south is related to mining, and in the north we are growing as well.</p><h4>How much is the group investing in maintenance, minimizing electricity loss, and upgrading existing transmission lines throughout the country?</h4><p>Since 2000 we have managed a system called Reliable Centered Maintenance (RCM) that helps us to work on our maintenance plan. We have a plan based on the machine's reliability; we check the failure analysis, the hidden failures, and we have a special maintenance plan. To boost the efficiency of our operations, we invest in a specialized team, and our staff is involved in the maintenance with the technology that supports those maintenance plans. Human resources is important in the medium and long term because the electric engineering career path is very technical. Previously, many people studied electric engineering, but now young people are trending more toward administrative careers over technical careers. We have to work hard to attract talent, we have agreements with universities, we try to create technology, and talk to the private sector. We need people that are prepared because every day we have more technology and development, and there are more skills being required.</p><h4>ISA has recently entered the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. What factors elevate the group as a leading international player in this field?</h4><p>We need to be sustainable over time, and this is just part of what we do to stimulate development. We have been recognized for managing high world standards indicates that we can work with financial resources, influencing shareholders to support us, and shape investors impressions of the company. We analyze all the opportunities and risks with the social and environmental sustainability of the country in mind.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Along the Tower]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[along-the-tower]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did IHS begin its innovative model in Nigeria?</h4><p>IHS Towers was established in 2001 in Nigeria as a company specializing in building and maintaining telecommunications towers for mobile network operators (MNOs). A few years later, when the operators became more comfortable with the concept of outsourcing the management and maintenance of these towers, we ventured into that market alongside them. We continue to oversee both the management and maintenance for the likes of Etisalat and Airtel. In 2008, exactly around the time of the global economic downturn, it became increasingly difficult for the operators to raise funds and expand their networks. Previously, if an operator wanted to expand into new regions, they had to build a tower that cost around $250,000 or more, depending on the type of tower. That is where IHS started pushing for a new business model that eliminated the operators' need to spend money on building towers. In other words, we came in, built the towers, and charged the operators a monthly fee, which was lower than their monthly maintenance costs. It was an easy transition to this new model for operators as we had already established a trusted working relationship. Today, we have expanded our operating model to include IHS buying towers from the operators, thus they dictate the tower site location. A further model is where we acquire the existing tower and lease it back to the previous owner alongside other operators. This is the most efficient business model and has opened up the telecoms tower market and freed up capital for the operators. As a result, the revenue the operators make selling their towers can be invested back into their networks. Additionally, selling towers to an expert tower management company such as IHS allows for total focus on the task at hand. Our job is to maintain sites, while operators now have time to focus on selling more lines and airtime. We provide a better value solution and help MNOs exceed the quality of service they used to supply. To date, IHS has a sustained 99.99% network uptime across our five-country portfolio. Presently, we also own 60-70% of all towers in Nigeria. That portfolio is available for internet providers, private companies, banks, or anyone else who wants to have their own communications network. In a way we are indirectly improving the quality of service for voice and data. For the past five years, IHS has been building and managing telecommunications towers that are the essential backbone of mobile telecommunications in Africa, the leapfrog technology driving economic development, prosperity, and self-sufficiency across the continent.</p><h4>What have been the challenges of your recent acquisitions of towers from MTN, Etisalat, and others?</h4><p>Going into the commercial negotiations and finding the perfect win-win in terms of pricing has been a challenge. Once that is done, we focus on ensuring a smooth transition, involving moving the towers from MNO's network to ours. We normally do that by shadowing their operations before our team takes over. When on-boarding a portfolio we also need to focus on the site power system. The site could be powered by a generator, a mix of batteries, or could be solar. Currently, IHS manages over 15,500 towers in Nigeria, including both built and bought towers. A tower is a long-term structure and therefore we focus on constantly improving the power system. Our network has to be up 99.9% of the time, which is a point of pride for IHS. Moreover, we continue to invest enormous amounts into our towers and are investing approximately $70 million in our state-of-the-art Network Operating Centers (NOCs). The IHS NOC operates 24/7 and monitors the performance of each of our towers and the rate of energy used while keeping an eye on any equipment failures that may occur. When there are 15,500 towers spread throughout the country, one must keep a close eye on all sites. Then there are the day-to-day challenges; operating the site, managing the surroundings, and dealing with logistical headaches. In order to ensure we're as energy efficient as possible, this year we will invest close to half a billion dollars to roll out our new green energy saving technology. We are working to improve our renewable energy capabilities at all of our tower sites including the replacement of any dated power systems. We are making sure all new sites have environmentally friendly generators that consume less diesel and release decreased levels of carbon emissions.</p><h4>What makes your business attractive to private equity players?</h4><p>We are proud to have a strong and solid pool of international shareholders. Our shareholders include the likes of ECP, IFC, and Goldman Sachs. In 2014, we raised over $3 billion, which we have used to invest in the acquisition of portfolios throughout Nigeria, Rwanda, and Zambia, in addition to the green energy upgrade we are rolling out this year and next. Businesses focused on Africa look at the continent as a risky market but the opportunities and the returns are impressive, especially for a business like ours where we are investing in infrastructure. We are building and managing an asset that is generating long-term revenue. Most of our contracts span 10-15 years or longer.</p><h4>How has the devaluation of the naira and weakening macro fundamentals affected your business?</h4><p>We have more or less been unaffected by these developments as our relations are directly with the operators. We are a B2B business, and have little exposure to the government and individual consumers. However, the operators are facing increased pressures and are asking for help. We are constantly working to improve our services and to provide MNOs with better pricing options.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We have considerable work to do in-house to integrate the portfolios we have recently acquired and upgrade their power systems. You can never take your eyes off of further expansion but our growth is driven by the operators' need to both expand their network and relinquish tower management. We are constantly assessing the African market, looking for operators who would like to dispose of their towers. Our belief is that the future economic and social development of Africa will be exponentially accelerated by mobile connectivity, and our team at IHS is focused on making this happen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the historical contribution that Alfardan Group has made toward shaping Qatar's economic development? </h4><p>Since our establishment, Alfardan Group has been fully supportive of the Qatar government and its growth initiatives. We remain steadfast in this commitment as we consistently adhere to the directives and act on the vision of HH Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, Emir of the State of Qatar, toward providing various socio-economic benefits for the country's citizens and residents. This is evidenced by the fact that for the past 60 years, we have relentlessly pursued business strategies that are aligned with the government's long-term development plans and the strategic goals of Qatar National Vision 2030. The very foundation of our success began more than a century ago when my grandfather, Ibrahim Alfardan, embarked on the pearl trading business. Known for his business acumen, leadership skills, and strong values, he rose to become a respected pearl merchant. The succeeding years saw our family becoming one of the main merchant families in the region, contributing significantly to its development and growth. Until this day, we have remained true to the ideals advocated by our founder; ideals that were laid down years ago but remain relevant until the present time especially in terms of supporting the vision set forth by the country's leaders. Alfardan Group has successfully carved a niche in a wider range of industries, with special focus on the luxury and high-end markets. Our teams of widely experienced and highly trained professionals and staff, who we consider among our key assets, play an important role in ensuring that we remain dedicated to our uncompromising commitment to family values, quality, excellence, integrity, social responsibility, and professionalism across all our projects and businesses. At Alfardan Group, we consistently uphold our solid reputation of delivering high-quality standards in our products and services.</p><h4>How would you characterize foreign investor interest in Qatar's real estate sector and how does today's macroeconomic investment climate reflect this?</h4><p>We are strongly optimistic vis-í -vis Qatar's robust real estate sector in general. High foreign investor interest is due in part to the government's decision to open up its various economic sectors to foreign participation and relax its business regulations. These decisive moves have attracted foreign investments on top of a wide range of incentives offered by the government such as subsidized or nominal rates for gas and electricity, no import duty on machinery, equipment and spare parts for industrial projects, tax exemptions on corporate tax for pre-determined periods, and no export duty. Other factors that are further sustaining and driving this high foreign interest, and thus resulting in the residential and non-residential sectors' growth, include large government spending commitments, a fast-growing population, a stable business environment, increased consumer demand, continued progress on infrastructure projects, and robust private consumption. As a result, Qatar is now considered the fastest-growing construction and infrastructure market in the GCC. For example, the country is keen on investing in various infrastructure developments in main commercial areas such as Doha, a key financial hub in the Gulf, especially as we are in the middle of our preparations for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The developments in Doha, in particular, are expected to create high demand for commercial office space in the capital city. Qatar National Vision 2030 will result in a large growth for commercial real estate as well. Furthermore, the construction of shopping malls is on the rise due to the affluent nature of the population and a vibrant tourism sector, both of which are driving demand for modern retail facilities—particularly for luxury goods outlets. Last year, both rental and sales figures went up, driving the property market further. The local real estate sector is projected to sustain this growth momentum in 2015 and in the years to come buoyed by the country's strong economic performance.</p><h4>What are some of the key driving forces that will be central to Qatar's economic diversification plans?</h4><p>Qatar's diversification plans are crucial to its long-term socio-economic development goals. According to the Qatar Economic Outlook 2014-16 Report issued by the Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics, the non-hydrocarbon sector, particularly services and construction, will significantly spur Qatar's economy. Major ongoing government infrastructure projects, such as highways, expressways, train stations, drains and sanitation, health centers, and education facilities as well as other essential infrastructure for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, will specifically drive the construction segment. The country's sizable investment programs, rising population, and sound fiscal policy are expected to stimulate activities within the local non-hydrocarbon industry as well, thereby increasing its contributions to Qatar's gross domestic product. Qatar National Vision 2030 is another key driver of long-term growth within the sector. To sustain this momentum, the private sector will also have to step up to play an even greater role in Qatar's economic diversification goals.</p><h4>What challenges do you foresee Qatar facing as it looks to continue its YoY growth?</h4><p>It is highly important to sustain Qatar's successes in various fields and look for new ways to further develop its hydrocarbon resources as well as its non-hydrocarbon sector. With a committed leadership, grand vision, and robust and mutually rewarding relationships with international partners, Qatar is well on its way to attaining environmental, economic, social, and human growth and development. The realization of the goals embedded in the National Vision 2030 will address challenges such as balancing modernization with the preservation of traditions, meeting the needs of today without compromising future requirements, managing growth, maintaining balance between Qataris and expatriates, and engaging in good environmental stewardship. Qatar's economic outlook will remain upbeat in the years ahead, backed by strong growth, stable inflation, and large fiscal and current account surpluses.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect more growth opportunities and wider room for expansion ahead of us backed by Qatar's dynamic and investment-friendly business landscape, world-class infrastructure, political stability, and strong government support. We will continue to innovate and diversify our business operations as well as engage in strategic partnerships to maintain our leadership in major industries such as jewelry, finance, real estate, investment, automotive, hospitality, and marine. We will further expand our presence to carve a niche in key international markets as part of our long-term growth plan. Equally, our support for the government's long-term socio-economic programs and the vision of our wise leaders remains unwavering. We will demonstrate this commitment by consistently pursuing the best practices in the local, regional and global landscapes to help sustain the thriving economy of Qatar.</p>]]></richbody0content>

In my view the government does not need to be paternalistic toward the ports and should leave their operation to private enterprise. In fact, shortly afterwards privatization Colombia's ports improved their operations. This has been hugely beneficial to the country's foreign trade. As such, I am not really worried about the ports. They are well managed and have a good level of investment, with some ports belonging to international, and some to Colombian companies. What is a concern is the lack of connectivity between the ports and the cities. This is a severe problem for Colombia. One of our stated goals is to work on the development of the ports. However, the problem is not with the ports, it is with the logistics from the ports to the cities. This is what the country needs to improve on. Currently, it is considerably more expensive to ship cargo domestically from Cartagena Port to Bogotá, compared to shipping it internationally from China to Cartagena. This is due to the poor connectivity and logistics between Colombia's cities.</p><h4>What is Colombia doing to cope with this challenge?</h4><p>Colombia is investing heavily in the 4G Concessions, and in my view it is one of the countries that needs to develop its infrastructure the most. This will bring better connectivity because Colombia's industrialized region is in the center of the country. With regard to the ports, the government is not investing at all; however, private investors are doing so. This means that, overall, Colombia's ports are in a good position to cope with the country's current level of trade. It is important to invest in and grow the ports, but this has to be done at a similar pace to the overall development of the country.</p><h4>The majority of Colombia's ports are located along the Caribbean Sea-Atlantic Ocean coastline. Do you think the country needs more port development on its Pacific seaboard?</h4><p>Yes. The majority of ports are located in the Atlantic, and in my view we now have to focus on the Pacific. I think there is no doubt that the future of commercial trade from Colombia is in the Pacific region in Asia. To this end, the government is undertaking huge investment at Buenaventura, which is one of the key ports on the Pacific. We should not need to develop more ports. I know that there are many investors willing to invest in the ports that are already functioning.</p><h4>Is there any segment that investors are particularly interested in?</h4><p>There is interest in every segment. There are overseas investors interested in the storage and terminals of liquids and in oil. It was not the case 15 or 20 years ago, but now there is considerable interest from international investors who want to come into Colombia and invest in our ports.</p><h4>How important a factor is the navigability of the Magdalena River in terms of solving Colombia's current logistics problems?</h4><p>Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said recently that Colombia will be another country once the Magdalena River's navigability is recovered. It is a significant issue that will definitely transform Colombia because it will give the country a huge advantage. It will be a significant leap forward and many other countries would like to have a similar resource to call on. For example, the development of Holland and many other European countries has been built on having the Rhine, a navigable river that transportation companies can take advantage of. Likewise, President Santos understands the great opportunity the Magdalena River presents for the country to move forward. Having said this, the river alone is not enough; we also need the roads because the Magdalena does not reach the border. Therefore, we are developing a road network that will connect the country, and also an inland port that is only 150km away from the river (Puerto Salgar, which will become the port of Bogotá and the central part of the country). This will make transportation cheaper, environmentally friendly, and safer than the high levels of road transportation we currently have. Another crucial factor is the peace agreement, which should be ready by March 2016. This, plus the combination of new roads and being able to use the Magdalena River, will greatly boost the country's GDP by 2020. It will totally transform Colombia, which is a country that is relatively well off economically, but can only be enhanced by these new transport links.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Over the last decades, Inkaterra has managed to pioneer the field of sustainable tourism in the Peruvian part of the Amazon region. What is the current status of ecotourism in Peru?</h4><p><span></span>When we started in the mid-1970s, the product was nature, and still is. Sustainability for us is essential and not a term used lightly. The key in this industry is making conservation profitable, creating local employment to integrate the community with tourism, and creating value for the people, for the environment, and for the country. Peru is now a strong market, worldwide. It is beautiful, safe, comfortable, with high-quality gastronomy, which is currently one of the most promising segments. Tourism and eco-tourism have always been considered a good venue for generating income, and while we have made many improvements, we are still only just beginning. The international community is rewarding our efforts; Conde Nast selected us among the Top 25 Hotels in South America and our hotel in Cusco is No. 3 in South America, and Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel is also listed.</p><h4>How much is Inkaterra investing in training and hiring staff?</h4><p>Working in far away, remote areas, you need staff to stay long term. Local people who are integrated in the community with their families and social network are the best option for human capital in the long run, so we invest in training them. We estimate that we have trained approximately 4,000 locals, and three of them are currently hotel managers.</p><h4>How have you collaborated with the scientific community toward the development of the local ecosystem?</h4><p>In that regard, the NGO Inka Terra Association (ITA) plays a fundamental role. Self-funded through ecotourism, ITA manages initiatives on scientific research, conservation, education and sustainable development in our areas of influence; the Amazon rainforest of Madre de Dios, the Machu Picchu cloud forest, the Sacred Valley of the Incas, the city of Cusco, and the Cabo Blanco Pacific Ocean and desert. For instance, 747 bird species have been inventoried within hotel grounds and 28 new species to science have been described. Outcomes are presented in publications such as Cusco Amazónico. The Lives of Amphibians and Reptiles in an Amazonian Rainforest (Cornell University Press, 2005), a 20-year-long research led by William E. Duellman, described by Cornell University as “the baseline against which all future studies of Amazonian amphibians and reptiles will be compared." Flórula de la Reserva Ecológica Inkaterra was published by ITA and the Missouri Botanical Garden, a database of 1,266 vascular plant species registered at Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica. And Orchids at Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel (Inkaterra, 2007) presents 187 of the 372 native orchid species at Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel, the world's largest collection of native orchid species found in their natural habitat, according to the American Orchid Society.</p><h4>Where do you see opportunities for investment in tourism in Peru?</h4><p>The most straightforward examples are where the market already exists, in Lima and Cusco. That is for the foreign market, but for the local domestic market the opportunity is anywhere in Peru, because now we have a middle class that expects to have a better quality of life and they can pay for it. A new destination with rising potential is Cabo Blanco, a fishing village in north-west Peru, 3km north-west of El Alto, Talara, Piura. Cabo Blanco still holds two game fishing world records. In 1953, the all-tackle world record (a 1560lb black marlin, filmed when caught by Warner Bros. for its adaptation of The Old Man and the Sea) was landed by Alfred Glassell in this fishing cove in Northern Peru. Four years later, the largest tuna ever caught (a 435lb bigeye tuna) confirmed its international status as a sport fishing mecca. Celebrities visited Cabo Blanco, such as Nobel Prize laureate Ernest Hemingway, who went in search of standing marlins on board the iconic fishing boat Miss Texas, recently restored by Inkaterra and captained by Norm Isaacs, described by GAFF Magazine as “the Mick Jagger of sport fishing." Six decades on, Inkaterra has presented to the Ministry of Environment a technical proposal for the creation of Peru's first marine reserve in the tropical sea of Cabo Blanco, where resides 70% of the country's ichthyologic diversity. By promoting sustainable fishing methods among local communities and developing ecotourism activities, it is helping to recover Cabo Blanco's natural and cultural heritage.</p><h4>What are your short-term ambitions?</h4><p>We have recently launched the new Field Station Tambopata. It is a gateway to the Amazonian environment, outreaching authentic experiences as in all Inkaterra hotels. Field Station Tambopata hosts scientists, volunteers, and national and foreign students in a cozy lodge built with native materials and ancestral techniques of the Ese'Eja native community. Eco-friendly excursions and activities are oriented to research studies on biology, geography, sustainable tourism, environmental engineering, and others, while allowing guests to explore the region's mega diversity and cultural richness.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Mexico to Bombardier's global operations, particularly in terms of rail transportation?</h4><p><span></span>Bombardier cannot be understood today without factoring in its Mexico aerospace and transportation activities. Bombardier's transportation plant in Mexico is the third largest in our network. We have about 1,500 workers in the Ciudad Sahagun location and each job created there typically adds two more indirectly. The Sahagun plant is the origin of our success story in Mexico. We bought the plant in 1992 and we have grown there ever since. Mexico has been key to us becoming a leader in the North American market. We currently produce a large quantity of products that we export to the US and around the world in Ciudad Sahagun. We are involved in train and metro systems in San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Beijing, Kuala Lumpur, and Riyadh, among other cities. We want to continue utilizing Mexico as a foundation for expanding towards South America, especially within the framework of the TPP and the Alliance of the Pacific. We are designing and producing a train here that will be perfect for the South American and Asian Pacific markets. We are aiming at big metro projects in Colombia, Peru, and Chile based upon our established operations in Mexico. We will simultaneously pursue projects in places like Panama, where we are adding a monorail line to the Panama metro.</p><h4>Many of Mexico's major rail projects have been delayed or cancelled in recent years. Why are you so optimistic about the rail industry here?</h4><p>Mexico was in some ways not ready to embrace the large infrastructural projects. In many cases, the field is asymmetrical and needs to be leveled. We want to participate in an environment that is transparent and allows for efficient competition. Bombardier is an industry leader and we are accustomed to winning contracts across the world, so the difficulties faced in the Mexican market can be particularly challenging. There is now the potential of reviving rail initiatives that have been dormant since 1994 when the government policy reprioritized its development goals. Rail projects help to recover urban areas, which can have an impact on reducing violence. Integrating transportation in some areas of cities to more productive levels creates potential for greater prosperity. Better rail transportation also has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Given that there are 12 or more urban areas in Mexico with over 1 million inhabitants, investing in trains is one way of reorganizing interurban mobility throughout the country. There are in fact many rail development programs in place and the trend is shifting in that direction, rail but we need to see opportunities to develop light rail systems in the cities that have the potential to expand Mexico's rail network. If we take the necessary steps on our part to develop these plans, stakeholders such as government planners and many important automotive enterprises are in place to realize this vision.</p><h4>What role has Bombardier played in contributing to the development of Mexico's aerospace industry?</h4><p>Bombardier was the pioneer of Mexico's aerospace industry and its supporting supply chain. Our Queretaro facilities workforce is in the order of 1,500 and the average age of the workforce is about 25 years old. We have a young, committed, professional, and efficient workforce that is central in our success story. We not only assemble aerospace parts, we actually transfer important components and processes to the country. There was a reduction in personnel at the start of 2015 but we are recovering quickly thanks to the surge of Mexican productivity. We have processes in place now to produce composites for Bombardier as well as other brands and we have the Excellence Center for Electrical Harnesses, which with a 0% failure rate is among the best in the world.</p><h4>What needs to be done for Mexico to achieve its goal of being one of the top ten countries in the aerospace industry by 2020?</h4><p>There is a unified effort among the five major aerospace clusters in Sonora, Baja California, Queretaro, Nuevo Leon, and Chihuahua. Mexico will never arrive in the top ten of aerospace producers if we do not collaborate. It is counterproductive for these five areas to compete for the same suppliers. We need to integrate the clusters, which the country is currently doing well. The major success has been working on the non-product areas of operation. It is exciting to market our companies as makers of wings of a plane and other product related items, but there are also less appealing procedures which are nonetheless complex in the non-product related field, such as surface treatment, among others. Incremental consolidation will key factor of continued growth. The potential to rise to the top of an industry in Mexico is a rather singular phenomenon with aerospace, as well-established sectors like the automobile industry are filled with large companies in well-entrenched positions.</p><h4>How would you characterize the Mexican workforce in terms of technical areas such as engineering?</h4><p>One of the key elements for bringing work to Mexico after entering NAFTA was the low cost of the local workforce, however this has changed dramatically. High quality projects now require equitable compensation. This engenders a sense of loyalty between workers and their companies. When engaging in a complex technical task, our workers put forth the very best of themselves and become one with their work. This has its origins in the artisan traditions of the peoples of the Mexican lands. Building an electrical harness, putting together planes and trans, these are literally our modern artisan productions. This engagement from the people is something that is unique to the country. When given the necessary tools, our workforce is going to excel. Bombardier has more Mexicans working abroad than expats working in for us here. </p><h4>Where will Bombardier be in Mexico five years from now?</h4><p>We have a long-term commitment to working in Mexico. The two large investments of $200 million in transportation and $500 million in aerospace are no small feats and we continue investing locally every year. In five years, hopefully we are going to be producing more parts in the aerospace sector. We want to supply some of the most important products in Mexico. It is also our goal to convince the local authorities of the importance of developing inter-city commuter rails. Hopefully we will see Mexican airlines flying Bombardier planes throughout regional markets. Mexico has a bright future and we want to be part of it.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-ethical-touch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you were appointed Group CEO of KFH in October 2014, what have been some of the key elements of your executive strategy thus far?</h4><p><span></span>The board of directors would like to see improvements in efficiency, customer service, and achieve a better integration of the group as a whole. The key focuses were to align all the businesses that KFH owns, making sure that they add value to the KFH bank and provide significant, sustainable revenue to the group. We continue to look at ways of unloading assets that are speculative in nature or not core to our business lines and improve our asset quality by getting rid of heavy risk-weighted assets. This is one method that we use to give us room for our capital to support future growth. Beside our core competencies of real estate and financing, we are in many businesses in many areas such as energy, healthcare, human resources, and IT. As you can imagine, spreading out to so many different industries requires management teams. The focus moving forward is going to be on increasing sustainable top line numbers, particularly in financing.</p><h4>KFH is one of the leaders in Islamic finance worldwide. What is your assessment of the development occurring internationally in the Islamic finance space?</h4><p>The development in Islamic banking products on the liability side has reached a level that is comparable to conventional banking but we have not yet reached the same level of product diversity on the assets side. The financing vehicles that are available on the Islamic side could see further improvement. We have seen a significant amount of sukuks outstanding because of their acceptability by the issuers and by governments. We've seen the government of South Africa, for example, issue sukuks because it can access the market and get the right type of funding with the right price. Investors whose confidence was shaken after the 2008 financial crisis feel more comfortable dealing with sukuks because they are asset based. Borrowers are willing to provide asset-based collateral for the sukuk instruments and thus both the issuer and the investor are happy. We are working to introduce more products on the asset side to a level where we are comparable to conventional bank.</p><h4>The KFH Group inaugurated the first Islamic bank in Germany. What is your view of the level of acceptance of Islamic banking in Europe?</h4><p>If you were to compare us to European banks, we would be an ethical bank; a bank that does not deal with industries such as alcohol, tobacco, arms, and so on. Conventional banks are looking to make money irrespective of the transaction type. We have restrictions on which industries we can finance. When our clients come to us with problems we tend to be more helpful than conventional banks because it is part and parcel of sharia teachings to try and help whoever is in need, versus conventional banks, which typically push for settlement or legal action. That difference in philosophy makes customers appreciate us more in times of trouble. We typically have participation-based agreements with our clients and thus we tend to have the largest customer-deposit base if you compare us with other banks. We had to sit down with the German authorities and explain what participation banking means. The problem with conventional banks is that they rely on wholesale deposits to finance their financing activities. After explaining this to the German authorities, ultimately Islamic finance made sense for the banking system, for the customers, and for the consumer or end-user of the product because he or she is potentially getting the best deal.</p><h4>Focusing on Kuwait, how do you view your role in raising the bar of banking technology and improving efficiency in the Kuwaiti banking sector?</h4><p>We need to invest heavily in technology that provides a positive user experience in order for KFH, and all Kuwaiti banks, to operate more efficiently. If we can automate the transactions that currently go through call centers or physical branches and make products available in a self-service, user-friendly manner, more people would migrate to those channels and this would significantly decrease our operating cost base. It's win-win: better service for the clients and cheaper for the banks. KFH is the leader in online banking across all Kuwaiti banks with an excess of over 250,000 active online banking users. We are looking for payments to be easier with the likes of Apple Pay or Google Wallet, whereby you are replacing your credit card with the mobile phone, or facial recognition technologies whereby you make a payment based on your features or other biometrics such as fingerprint, palm print, voice recognition, or iris recognition. If these potential technologies are developed well enough, we want to be the first to adopt them. Our Turkey operation has a fantastic system called an XTM machine, which is a full-service mini branch including video conferencing and document scanning that is remotely done by speaking to a person on video who takes care of full transactions from A to Z. We are looking at how we can integrate this with our own systems in Kuwait. We will be adopting this as and when we test it and are sure it is suitable for Kuwait. We recently rolled out an idea during Ramadan whereby customers could donate to Zakat Al-Fitr at KFH ATMs. We received an amazing amount of appreciation from customers thanking us for making it easy to donate simply with the click of a button. It was very positive and we are continuing to evolve in this manner.</p><h4>How have you seen the Basel III regulations impact KFH and the banking sector as a whole in Kuwait?</h4><p>Basel III had a significant impact on all Kuwaiti banks, specifically on KFH and NBK. Due to our size, regulators could potentially impose a premium for us over and above the thresholds set by Basel III of 15% in order for us to sustain future growth. This puts us at a disadvantage because at every loan, we risk-weigh to assess the minimum equity or capital we need to finance it. If my minimum is higher than the competition, it is not as economically feasible to me as it is to my competition. Secondly, the returns to investors in the banking sector are going to slightly drop initially because of the capital requirements increases.</p><h4>What are your goals for KFH in 2016?</h4><p>We are continuing down the path of consolidation, which we began early in 2015 by merging the three investment companies: KFH Capital, KFH Investment, and KFH Real Estate. Asset quality and asset optimization is a key target. We would like to build a very good portfolio of assets sustainably to give us the required rates of return going forward. The third element is improving our customer channels by being available 24/7 at their convenience. We are going to revamp our online banking to add more services. We will be spending more on training our staff, making sure they are customer service orientated, and not process orientated. We also have to maintain a minimum of 64% of our workforce to be Kuwaiti. We need to develop Kuwaiti talent to meet the international standards of other bankers. It is a tall order to achieve 75% but it is something I aim to do in three years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe some of the key achievements for Quantum Global Solutions over the past few years?</h4><p>Following a period of restructuring, we relaunched as Quantum Global Solutions (QGS) in mid-2014, which reflected our growth in new geographical locations. QGS is working extensively in the Middle East with our clients and their projects across the GCC, serviced from our regional offices in Doha, Dubai, Riyadh, and Amman. Outside of the Middle East, we have teams operating in Europe, the US, and Asia, managed out of our offices in Istanbul, Chicago, Manila, and Hong Kong. This expansion was primarily driven through client demand and as a company we have grown by around 20% over the last 12 months and expect this trend to continue.</p><h4>How would you rate the success of your unique multimedia platform, and to what extent does it give you a competitive edge in the market?</h4><p>As part of an array of strategies to deliver early settlement of claims and disputes, one unique method QGS uses to trigger negotiations and avoid protracted disputes is through the use of fully animated movie presentations using creative and dynamic multimedia techniques. It is a fact that 90% of the information transmitted to the brain is visual, and our brain processes visual images 60,000 times faster than text. As the saying goes, a picture tells a thousand words. To leverage this fact, QGS has developed an in-house media team specifically dedicated to the preparation of movies and interactive presentations used to demonstrate construction claim entitlements. When utilised in this way, media is particularly useful for making presentations to employers' senior management, the key decision makers who do not necessarily have the time to read and digest the large volumes of narrative accompanying many claim submissions. Media can be used to present issues clearly, concisely, and with a focused message aligned to the desired outcomes. QGS has used media extensively on complex disputes and this has proven to be very effective in securing decisions with positive results. Our focus is to encourage dialogue, to take the emotion out of the subject, and get people to talk. Clarity, focus, and resolution is our philosophy, which is enabled through the use of dynamic media.</p><h4>How much does growth internationally represent your overall strategy to develop QGS?</h4><p>Qatar is our headquarters and our primary market with 75% of our operations. Qatar's population has more than quadrupled in the last 15 years and is expected to continue to increase for the foreseeable future. This rapid growth leaves continued demand for services across all sectors. From a business perspective, with its stable political system and a solid platform of growth supported by the countries energy sector, Qatar is one of the most prosperous and vibrant countries in the world to do business. Remarkable opportunities exist for professional organisations, which have been greatly enhanced by Qatar being chosen to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022. QGS is a recognised and trusted brand locally, regionally, and internationally. Our success is based on client satisfaction, repeat calls, and reputation. Our growth has been driven through the demands of our clients who also operate on a global basis. The balance 25% of our operations outside Qatar is spread 15% elsewhere in the Middle East and the remaining 10% covering our global operations.</p><h4>In terms of Qatar, how important is the 2022 FIFA World Cup and Qatar's National Vision 2030 to the overall growth of the local construction market?</h4><p>The QNV2030 provides a clear picture of how this amazing country will develop across all sectors. Qatar's hosting of the FIFA World Cup in 2022 fully aligns with this ambitious national journey of human development and sustainable economic diversification that seeks a secure future for all its people, built on human capital rather than its finite hydrocarbon resources. These steps build on Qatar's strong international presence in the fields of energy, media and sports. The QNV2030 is defined by four pillars: human, economic, environmental, and social development. Each of these pillars supports a raft of construction projects and schemes with a major focus on healthcare and education. There is now a clear momentum in the market that is clearly seen through the number of projects in progress and soon to be awarded across all sectors, which will see continued growth in the construction market for the foreseeable future. Qatar will continue to increase spending to an all-time high ramping up construction ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. According to recent reports, Qatar plans to increase spending on major projects by around 20%, including the $7 billion New Doha Port project, the allocation of $20 billion toward the construction of roadways and highways, and the construction of eight stadiums at an estimated cost of over $32 billion, some of which are being built afresh, while others are to be refurbished. Our role will keep pace with the market and as the volume of projects grows, there is an increased requirement for our services across the board. The implementation of fast track major projects will include change to suit developing requirements and coordination with other developments. Project change results in additional time and cost and our role is to support the client and the contractor to avoid dispute and encourage amicable resolutions.</p><h4>Looking forward, what are your expectations for QGS, specifically in the year ahead?</h4><p>We are partnering with our clients in Qatar on key infrastructure projects including rail, roads, airport, and the new port plus numerous energy, industrial, healthcare, educational, commercial, and residential projects. In terms of QGS, we will continue to grow in line with the demand from our customers in Qatar and throughout the Gulf. We are probably looking at a minimum 20% growth year on year for the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the important initiatives that the Joint Foreign Chambers of Commerce are working on right now?</h4><p>In the past, our vision was to promote investment and trade in Thailand. In the last two years, many things have changed, and we are now increasingly integrated with the world. Today, we are changing our vision, not just promoting the investment and export business. We are now assisting Thai business people with trade and investment in different countries, because we have connectivity there. Some Thai companies should be globalized, and the Joint Foreign Chamber of Commerce is the best partner to help them invest and become more bilateral. Secondly, our organization has an interest in advancing the development of the Thailand economy as a whole. In 2015, we will present our positioning paper to the Prime Minister on November 25th. In the past, we were working case by case but it is our obligation and duty as economic stakeholders to secure our investments and ensure that our business here can continue to grow the overall Thailand economy. Therefore, we should not just advocate and lobby on certain issues to protect our investments, we should also be looking at the wider scope of the Thai economy.</p><h4>What are some of the most important issues discussed in the positioning paper?</h4><p>Our position paper this year will be focused on making more input on our situation for the future economic structure. The positioning paper is a long-term process, and we believe in an open society. We believe in economic supply and demand. We believe that the more protection you give, the less competitiveness you are going to have. In 2015, our topic is our economy and how we build a future. In 2014, we talked about competitiveness. Last year, we had things happening in Thailand and there was a lot of violence in the street. The military intervened and took over; therefore, we had to learn how to talk to the military. The military is bringing management and stability to the nation but on the economic side, they come to us for a lot of advice. I have told our team that we should continue to present a white paper every year, this is now a mission and vision of ours.</p><h4>In which particular areas are you focusing your efforts?</h4><p>Currently, we have five committees, each with a committee chair and each working on a different issue. We have the international trade committee, the ICT committee, the education and skill committee, the tourism committee and the SME committee. These are the five basic pillars of the Thai economy that we want to develop. In international trade, you can no longer just work alone; you have to be one of the players in the world; therefore, international trade is important. For example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was just recently signed, and Thailand is not included. Our country should be securing this position, and we should be at the negotiating table. It has never been easy to negotiate, but doing so is crucial and we want to support this process and get Thailand into the TPP. Thailand is part of ASEAN, and we are advising the country on how to negotiate its position and support the private sector. There are also many regional trade and nation-to-nation FTAs that are factors in our discussions with international trade committees. As a free trade negotiation, we need to keep our expertise in the private sector to ensure that we are part of the voice to ensure our talent and people are negotiating our requirements for the next 10, 20, or 30 years. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead for Thailand?</h4><p>The chamber's function will be changed. The vision will not be changed, but the mission will be changed due to a different economic period. Thailand has a strong local market, and between the 1960s and 1980s people came here to produce and sell in the local market. In the 1980s, commercial interests also came to export. Thailand is represented everywhere. In the 1990s, when China emerged, a lot of labor-intensive business went to China. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, neighboring countries were opened up such as Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. So, in South-East Asia before the 1980s, there were far fewer places to invest; Americans could not go to communist countries, so a lot of people came to Thailand at that time. Today, there are two things that have changed: the world became more connected and technology has developed. Two decades years ago, I had to write and fax a message from my office. Clients had to make an appointment with me and then we had to make sure that we did not miss the meeting, which was fixed due to the complicated follow-up process. Today, technology has changed our lives and even the communist countries are changing. People are sharing information and even the most basic people are asking how their life can get better. Politics are still there, but everyone is now concerned with economics—even China is more concerned with economics. In the last five years, there has been a lot of conversation about AEC and the direction to go, but it must be different from the EU. When you are together you are somebody, but when you are all by yourself you are nobody. Even for America, even if you are the largest economy in the world you are nobody without partners, which is why President Obama is pushing so hard on the TPP. Even though there is difficulty this is the trend, and we have to understand where we are in the world; we cannot go against the trends.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you position the Daimler brands within the Nigerian market?</h4><p>Actually we are responsible for the entire line of Daimler brands in the Nigerian market, and in particular the Mercedes-Benz brand, which has a long tradition of over 50 years in the market. Parallel to that, we also took over responsibility in Nigeria for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and you will find that brands like Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge have a strong market in the country. The market is driven somewhat by the construction industry and the haulage business, because transportation is key in Nigeria. We have seven accredited dealers that report directly to us so that we capture and cover most of the regions in Nigeria for all of our brands. Of course the biggest relevance for now is Lagos, representing 60% turnover and sales. For now, the ratio of sales of passenger cars to commercial vehicles is about 55-45.</p><h4>In the passenger cars business, Mercedes' global business in passenger cars is evolving. How has the onslaught of new products from Mercedes affected the way that you market Mercedes in Nigeria?</h4><p>There's the constant innovation in terms of the E-Class and S-Class, and now newer products have come into the market. 4x4 technology has also played an important role; the GL class, now known as the GLS, the M-class, also now known as the GLE, and the G-class are our traditional players in the 4x4 segment. Here we have to adjust and adapt to the local needs, and those larger vehicles fit the bill. We also do equipment adaptation for this market; our products have been adapted and homologated to meet the demands of the African markets and, in particular, the Nigerian market. Beyond those premium offerings, there is the compact car segment, which is dominated by the A-class, B-class, the CLA, and the GLA, which is the smallest 4x4 vehicle we currently have in our portfolio. The acceptance is also quite good in Nigeria because the middle class is developing further. People have a choice regarding what to purchase, and they want to play in a field where a little premium is already something they can afford, and that's why we are very prepared also to meet this demand in Nigeria.</p><h4>How have the newer, compact models performed in Nigeria?</h4><p>It took a little bit of time to introduce new models, because it's a traditional limousine market. The S-class has a market share of 78%. In Nigeria, we are proud to always be the market leader in this segment. When we came up with the compact car models we also had to bear in mind that we have to be very competitive in this segment. We have improved and increased our after-sales activities. We have also worked to improve our presence on social media and to encourage people to interact with the brand, which has introduced us to a whole new generation. This is how we are structuring the passenger car business and we have the entire Mercedes-Benz portfolio currently available in Nigeria.</p><h4>How have macroeconomic conditions in Nigeria affected your commercial vehicles business?</h4><p>Until 2013 we had successful growth to report, especially in the heavy-duty commercial vehicle business. Now we have established a very strong position in Nigeria. Here we are talking about a construction sector, in particular, which relies heavily on excellent products with long durability, but also in terms of resale value after a period of five to eight years. After five to eight years, Mercedes-Benz trucks still have a resell value of about 60% of the price of a new one. This is actually a vital aspect that fleet operators and companies that are engaged in the haulage and construction business consider when buying commercial vehicles. In 2014, with the announcement of the new auto policy, the situation became more challenging, even for the construction and haulage companies. So, it was also a difficult year for commercial vehicles, and a lot of companies were affected. However, commercial vehicles are highly specialized, so there is a purpose behind it. Most construction firms see a positive outlook for 2016, and so do we.</p><h4>How has the 70% tariff on new cars affected your business?</h4><p>Obviously vehicles have become more expensive. However, we are working on the feasibility of establishing an assembly plant and are still undergoing studies and planning. The outcome of this will certainly be communicated to the public in due time.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This is the year of reconciliation due to the recent elections in Nigeria and the fact that a new government is still in its formative stages. We are therefore evaluating the challenges and taking steps to reorganize the business in Nigeria. In an organization like ours, we always have to be creative to develop other fields of business, such as the public transport sector, because this is where we are strongest. Last but not least, I believe that it will be clear which direction Nigeria is headed by 2016, and we will be prepared to be a significant part or continue to be a significant part of the automotive business in Nigeria. We have ambitious investment plans approved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the major achievements at Altyn Bank since you took over from HSBC?</h4><p>We have successfully navigated through the transition in 1Q2015 and jumped into implementing our new strategy. The strategy has three pillars. First, we will remain a universal bank with a presence in both corporate and retail banking. The universal banking franchise we inherited proved to be very resilient to the changes in the shareholders' structure as it continues to attract clients and service them in a first-class way. It would be silly on our part to re-invent the wheel and materially change a perfectly working business model of a universal bank. Second, on top of the existing retail offering, we will soon add a private banking and wealth management boutique service that will target only a few hundred wealthy families in the country. The bank has a truly working relationship banking model, and we would like to leverage this expertise to tap new market segments. Lastly, we are actively looking how to capitalize on the digital banking ideas that are floating around. Looking at financial results, the Bank produced a solid performance in the first nine months of 2015. All the key metrics are in green area and well beyond our initial targets for FY2015. As of October 1st, 2015, total assets of Altyn Bank are up by 111%, deposits 127%, corporate loans 68%, and equity 21%, while net income increased four fold. What makes the Altyn Bank team particularly proud is that these stellar results were achieved against a deteriorating macroeconomic backdrop, tenge liquidity shortage, and uncertainty about the USD/KZT exchange rate.</p><h4>Out of the banking products that you offer to your customers, which do you think is showing the most potential in the current market?</h4><p>Faced with an unprecedented shortage of tenge liquidity and uncertainly about the exchange rate, corporate banking clients rushed to secure tenge denominated loans. Our strong balance sheet allowed us to help quite a few clients with needed working capital facilities in tenge. This explains the 68% surge in corporate loans as of October 1st, 2015. In the retail space, all of our three flagship products had a good run. First, we offer one of the cheapest personal loans in the market. We are able to do it by maintaining the high quality of the loan book. Second, Altyn was among a handful of players that continued providing mortgages in tenge. Although yields on mortgage loans may not look attractive in the short term, we like the segment we are giving these loans as it provides an excellent opportunity for a cross-sell. And don't forget these are secured loans. Third, with the help and support of our partner—national carrier Air Astana—we re-launched the co-branded Altyn Bank Nomad Club credit card in late June 2015. The program was so successful that we decided to prolong it for another 3threemonths until December 31st, 2015.</p><h4>What is the bank doing to attract foreign investments to Kazakhstan to continue to boost the local economy?</h4><p>Historically the bank was very strong in the trade finance area. Altyn Bank is capitalizing on its trade finance legacy and limited appetite from foreign financial institutions for any bank risk apart from Halyk and Altyn. The strong credit rating of “BB“ assigned by Fitch Ratings in April 2015 is also helping us to secure trade finance lines from major international banks and thus help our corporate clients with trade facilitation.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016? Are there any specific market indicators that you are looking for to help you achieve these goals?</h4><p>We stay the course and continue implementing our strategy. We fully understand that we cannot be immune to the inevitable slowdown of the Kazakhstani economy, lower demand for financial services, and growing non-performing loans. Nonetheless, we would like to think of ourselves as a nimble player that can quickly adjust to the changing environment. We will remain focused and committed to our key client segments both in corporate and retail banking. Serving large multinational companies is a good example of the legacies we aim to keep n place. In retail banking, we will be working on cross-sell opportunities to further strengthen relationships with our clients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having recently appointed Ibrahim Al-Othman, who has extensive experience in the local energy sector, as the company's CEO, what does this move show about UDC's strategic outlook? </h4><p>UDC is fortunate to have welcomed Mr. Al-Othman as the company's CEO. With over 25 years of experience, Ibrahim Al-Othman has come onboard to ensure the company continues pushing forward and ensuring the primary focus remains results oriented in delivering for our shareholders, clients, residents, and employees. Our foremost emphasis at this stage of UDC's development is to focus on the company's core business as a means to achieving greater progress and profits for our stakeholders. Ibrahim's track record at previous executive positions he had held makes him the right executive to lead this paradigm shift in UDC's strategic focus for the next five years. This means he will lead our progress by increasing profits from real estate development, sales and retail leasing, and management, in addition to overseeing major improvements in the performances of our various subsidiaries and partnerships. </p><h4>How would you rate the success of your development of The Pearl, and to what extent will you be targeting similar large-scale projects to boost the company's growing profile?</h4><p>Today, as Qatar continues to witness remarkable growth, The Pearl-Qatar has become home to a diverse range of cultures and ethnicities, and is now proudly one of the fastest growing communities in Doha. We are therefore committed to sustaining growth and profitability as well as meeting stakeholder expectations by working to complete the remaining phases of our flagship development, The Pearl-Qatar, and to conclude winning partnerships in other key sectors of operation. Our strategy is to focus on the core business, namely urban development, real estate sales, retail leasing, property and asset management, and district cooling. Potential in these major areas is huge, and we are confident in our ability to achieve the satisfaction of our stakeholders.</p><h4>As a company that is listed on Qatar's Stock Exchange, what can the local market do to attract more foreign investment to its shores?</h4><p>Qatar is fairly open for international investors, and its continued development relies to a good extent on the continuing flow of foreign investments. Therefore, Qatar will need to ensure it remains competitive compared to other GCC states if it is to be considered more favorably by foreign investors. This may take the form of additional and more liberalized free trade zones and more detailed landlord and tenant legislation. On our part, The Pearl-Qatar will continue to attract interest from tenants and buyers alike for a variety of reasons, most notably for being the first development to offer freehold ownership to foreigners as well as for the variety of investment opportunities it presents in real estate development, sales, retail, and hospitality.</p><h4>What are some of the recent trends you are noticing in Qatar's real estate market?</h4><p>The country's growing population ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup continues to impact real estate dynamics of supply and demand. Qatar has equally strengthened its position as one of the leading property markets for investors, as the growth in the sector is likely to continue, supported by Qatar's strong economy and government investment in infrastructure and road works. We are also starting to witness a shift towards adopting a sustainable approach to urban expansion and population distribution in line with the Qatar National Vision 2030.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Major opportunities will arise at The Pearl-Qatar in the near future with relation to investments in infrastructure, transportation networks, and tourism as part of Qatar National Vision 2030. Therefore, the real estate market could never be more favourable to investors than it is today. On the residential side, the increase in population, due to recruitment of personnel from outside of Qatar by new and expanding businesses, continues to drive demand for residential accommodation. Our outlook is to move ahead and beyond can be achieved by focusing and committing to our three imperative strategies of attracting investors, attracting more residents and retailers and completing the development of the Island. Focusing on and implementing these three strategies will bring more success in 2015 and the years to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Even though Mozambique is one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa, with an average GDP growth of 7.4% over the past two decades, poverty remains a core issue. What initiatives have to be taken to improve the conditions of those in greatest need?</h4><p>Growth remains strong and this has been the case for 20 years, but consumption growth has been far slower. This reflects slow increases in productivity in the informal and formal sectors. The primary focus needs to be on skills acquisition, and that will require an increased focus on achievements and a higher quality of education in primary, secondary, and vocational training, as well as some focus on tertiary or higher level education for specialized skills that the modernizing part of the economy clearly needs since in many cases it is in short supply. There also needs to be a focus on integrating rural areas with urban areas if we are really going to see a reduction of poverty and an improvement in the lives of the poorest 40% of the population. We need investment to be focused on areas outside of the five larger cities or provincial capitals, with a more decentralized investment plan linked to areas with raw materials and other rural areas. The government should consider linking, both in terms of infrastructure and markets, the areas where the majority of people are living—about 70% of the population lives in rural areas—to the towns that can serve as intermediary points for processing, marketing, and opening channels to the larger primary cities and export channels. This has so far been unattainable. There has been more of a focus on the basic communications infrastructure between the larger cities. However, the current government's five-year plan is designed to pursue more effectively creating links between infrastructure and the smaller towns and furthering backward linkages to rural areas.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the achievements of the Mozambican government in that regard?</h4><p>The government has stated its intention for the renewed development of traditional sectors, and the process I described is an equally important part of their development strategy in comparison to that of the large infrastructure and megaprojects. Megaprojects can provide the growth, but the traditional sectors need to provide more in terms of growing employment. To the government's credit, this is increasingly being integrated into sectorial development plans. There is a realization that waiting for the megaprojects to provide all of the growth in employment will take too long, meaning that the government needs to be more active in terms of supporting labor-intensive sectors like agriculture.</p><h4>In which sectors and industries do you see the most potential?</h4><p>This country has a large amount of raw materials and natural resources that can be used in the agri-business sector, which is the prime sector that many investors are increasingly looking into. Also, certain service sectors are promising, and there is potential in the light industry segment. There is a reasonable amount of cotton production, for example, and there is also interest in the textiles sector. When you look at what is going on now in terms of primary natural resources, most of the inquiries come back to agriculture and agribusiness, including forestry. The government is realizing that the tobacco segment is an area that continues to grow, but I think they would like to see the cashew segment improved quite a bit, and cotton, soy, and maize, while strong, could be further expanded. It is unfortunate that the country is a net importer of rice, as Mozambique could be a net exporter of all of these agricultural products in as little as five to ten years.</p><h4>In the newly released Doing Business report, Mozambique came in at 127th place. How would you interpret this result and last year's economic performance?</h4><p>If you look at this year's rankings, especially the ways in which it is measured relative to the frontier of the best performing countries, there have been some clear improvements in terms of starting a business, as well as in the issuing of construction permits and registering property. Mozambique is about two-thirds down the list out of around 180 countries, but on average, its distance from frontier status is only about halfway, which means that there are a lot of countries in between Mozambique and the frontier level. This is a challenge for Mozambique because ease of doing business is a relative measure of a country's attraction for investment. Improving access to finance is a recognized area of priority, and resolving this is partially an issue of property registries, collateral registries, and the financial inclusion of those in the informal sector, which is a major focus here for the Ministry of Economy and Finance as well as the Bank of Mozambique (Central Bank). There have been a number of important conferences here on financial inclusion over the past year, and it is really one of the key focus areas for the country. Although Mozambique does reasonably well in access to electricity, the area that has not been picked up on in the Doing Business is the stability of the supply of electricity which has been a problem over the past year in Tete, Nampula, and now in Maputo. This is something that is particularly important for making sure that productivity levels can remain high in the manufacturing sectors as well as meet the needs of other sectors more widely. This issue is increasingly on the radar screen of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. It is a difficult area because providing secure energy supply requires billions of dollars of investment. There are some other large projects for expanding energy production that could use billions of dollars of investment, but we see energy security as a top priority.</p><h4>As of October 2014, the Mozambican World Bank portfolio had 23 projects with an overall net commitment of approximately $1.5 billion distributed across all major sectors, as well as 53 Trust Funded-operations with total allocation of $222 million. How is this portfolio growing?</h4><p>Almost two-thirds of our portfolio—which is currently about $1.8 billion to be implemented over four years—are in the top five sectors, which are water, education, rural-urban integration, transport, and the natural resources and environment sector. There are other sectors in which we should be more active, for example, agriculture. Most of the large infrastructure projects are finally being started in an accelerated fashion, with the final designs, bidding, and drawing up of contracts complete. We are entering a phase in which disbursements are going to accelerate. The primary and secondary education projects are being well financed, and these projects have been moving ahead steadily. The water sector, because it is so large, is being slowly implemented for the building of additional dams and water supply facilities. Overall, the portfolio is performing well across the board.</p><h4>What is the World Bank's forecast for Mozambique's mid-term future?</h4><p>The World Bank expects growth to be between 7 and 7.5% over the next few years, with continued investment in Mozambique's extractive sectors and growth in related sectors (construction, transportation, trade). In the short run, resource-related investment and public investment will be major contributors to growth. If investments in Mozambique's extractive industries do not materialize or are significantly delayed, we would expect growth to slow down to more moderate levels. In the medium term, we expect growth in Mozambique to accelerate further as gas exports start toward the beginning of the next decade. The development of the gas fields in the Rovuma basin present an incredible opportunity for Mozambique, and the extent to which it will benefit Mozambique of course will depend on how the country choses to use these resources. A judicious use of resources would mean investing the rents from natural resources into other forms of capital, such as in infrastructure, human capital and a more capable government and stronger institutions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Accenture adapted to the rapid technological change that characterizes the Nigerian market?</h4><p>The changes observed in Nigeria over the past couple years centered around mobility. We have had 143 million phone subscribers, close to 30 million of which are smartphone users. Internet penetration is rising, and this has encouraged tech startups, whereby more apps are being produced for mobile phones than ever before. There are also many tech companies and GSM companies that are going beyond voice into data and multimedia. Nollywood is also highly active with digital video and music downloads and entertainment. The second change I have seen has to do with the cloud, and GSM companies are now providing cloud-based services. An SME can now have operations in the cloud, and banking, too, is becoming cloud based. In the past Accenture had three functions including technology, consulting, and outsourcing. But today we deliver five major services: technology, digital (including mobility and the cloud), consulting, operations (outsourcing), and strategy. Accenture realized that social media, the cloud, mobility, and other trends are here to stay. We started a new business called Accenture Digital that focuses on clients making decisions influenced by mobile devices and fast changing huge volume of data. We are also attracting talents to Accenture Nigeria, and we have a choice to either build or buy. We have had to do a mix of both in terms of training and recruiting.</p><h4>Nigeria is considered to be one of the fastest growing technology and communications markets in the world. How does this market factor into Accenture's global operations?</h4><p>Globally, Accenture has five major industry groups with the government, financial services, communications, resources, and operations. Telecoms is a major industry sector for Accenture, and is a major part of our CMT Practice (communications, media and technology). Given the maturity level of the Nigerian market, we are mostly involved in the telecoms sector in Nigeria, versus technology and the media. Those two sectors are still fragmented, while telecoms is a major growth area, accounting for upward of 18-20% of Accenture's local revenues. Telecoms is quite important for us, and we are working with two of the four telecoms providers to serve the public.</p><h4>Has the devaluation of the naira led to an increase in more efficient technology services and solutions, in line with national trends?</h4><p>The devaluation and subsequent decline in revenue, as well as the uncertainty of elections all made 2015 a highly challenging year for our clients. In addition, we had uncertainty with security in 1Q and 2Q. Our clients have responded in a number of ways, one being to cut their discretionary spending. Some of them are also looking to make structural changes, and have looked at outsourcing their IT departments. They are changing their management strategies and are looking for wars to consolidate and rationalize their IT footprint. They are doing so to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and ensure optimization. A number of clients are making good use of this crisis to affect management changes and improve efficiency. They are going for local and predictable operations. We are working with two banks to develop strategies for digital banking. We are looking at using social media, the cloud, and digital analytics to provide banking services to the next generation. That will reduce the need for human interactions, thus reducing costs. Some of the consumer goods companies are looking at how technology can improve their route to the market to accelerate the number of goods sold, and how they handle customer service delivery. This is to ensure a better customer experience and increase growth. For some it is a cost-cutting measure, while for some it is about using technology to improve efficiency and open up new sources of revenue.</p><h4>With the telecoms business being a major part of your clientele, what opportunities do you see for Accenture over the coming years?</h4><p>We are focused on delivering technology solutions, whereby a number of our clients are targeting us specifically for that. Another area of growth we anticipate is operations, and we will be working with clients to run certain parts of their business. Those are the two areas that we anticipate good growth from.</p><h4>In terms of hiring, you identified that you either have to build talent or import it. When you look for talent in Nigeria, do you have difficulty finding qualified people?</h4><p>There is a shortage of talent in Nigeria, and most graduates seem unprepared for employment. Therefore, we have started a one-year graduate training program. We focus on the skills that Accenture requires in their employees such as data gathering and analysis, communication, business writing, team building, interpersonal skills, negotiation, and basic technology skills. These form the basis of the skills we are looking for, and these are also all-important coupled with ethics and doing what is right for the business and in business. There are other areas where local Nigerians do not have the right experience and relevance, and we are having to attract Nigerians from the diaspora who are willing to return.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>A stable security situation and general safety would allow our clients to conduct business better in the different geopolitical regions of the country. Our clients would then be able to use technology to serve nationwide and improve their supply chain, especially the supply chain to the far north and the deep south. This will improve business confidence and allow the mentality that Accenture will be able to help more with operations once stability improves. The country will then be back on its growth trajectory that will greatly exceed 5% next year and will, in turn, also allow further growth for our clients. Accenture has been capable of growth of 20% over the past five years, which has continued YoY. This year we are not in that growth territory for the reasons outlined earlier, although we anticipate returning to it in 2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[great-results]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What CECEC achievements do you feel most proud of at the moment?</h4><p>We have many achievements in many different areas. First, the company keeps on growing; as a top contractor, we have our core business in the construction and infrastructure sector, and in both sectors we aim for the biggest projects in the region. One example is the Kuwait Airport terminal tender, which is probably the biggest single building project in the Middle East or even in the world. In the infrastructure sector we are challenging for the Etihad railway, which really requires a lot of muscle. This is a very good indicator of our strength. Whether we win the project or not is another issue, but at least we know that we are up for the challenge. We are present in three other main areas, one of which is steel structures. We have overcome a lot of difficulties at the Midfield Terminal Building (MTB) at the Abu Dhabi International Airport. The steel structure there was probably one of the most challenging in the world and, together with the effort of the client and consultant, we are now reaching the final stage and will be taking off the supports as the steel structure takes shape. After working hard for years, we are finally seeing great results. Our effort and our commitment was appreciated by the client. Also, at the airport, we are working as the specialist on the MEP works. We are doing well and I am feeling quite positive about our achievements and our hard work over the years. Another sector we are doing well in is the investment sector. We are talking about investing together with existing partners and trying to provide project finance for quite a lot of other potential business partners.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the Dubai Viceroy Hotel project?</h4><p>The project was designed and run by our partner SKAI Holding. We have a joint venture with SKAI Holding, which is a minority shareholder. We believe this is very interesting and the perfect arrangement for us to join hands and align our interests. SKAI Holding has great experience of the local market, and it understands the appetite of the buyers. The project so far is six months ahead of schedule, which is very difficult to achieve, but we challenge ourselves to keep up the progress, and as a result today, we are ahead of schedule. This is a great achievement that has been possible due to a joint effort between the client, the consultant, and our team and sub-contractor suppliers. In the financial hub we are also doing very well and we have just recently finished syndication, which is a reflection of trust that the financial sector has in us. Quite a few major banks in the world joined this syndication, which includes ICBC, Bank of China, and quite a few other Chinese banks like Minsheng Bank. With the successful closure of the project financing, all our development is well supported financially so we can now focus on the construction and try to finish as early as we can.</p><h4>What can you tell us about the status of the Sheikh Zayed Road flyover?</h4><p>We have two current projects on the Sheikh Zayed Road. One is the access to the Dubai Park, which is not a big project but is very challenging because the client has only given us 14 months to finish. We are doing well so far and need to spend even more effort to finish the project on time. We are looking at maybe a one-year timeframe. Our team is working day and night and trying to keep up with our program. In relation to the flyover, we have recently commenced the 2.5km bridge between the second and third bridges. This is a sizable interchange to improve the traffic on both sides. The project started in 3Q2015 and we would like to continue with the same kind of commitment to our most respectable client out here, and be sure that we finish the project within the given timeframe with the highest standards possible.</p><h4>Akoya Artesia Tower is the third cooperation you have undertaken with Damac. What factors have led to such a trust relationship with Damac?</h4><p>Damac is becoming a more mature company, so it is good to extend our collaboration with them, given that we understand each other's strengths. We do have our weaknesses, but with our long-term relationship and understanding, we can take on the challenge together. Generally the project is doing well and is on track.</p><h4>What would you consider to be the biggest challenges in the real estate and construction sector in Dubai?</h4><p>The main challenges come from different angles; challenges pertaining to the complexity of a project and technical challenges such as those related to the Abu Dhabi Airport project. On one hand, clients often lack experience, while on the other, consultants are not always sure how to address complexities on the technical side. As specialists we try to cope with demanding programs, so the key is commitment. The clients have commitments themselves, which is why we like to work on government projects as they have made the budgets available and their priority is getting the project finished as quickly as possible. I am glad that when we encountered huge challenges with the Abu Dhabi International Airport project, we had such good clients and consultants, which allowed us to work out a solution together. Another key factor is trust. No matter who you are working with, nobody is perfect and we all sometimes make mistakes as human beings. Without the trust from our clients and partners, we can easily lose a relationship. It is crucial that all parties have confidence and trust for mistakes to be addressed and corrected. The third factor is that, as a contractor, you have to be confident that all your projects will be carried out to completion. To have this confidence, you have to align the strengths around you with your contractors, suppliers, and clients to become the driver in the project.</p><h4>CSCEC ranks 37th in Fortune Global 500 for 2015, thanks to revenue of $129.89 billion. What are your expectations for growth here on out?</h4><p>I anticipate that we will increase our contract value by 40% and our revenue value will increase by 30% to 40% in 2015 over 2014. That is why we have been extremely busy, to ensure that we can organize ourselves in an even more efficient way to remain as competitive in the market as possible and provide the best service to our clients. We are lucky that we have great support from our HQ both financially and technically and also for resources. We are getting a large number of management staff not just from Beijing but also from our sister companies in overseas operations. We do not feel that we necessarily have a shortage of management staff but we need to naturally increase our workforce.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has motivated Cervesur as it has invested and grown in Peru?</h4><p>After long doing business in Peru, we had to develop the skill of growing several businesses, while addressing a variety of risks. When risks are presented that are unrelated to your business, it is a sign you should be more diversified, which is one of the characteristics of Cervesur as a holding company. We have invested and diversified in cotton textiles—the entire production of the garment—which is seldom seen in the world today. This gives us strength to cope with the variations in the market. We are in several businesses that are dedicated to services. We invest in the main importer of machinery in Peru and in the main steel plant. Our policy is to try to be present in the businesses and the activities where Peru has a comparable advantage, to ultimately develop into a competitive advantage.</p><h4>Have you been concerned about the fall in mineral prices and its effect on the Peruvian economy?</h4><p>In the last decade, China has become a country that demands goods and services in foreign markets. Now, after decades, China's growth is slowing, bringing prices comparatively lower than what they were 1½ years ago. That diminishes the possibilities of growth in Peru and there is also the challenge of producing out of the advantage of having this base of growth in mineral exports. So we should excel in other products that we can produce, not only for the national market, but specifically for exports. Peru is a country that has a small national market and to attain considerable growth, it needs to export. That is what we should do in the coming years, although it will not bring us to the growth rate we achieved in the last ten years. Now, we will focus on developing the market for goods where we can be competitive.</p><h4>What role you do see for agriculture as a larger part of the Peruvian economy in the future?</h4><p>With the necessary framework, it should be one of the legs on which Peru's growth can be developed. Economies grow steadily if they have different bases of growth. The base of growth for Peru has been mineral goods and raw material, and based on that, there are some developing industries. 17% of Peru's GDP is dependent on industry and it should be 25%, but there is no industry today without technology. Investment in technology is necessary to drive any industrial venture.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the textile industry, now that international companies have moved away from Peru and are now sourcing in Central America and Asia?</h4><p>We have to differentiate the textile businesses across the entire textile business. One segment is weaving, which is something that has to do with high standards of production technology. Production of cloth, on the other hand, is the other end of the business. More sophisticated production processes with higher value are things in which Peru has skill. Our raw material is also better than other alternatives. Peru has a relatively high gross export value of cloth, whereby we produce expensive garments. We cannot compete with China on high volume, low-priced goods.</p><h4>What potential do you see for the Pacific Alliance to play a transformative role in the Peruvian economy?</h4><p>That is beginning to be seen as an alternative, specifically to arrangements like Mercosur, or any other alliances in the region. One of the advantages of this alliance is that the partners have a clear idea of a free market economy. The markets, ventures, and companies that develop in each country can compete for better conditions in a free economy setting.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key areas of cooperation currently in place between Thailand and the UAE?</h4><p><span></span>The areas of cooperation are diverse but our economic ties currently stand out, if you consider that the UAE and Thailand are each other's biggest trading partners in the Middle East and Southeast Asia respectively. The UAE is also vital for our energy security as it has been our number-one import source of crude oil for many years now. Beyond the macro-level, I think that the people-to-people relations between both countries are actually very close. Many Emiratis have visited Thailand as tourists, many among them medical tourists, and they have a good impression of my country and its people. On the other hand, there are currently about 10,000 Thai nationals residing in the UAE and working in various sectors, ranging from heavy industry and infrastructure to the hospitality sector and the airline business; Thai people are contributing to the growth and prosperity of the UAE as well.</p><h4>The UAE is Thailand's primary trade partner in the region. How has the volume of bilateral trade developed over the years and in what ways is the UAE a hub for Thai trade to the Middle East?</h4><p>The UAE is not only our primary trade partner in the Middle East, but was our fifth largest trading partner worldwide in 2013, with a trade volume exceeding $20 billion for the first time in history. Both our exports to and imports from the UAE have risen continuously over many years, although for 2014 Thai imports from the UAE may decline for the first time. However, there is no cause for concern as this drop is mainly due to the falling average price of crude oil, which dominates our imports from the UAE. The UAE is a perfect hub for Thai trade to the Middle East because of its highly developed infrastructure, both physical and digital, its excellent connectivity to other parts of the world, and also its enabling trade and economic policy. This is best illustrated by the fact that the only Thai Trade Centre, which is the government export promotion agency, in the Middle East is based in Dubai. A number of large Thai companies such as PTT, Siam Cement Group (SCG), and Charoen Pokphand Foods (CPF) also have a representative office in Dubai, which cover not only the Middle East region, but also Africa in some cases. With the opening of Khalifa Port, the construction of the Midfield Terminal at the Abu Dhabi International Airport, as well as many other big, exciting projects, Abu Dhabi will certainly gain significance as another trade hub in the Middle East in the medium-term too.</p><p class="quote">“The UAE is not only our primary trade partner in the Middle East, but was our fifth largest trading partner worldwide in 2013."</p><h4>What opportunities exist for the UAE's private-sector investment in Thailand?</h4><p>Foreign investment opportunities exist across all sectors in Thailand. We have an investment-friendly economic policy, a highly skilled workforce, reasonably well-developed infrastructure, and a favorable geographical location. These factors will be boosted even further by the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 when the 10 Southeast Asian nations become a single market and production base with free flow of goods, labor, and capital—and Thailand is right in the heart of it. In the coming years, there will be numerous investment opportunities in the logistics industry and related sectors, especially in the transportation infrastructure area, following the recent approval of the infrastructure development plan for 2015-22, which targets the improvement and expansion of the provincial rail network, highways, a sea port, and public transport in Bangkok. For the very short term, UAE oil firms might be interested in the coming petroleum concession bidding round, which is the first petroleum concession in Thailand since 2007. The Thai Board of Investment (BOI) also just approved the Seven-Year Investment Strategy for 2015-21, with a view to promote investments that create value for Thailand and those that have positive impact on the society and environment. Special incentives will be given to investments in, for example, high-tech and creative industries, the digital economy, projects located in 20 lower-income provinces, as well as the five special economic development zones in the border areas. In this regard, I would encourage potential investors to study this strategy in order to optimize their investment decisions. Moreover, the new investment promotion package also encourages the establishment of the International Headquarters (IHQ) and International Trade Center (ITC) in Thailand. IHQs and ITCs will enjoy various benefits including tax privileges; for instance, tax-free income from dividends and capital gains from overseas investment, tax-free income received from providing services to subsidiaries, and tax-free profit from trading products purchased from foreign sources and sold to foreign destinations. Additionally, the personal income tax on expatriate staff of IHQs and ITCs is reduced to 15%, which is half of the normal rate. Foreign companies that have production units in Thailand as well as in neighboring countries can establish their regional headquarters in Thailand and enjoy such benefits under the IHQ scheme. Foreign trading companies without production units can also apply for ITC privileges and carry out their out-out trading activities from trading bases in Thailand without any tax burden. These special privileges for IHQs and ITCs will soon turn Thailand into a global trading hub in the very near future contributing to even higher growth in the service sector, intra-ASEAN trade, as well as trade between ASEAN and countries outside the region.</p><h4>How do you see the two countries further strengthening ties in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>Naturally I would like to see bilateral ties strengthened in all areas because this is what my colleagues in Bangkok and in the UAE are working hard to achieve. I have no doubt that our economic relations will grow further as both our countries are open economies with complementary characteristics but tremendous potential, especially the UAE with the prospect of hosting the World Expo 2020. Thailand and the UAE have agreed to establish a Joint Commission (JC) as the forum to drive forward our collaboration in all dimensions, and I sincerely hope that we can organize the first JC meeting some time in 2015. This would be very timely, as it will coincide with the 40th anniversary of Thai-UAE diplomatic relations. Lastly, I hope that the people-to-people ties will remain as strong as they are, if not become even stronger.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Absolutely Paramount]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[absolutely-paramount]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the primary purpose of the EABC?</h4><p><span></span>Because Thailand does not consider the EU or Europe as one nation or allow non-nations to have chambers of commerce, we are acting as a representative body for European countries as a whole. It is important to have an association that represents the interests of Europe as a whole, because as a whole, Europe represents the second largest trading partner to Thailand. Similarly, from the government's point of view, it doesn't want to talk to 28 individual countries, allowing it to concentrate on the US, China, Japan, or Europe as a whole.</p><h4>What is the importance of the FTA negotiation between Thailand and the EU, and what is EABC's role in determining its' outcome?</h4><p>The FTA negotiation between Thailand and the EU is of paramount importance for European business here because Thailand lost its GSP preferences last year and many European companies here are exporting back to Europe. Depending on the commodity, companies pay between 2% and 20% more on import duties. The FTA was supposed to replace these GSP preferences, to give you an idea of how important the FTA would be for Thailand. It is a win-win situation. It is important for Thailand, but also for Europe. Every year, there is the EU-ASEAN Business summit. When I first visited the summit, I met the EU trade commissioner, and I was asking him why we don't restart the FTA negotiation. He said Thailand would not be interested. I took this up, and we had a chance to meet the, at that time, deputy Prime Minister Kittirat. We had a meeting there, and I asked him why Thailand doesn't have FTA negotiations with the EU and he said he really wanted to. From that day onwards, Thailand really pushed for FTA negotiations. They have had three or four negotiation rounds already, and it has gone very well. It has gotten close to an agreement, but the change in government happened and from that day on it has been interrupted. It's not suspended, just interrupted.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of competition in ASEAN countries and where does Thailand fit into this mix?</h4><p>When you look at the ASEAN countries, every country has problems at the moment. Indonesia has major problems because of nationalistic policies. If you do not grant work permits to expatriates, how do you expect to get investment into your country? Malaysia has a problem with its prime minister. The currency is down 16.5%, which is a significant problem. If you take Myanmar, it is a darling for investors; however, it is not really taking off yet. Investors need a long-term view. You can look at almost every country in ASEAN, and they have problems, except maybe Vietnam, which just signed an FTA with the EU. Vietnam is the biggest competitor to Thailand at the moment. Otherwise, I don't see other countries that can replace Thailand as the center of ASEAN, which is why it remains the most important country for European investment in ASEAN. Then you can expand from Thailand to other countries. Of course, there is Singapore, which takes around 50% of the investment in services. We told the Thai government it should liberalize the service sector, which will develop Thailand's GDP greatly. There is a study and the preliminary results show that from the liberalization of the service sector, Thailand's GDP could grow 6.28% in one year. We always tell every government that the liberalizing of services will grow the economy. The growth of an economy nowadays isn't in manufacturing, but in services. And Thailand is limiting its growth by restricting foreign investment in this area. That is an important part of the FTA negotiations. With this liberalization, it could really jumpstart the economy. If you take all the other factors of liberalization from the FTA agreement, it could achieve 9.34% growth in one year according to this study. That's extremely important to Thailand.</p><h4>Other than those, what are the main challenges within the Thai economy?</h4><p>The other challenge to Thailand is the so-called “middle income" trap. That means that Thailand was a good investment place for manufacturing by using relatively cheap labor, but with a high quality level of production. Labor is not so cheap anymore in Thailand; it is much cheaper in Vietnam. Therefore, the industry has to become more competitive. We have explained this to the government, and I trust it has understood it has to change through the promotion of R&amp;D, innovation, and creativity. Maybe it is the wrong timing because when you suddenly change your whole promotional scheme, people get confused. We asked the government to wait a year, but it didn't listen. Therefore, the middle-income trap is the other challenge. Thai industry has to automate its production and install more efficient , automated machinery. That is the key for the industry. Firms here must renew and reinvent themselves. It is important they take the next step to become more competitive. You have to be very competitive in this world, so your product management must change.</p><h4>What is the outlook for the agreement in 2016?</h4><p>There are two levels. When you look at the global level, economies all over the world are in trouble. The growth rates are low, even in China, and Thailand is dependent on China. The EU is not really booming. The US is coming out of its recession, and it is starting to grow, but not remarkably. The state of the economy globally is not at a good pace to really move Thailand forward. Thailand is an export-oriented country, so it is affected by these conditions. The macroeconomic conditions are one part of the equation. The second part is of course the local aspect. That means FTA and GSP are not there. The export business, for European businesses, is down because of that. Then, we have the problem of local confidence. Consumer confidence is weak because most of the consumers have overspent in the last two years. They have no credits left for purchases. Then, we have the public area of investment, which is lacking at the moment. Spending in infrastructure projects is lacking behind and consequently disbursements are not as much as it was supposed to. However, that is going forward now, so there should be some kind of stimulus.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about some of Samruk-Green Energy's recent projects?</h4><p>The 2MW solar power plant (SPP) in Kapchagay city was the first pilot project in renewables on that scale. It was important for us to have experience in designing, construction, and operating a such project. There were two stages; the execution of a feasibility study and detailed design. Both of these were done by local engineering and design companies, which was beneficial not just for Samruk-Energy, but also for everyone involved. Local construction and operating companies also had an important part to play. Currently, the 2MW SPP is a unique and industrial place that can be visited by university and school students who want to work with physics and mathematics. When we were constructing the pilot plant, we initially wanted to check its cost effectiveness to see how it would work in reality compared to the results of our feasibility studies. The SPP was actually launched for commercial electricity generation in October 2014, and from then on we began to generate information regarding the station.</p><h4>To what extent has the plant project played a role in sparking the country's interest in renewable sources?</h4><p>If you look at the other companies in the renewable market, you will see the 50MW solar power plant being run at Burnoye Solar-1 and the 45MW wind power plant being run by First wind power plant LTD. First, the solar station is a good example for Samruk-Green Energy, as we are teaching and supporting professionals for renewable energy projects. On the other side of Kazakhstan, you find some regions—especially in the south and west—which have the budget to finance 1MW of solar power plants. The state authorities that are presenting tenders come to our 2MW station to learn how to avoid mistakes on the design, construction, and operation of the plant. We show them how to optimize the time and resources necessary for the future development of solar plants. There is also news about the energy storage systems because Samruk-Energy has an Agreement on Strategic Partnership with the American company Primus Power. Primus Power is based in California and uses Zinc-Bromide technology for industrial purposes. Flow technology is for batteries, and these materials can be developed in Kazakhstan. We have an agreement with Primus Power to use our 2MW SPP for testing. We also defined a place for the installation of a new device, which will be brought in from the US at the end of this year, so we can test and compare in real life situations. This is a new market, and we are going to be the first company in Eurasia to test this technology.</p><h4>How will Samruk-Green Energy help to achieve the target growth of renewable energy dependence in Kazakhstan from less than 1% today to 10% by 2030?</h4><p>Kazakhstan will attain 10% by 2030 because our President and the government are fully behind the green economy. The aim is to reach 3% by 2020, 10% by 2030, and up to 50% by 2050 out of all consumed electricity in the county. This is achievable, as right now for our 2020 goal we have 3% regeneration of total consumption of electricity for renewables. We send our projects to our system operator for approval, and they maintain the stability of our national grid. It is encouraging that green energy is growing in popularity, and there are companies and resources yet to develop it, along with support from financial institution such as EBRD. In addition to these projects, we need to ensure the stability of the national grid because it will increase the capability of renewables, as they depend on wind, sun, and other uncontrollable factors.</p><h4>Do you expect that Expo 2017 will substantially affect international awareness of Kazakhstan's potential for renewables?</h4><p>For years, we have been generating experience and education regarding power and technology. The year 2017 will be the point when everything we have generated will reach the next level. Kazakhstani companies will then be able to compete in the world market for solar energy, and they will be ready to start to compete with the major global brands or develop bilateral agreements between Kazakhstan and other countries to exchange technologies.</p><h4>How important is it to continue attracting foreign companies and partner with multinational institutions to develop solar opportunities?</h4><p>Financial institutions like EBRD have smart money and good terms for loans. For example, we signed a loan agreement with ERBD last year, with 20% of the amount from the clean technology fund (CTF). It gave us a 1.5% interest rate for 20 years. Approximately 80% was in tenge, with a very good interest rate. It was mandated that the feasibility study be rechecked by an international engineering team, so that the impact on the environment could be proved by international ecological consulting companies. This means it brought more to the project—not only money, but also the know-how to make the project even more stable and with increased long-term efficiency.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>My expectation is that the current construction work will be finished on time and forge a legacy for Kazakhstan. These developments will have a meaningful impact on the local population in terms of generating demand for roads, buildings, and culture. The Expo will be held to high standards and, thanks to this exhibition, we will have some internal resources and external support from the consulting, finance, and engineering companies to develop the correct projects for the future. We plan to increase output up to 100MW, and by 2017 we hope to have a 50MW solar power plant for electricity generation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the major achievements of the University since its establishment?</h4><p>Rather than pinpointing one specific achievement, I believe we have shown balanced growth and positive overall development. We started operations in 2012 with three undergraduate programs and we have come a long way within a span of less than four years. Currently, we are offering 11 different majors at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including a Master of Business Administration and a Master of Law. We have been growing organically, attracting top class faculty members from all over the world. Today, we can boast of a culturally diverse campus environment with students hailing from 40 different nationalities.</p><h4>Which ones of your programs have seen the highest demand?</h4><p>We make sure that we offer programs that are job centric and driven by market demand, hence all our programs have been successful to date. While on one hand there is a substantial demand for academic degrees that are relevant to the government sector among the Emirati population, on the other hand the business administration program is excessively popular among our expatriate students.</p><h4>Are you planning on launching any new programs?</h4><p>Yes, we recently launched our MBA program with five specializations and a Master of Law program with majors in Public and Private Law. We plan to expand our program portfolio in 2016-17 by further diversifying it. We have plans for offering courses in IT and Software Engineering along with some other majors. We launch each program after conducting a thorough feasibility study and assessing job market trends and demand for programs.</p><h4>What is the University's internationalization strategy?</h4><p>At City University College of Ajman we offer an environment that is conducive to the growth of a diversified student population. As I said, we have students from 40 different nationalities and it is a true reflection of the overall UAE society, which is very international and diverse. We are attracting students not only from the expat community within the UAE, but also directly from various countries, specifically Asia and Africa. To support the internationalization of the College, we have formed several international alliances that include an articulation agreement with Mantissa College, Malaysia, whereby our students can complete the final two years of their Bachelor's program at the said university. We also have an agreement with the International Students Exchange Program (ISEP), an entity based in Washington, DC with 300 partner universities worldwide. The agreement with ISEP gives our students a chance to gain international exposure by studying abroad for one or two semesters, at any of the partner universities under stipulated guidelines. We are among the few universities in the UAE affiliated with ISEP.</p><h4>In what ways is City University College of Ajman fermenting relationships between academia and work experience?</h4><p>We have many faculty members who carry industry experience along with impressive academic profiles. They impart their knowledge and expertise in the classroom by using industry-specific information and real-life case studies, which give our students an extra edge. We strongly believe that in order to make them into competent, well-rounded professionals we must ensure that our students have firsthand experience of their chosen career paths. To give you an example, we have a partnership with R Hotels, the hospitality division of R Holding. Students from our Hospitality and Tourism Management Program can avail internship opportunities at any hotel under the R-Hotels group, gaining experience in all departments from Housekeeping and Front Office to IT and Revenue Management. It enables them to get a better feel of a live working environment in the hospitality sector. We plan to replicate such partnerships with companies relevant to the other programs as well, enabling our students to experience more real life scenarios and to shape them into suitable candidates for employment at the companies they intern at.</p><h4>How is City University College of Ajman helping develop higher education in Ajman?</h4><p>Ajman has always been a preferred destination for higher education. With institutions like the Ajman University, the biggest private University in UAE, and Thumbay Group's Gulf Medical College, Ajman has always attracted students not only from all over UAE but from the rest of the region as well. City University College of Ajman, though relatively new on the scene, is still playing a significant role in the development of higher education in the Emirate. We do not to compromise on the quality of our programs or our faculty. We currently have students coming from all seven Emirates, as well as different parts of the world. To ensure that we include all tiers of society, we offer various grants, allowances, and work-study opportunities under the Sheikh Rashid Bin Humaid Scholarship Program.</p><h4>In what areas will you be investing your resources?</h4><p>We are in the process of building a new purpose-built campus. The investment is going to be about AED100 million. Construction will start by the end of this year and, after completion of the first phase, the campus will accommodate approximately 7,000 students. We also plan to invest in Research and Development activities, along with improving student facilities and augmenting the overall level of institutional effectiveness.</p><h4>How will higher education evolve in the next five years?</h4><p>In the last decade or so, higher education in the UAE has undergone a rapid transformation. The credit goes to the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research (MOHESR) of the UAE. They have done a tremendous job in shaping up and laying down the framework for higher education in the country. I strongly believe the sector will grow further in the next few years. We can expect to see the UAE as a destination of choice for higher education regionally and internationally.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Over & Above]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[over-above]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the defining events in the evolution of Global since it was established in 1998?</h4><p>It's been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride for us. When we were established in 1998, when oil was at around $8. We shot up like a rocket during the first 10 years of our inception. We understood that the capital markets in Kuwait lacked certain products and services and we capitalized on that. We entered a boom market phase between 2002 and 2007, which gave us the headwind we needed to grow. We started Global with a capital of $50 million in 1998 and, by mid 2008, we were trading at a $5 billion market cap. We expanded our offices to cover Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Oman, and even had investments in Palestine. The financial crisis was the first real challenge for us and, as we witnessed, when the US sneezes, the whole world catches a cold. Asset liability management became a major challenge as well. We were only 1-to-1 leveraged at the time, but in less than 12 months we were leveraged at more than 12-to-1. We chose to be completely transparent with our clients, shareholders, and regulators throughout it all. This approach was unique in a culture that generally conceals problems, but we stuck to our commitment to being honest. I'm proud of what Global has done. With the restructuring agreement we signed in 2012, the company is now well capitalized, totally debt-free, and profitable. Dividends are being distributed and business is growing.</p><h4>What is your current strategy to leverage Global's position moving forward?</h4><p>Although Global is extremely liquid, with more than 45% of our balance sheet in cash, we are not too keen on taking risk with our capital. We would like to use our liquidity to strengthen the fee business, and either co-investing in the products that we launch side by side with our clients, or through approaching opportunities for inorganic growth. Our earnings will be completely different from what we had before; it's no longer about how much you make but about the quality of your earnings which provides sustainability and better valuation. After all we have been through, most shareholders are very risk averse and very sensitive to taking chances. The environment in general is still volatile. Therefore, we opt to be risk-averse at this time.</p><h4>What expertise does Global provide investors looking for a local partner within the GCC and MENA region?</h4><p>We are focused on our asset management business and on investment banking opportunities. First off, in investment banking, with our regional footprint, we create a strong bridge connecting buyers and sellers across the region. This is where we can really add value. Many investment houses offer similar expertise and experience in financial engineering and technical sides of the business, but our regional footprint, insight and placement power gives us an edge. Since their inclusion in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, Qatar and the UAE have brought a lot of investor attention to the region and we hope other GCC countries, particularly Kuwait, can also follow suit. That would open windows of opportunity in the asset management business to develop more products for investors that are keen to find local partners who understand the market, not only on the large-cap level but also on the mid-cap and small-cap levels.</p><h4>What kinds of new asset management products is Global pioneering in the region?</h4><p>We offer MENA Equities Asset Management products, which include everything on the public market from Islamic, conventional, indexed, or oil-related business. Our funds and portfolios have been outperforming benchmarks and peers for years now, so they have really developed their track record. On the international asset management level, we play more of an advisory role, investing in human capital, software, and systems that enable us to filter international opportunities through international managers, which we then share with our clients. We also offer cash management services, real estate asset management, and private equity. We've launched a lot of private equity funds since our inception in the range of billions of dollars, and we were able to distribute hundreds of millions of dollars back to investors. We are in the process of launching two new products. One is a fund to invest in secondary private equity funds in the region. The other is a healthcare platform, which will be a vehicle for investors to take advantage of what we have to offer in the healthcare domain at the GCC-MENA-Turkey level. We create synergies where we feel there is opportunity. Moving forward, Saudi Arabia and Turkey will be very exciting to watch.</p><h4>As a leading Kuwait-based investment company, what role do you see Global playing in terms of improving the business environment and contributing to the local society in Kuwait?</h4><p>Our corporate social responsibility strategy focuses on two major segments; women and young people. Kuwait has always been a pioneer in supporting women and we at Global have a lot of women in senior positions. We have held a lot of seminars on women in investment, training, and promotion of women's empowerment. In complement to the national vision of Kuwait, we also feel strongly about the need to support the emergence of entrepreneurs and small businesses. We feel the frustration of young people in trying to fulfill their dreams. There's a lot we need to think about to support small enterprises. We are hoping that we can work with the Kuwait National Fund for SMEs Development; the $2 billion fund that has been created by the government to support young people.</p><h4>Considering Kuwait's economy as a whole in the context of the low oil prices that we're seeing, how can the investment sector play a more active role in supporting the diversification of Kuwait's economy?</h4><p>The Kuwaiti government has been pushing ahead reforms to enhance the business environment in the country and accordingly diversify the economy. The Capital Markets Authority was established under Law No (7) in the year 2010, the new company law was passed in 2012 to replace the previous law of 1960, and laws pertaining to public-private partnerships (PPP), foreign direct investment (FDI), and small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) were also introduced. The largest contributor to non-oil GDP has always been the financial sector. With the enhanced business environment, investment-banking services will be highly required and Kuwaiti investment banks will be major players in the market. On the other hand, with the country having a lot of wealth in liquidity and the experience and track record of Kuwaiti asset managers, Kuwait could become the asset management hub of the region.</p><h4>Kuwait is well known for its investment outflows, but in terms of attracting investors to Kuwait, what opportunities exist here and how can Kuwait create a more attractive environment for foreign investment?</h4><p>There are a lot of things we can do, especially with the recent reforms mentioned earlier. The retail market promises a lot of growth potential considering the demographics on the consumer-side, the strong inflow of expats, and the growing entrepreneurial spirit among SMEs in Kuwait contributing to the consumer goods and retail market in the country. There's a lot of potential in the healthcare and educational sectors, as well. These sectors still hold a lot of value for investors in Kuwait. Then of course everything related to oil and gas, petrochemicals, and alternative energy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Everything we talk about economically for 2016 hinges on what happens geopolitically, unfortunately. The developments with Iran may lead to further uncertainty in the region and markets don't expect a rise in oil prices to hit the $70-$100 dollar range, but will be somewhere between $30-$50 a barrel. I hope GCC governments tackle the challenge that a reduction in oil prices will continue to have on their budget surpluses, and moving towards a budget deficit, which could be a potential for the GCC government and corporate debt market in meeting the fiscal spending and the development plans that the government continues to commit to in the coming few years. Over and above that, we will continue to offer ideas in defensive sectors such as health and education, amongst others.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the contribution of Cimentos de Moçambique to the local economy?</h4><p>We employee about 1,200 people, half of whom are directly employed and the other half indirectly. Last year, our production stood at around 1.5 million tons of cement and clinker, somewhat below our total production capacity. There are a number of factors, namely the reliability of the electricity supply, railroad service, and other crucial supplies. The company's good relation with the Mozambican government allows it to search for timely and useful solutions for the problems encountered. However, the issue of electricity is universal and a considerable problem. For example, in January there was a blackout in the north for 28 days, so two plants stopped production. Sometimes it is not the lack of electricity, but its quality of output. If there is an unstable flow, we have to stop our machines, as the engines could catch on fire.</p><h4>How can these challenges be overcome in the medium term?</h4><p>Investment in the industry sector is paramount, from the both state and private sector. For example in terms of electricity infrastructure, there are a lot of private companies interested in building power plants here in Mozambique, but the government should be practical and work to help investors. Without electricity, industry cannot stabilize, which greatly affects the cost of production of cement. Although our plants are capable of working for 24 hours, if there is no electricity for two hours, we have to stop for four hours because it takes time to power down and then restart the plant. The lack of reliable electricity affects us in terms of availability and maintenance problems. Another example is the problems we, as well as other industrial companies, face in the logistics area. Although we are the only clinker producer in Mozambique we also need to import it. If the ships are destined for the central region of Mozambique (via Beira Port), the ships must sometimes first anchor in Nacala, or Maputo, as they cannot go to Beira since it lacks the capacity. Given the lack of port capacity for the country's imports and exports, sometimes ships have to dock for several days to discharge. These examples take their toll on cement production costs, while leading to higher national cement prices.</p><h4>Cimentos de Moçambique has recently announced plans to invest $250 million in a new integrated cement plant in Nacala. What is the strategy behind this step?</h4><p>That is part of our vision for Mozambique, and our view is supported by figures from the rest of the world. We consider economic estimates that imply that profits from gas will rise, while the population will grow and GDP per capita will double. Considering not only the country's needs for infrastructure, but also the lack of housing, if people have more money in their pockets, they will buy more cement. In Mozambique, 80% of the cement we sell is used directly by individuals to improve their residences. That is the main market we are working in; not for big companies or construction, but for people who buy cement for home use. We believe in the potential of Mozambique. Presently we have a around 60% market share in Mozambique, and although in the coming years there may be some newcomers, we believe Cimentos de Moçambique will sustain this figure. For that we are improving our portfolio with our new plant in Nacala, making a number of management measures, not only on the commercial side, but also on production. Regarding the Nacala investment, we have a number of competitive advantages for that location, namely the present grinding operation on the location, the limestone reserves, which is critical, the land, and the commercial implantations and know-how.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the regulatory environment in the construction industry?</h4><p>Presently and historically our main competitor imported cement; however, some of the materials imported are not suitable for construction and some of the cement does not even meet the minimum requirements of the law. Moreover, compliance with existing regualtion is poor. Cimentos de Moçambique believes it is of the upmost importance to have a strong industrial sector, and this is something we are working to create together with the Mozambican Association of Cement Suppliers. We are combining forces to work hand in hand with the government to increase competition and product quality. We are working on different fronts, but doing that here is not easy. It is a step-by-step process.</p><h4>What is your global vision?</h4><p>Cimentos de Moçambique is a member of InterCement. InterCement is one of the largest and most profitable international cement producers in the world, with a diversified geographic footprint in Mozambique, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Portugal, Egypt, Cape Verde, and South Africa. Although Cimentos de Moçambique is a part of one of the largest cement companies in the world, for us it is important to maintain high levels of profitability because, without that, it would be impossible to achieve our investment objectives. Without profitability, we could not invest. It is important for us to be profitable to increase our operations, build more plants, pay more taxes, and pay our employees better.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With its two institutes and two universities, what role does Laureate play in the higher education system here in Peru?</h4><p>We are now one of the biggest educational groups in Peru with 100,000 students enrolled in our institutions, UPC, UPN, CIBERTEC, and ITN. Yet, when you look at the overall higher education market, we make up less than 10% of private enrolment. There are 1.5 million students at the tertiary level nationwide, albeit the private education systems slightly less than a million. We entered the sector in 1983 with CIBERTEC as pioneers in IT training and education in Peru. To this day, we remain one of the most prestigious institutes specializing in technology, although we have successfully introduced programs in the areas of business and design. Technology, so to speak, remains the common denominator. As a group of higher education institutions, we have always pursued a dynamic academic model characterized by innovation. We were the first to offer an undergraduate focused in the music and in the fashion industries (UPC).</p><h4>What innovations are you exploring to integrate technology into the educational experience, particularly at UPC?</h4><p>At UPC, we are developing a new model; the country's first digital university. We aim to find new ways to deliver higher education. We will strive to become a leading university in the use of technology in the classroom. The delivery of education needs to be more accessible to students with different needs. The higher education industry is evolving, and we believe in being bold in our stance. We are currently in the design and pilot phase of the digital model. We have already started by encouraging our students and faculty to leverage such technology as smartphones and tablets in the learning environment.</p><h4>What role can the private sector play in increasing access to higher education for people of lower income in Peru?</h4><p>UPN is keen to make higher education more affordable for a large underserved market that has long lacked access to education. This is vital for the future of a developing country like Peru. In this country, participation in higher education remains low. We have come a long way over the past 15 years; only three out of 10 students leaving school today have access to higher education. We need to push for a 50-60% participation rate. There are those who dismiss the key role of private education in society arguing that education should be free and guided by the state. I myself have been engaged in this debate throughout my professional life of over 30 years. Today, when we look at Peru, we find that private education accounts for 70% of enrolment. Had we not secured private investment in the education system over the past 10 years, we would be in a critical situation, lacking the required pool of professionals that Peru's development requires. And so private education has played a major role in providing higher education to more and more people in Peru.</p><h4>Do you think the reform of university regulations to improve low-quality private institutions has been positive for Peruvian education?</h4><p>The issue of quality is a separate issue from whether a school is a public or private institution. There are good and bad quality institutions in the public and private sectors. The students' best interests have to be at the center of the debate. Both public and private institutions need to manage their financial resources effectively and efficiently in order to invest in better infrastructure and academic quality. I can understand why there has been pressure for new laws and regulations regarding higher education in Peru. When you look at this sector, sure, some bad institutions do not focus on the best interests of their students. This is a very asymmetric sector where the student has a limited ability to decide where and what to study. Effective regulation must be built on setting reasonable, minimum, or baseline standards focused on the outcomes (employability) of institutions rather than just the process (percentage fulltime faculty). My concern is that the regulatory body, SUNEDU, may become highly bureaucratic, led by people with traditional paradigms and set in the ways of the past. Too much regulation is the best way to stifle innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you evaluate the financial performance of Global Investment Holdings in 2014?</h4><p>We did well because we expanded internationally, adding five new international ports to our portfolio and becoming the largest cruise port operator in the world. We also more than doubled our compressed natural gas business, which is now ready to embark on international expansion. We have also sown the seeds of future growth by completing value-enhancing investments in our mining business, which will move us up the value chain.</p><h4>How can Turkey collaborate with a slow EU economy?</h4><p>EU countries will remain Turkey's top international trade and investment partners for decades to come. Despite political ups and downs, the levels of collaboration have steadily increased. In terms of defense, we have been together in NATO for more than 50 years. There are also numerous areas in foreign policy, counter-terrorism, and immigration where Turkey and the EU are consistently cooperating. Over the past decade, Turkey has also adopted many of the standards and best practice criteria in EU legislation known as the acquis communautaire. Yet today, we recognize that there are two major issues. The first is that Turkey's accession negotiations have stalled. And secondly, the EU is in a serious economic crisis, which is in the process of spreading to Turkey. I will leave politics to the policy makers on both sides, but in terms of business I see a strong role for EU-Turkey cooperation, especially during these troubled times. I believe that the EU-Turkey trade relationship can be deepened by including construction services, agricultural products, free trade with third countries (especially with NAFTA), and increased visa-free mobility for Turkish citizens and vehicles into the current Customs Union framework. I see four areas of natural advantage that should be built on. With an advantaged energy supply position, low real interest rates, and a young, productive, and competitive labor force, Turkey can become a base for EU companies to manufacture energy-intensive products. Secondly, Turkey's proximity to the EU and strong logistics fleets also mean our country can expand its role as the flexible and quick top-up producer in the value chain, e.g. for textiles or auto parts. Then, in neighboring developing markets, Turkish companies offer a distinctive product and service mix that can be a real alternative to the EU's often over-engineered and over-priced product/service mix. This offers grounds for EU companies to use Turkey as a launch pad to grow in third countries. Finally, Turkey is on its way to becoming a world-class hub for natural gas and for passenger air traffic.</p><h4>What is the reason behind the strong interest in Turkey as an investment destination?</h4><p>Turkey is an attractive large market, centrally positioned, with business-friendly legislation, a growing middle-class consumer base, and consistent growth. Yet today, much of the interest also stems from the fact that international investment yields are close to zero, and the loose monetary policies in large OECD countries mean that there is excessive money in the market. This era is fast coming to an end; therefore, the level of interest in Turkey is not likely to remain constant. I believe we have to succeed in completely reforming our legal system. With that and other reforms announced by the prime minister, there is no doubt in my mind that Turkey will rank as one of the most attractive emerging markets to invest in for the next decade.</p><h4>How do you envision Turkey's economic future?</h4><p>If Turkey can stay on its current course for another decade—and I am confident that it will—the future of the country will be very bright.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the overall strategy of Katara Hospitality?</h4><p>With 45 years of experience as an international hotel owner, developer, and operator, Katara Hospitality has always been at the forefront of the industry. Our goal is to leave an outstanding legacy for the future generations and to use our resources and expertise to invest in heritage properties around the world, each of which represents both a legacy and a future. Following the success we have achieved in 2014 and throughout 2015, we are now focusing on our next strategic target of expanding our portfolio of iconic hotels to 60 properties by 2026. We take immense pride and pleasure in rejuvenating historically iconic hotels, restoring them to their former glory, and ensuring their hospitality heritage is secured. One of our foremost priorities is ensuring maximum possible returns for a wide range of stakeholders; investors, operating partners, employees, and the guests at our hotels. This strategy has positioned us as an international forerunner in the hospitality sector, and earned us recognition as an organization that is pushing the boundaries of industry excellence.</p><h4>How do you balance international expansion with domestic expansion?</h4><p>We are very focused on international expansion. Simultaneously, however, we intend to maintain our position as a market leader in Qatar, while encouraging private investors to participate in building a solid hospitality network within the country. We are always looking to invest in a collection of unique properties in key sought-after international locations while partnering with some of the world's finest hotel brands, ensuring they are aligned with our ethos and brand values. We acquire and further invest in properties that have set the standards in the industry, as we work to create an enviable portfolio of iconic hotels around the globe.</p><h4>What regions of the world are of major focus for expansion for Katara Hospitality and how does this reflect the macroeconomic conditions affecting these international regions?</h4><p>Europe remains a key part of our focused international expansion. Our European presence continues to be strong and next year will see the opening of several iconic hotels. With properties in UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, we expect to invest in other markets in the Mediterranean countries. North America is also a possibility and we intend to further expand in Asia. The year 2015, we added The Westin Excelsior Rome, The Peninsula Paris and Excelsior Hotel Gallia, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Milan to our global portfolio, which brings us to a total of 35 properties in operation or under development.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recent opening of Katara Hospitality's Peninsula Hotel Paris to the overall growth of the company?</h4><p>The Peninsula Paris is an iconic property, not just in Paris but globally and is an asset to our growing portfolio. The opening is hugely significant for us as the property offers the quintessence of the French culture with state-of-the art services in iconic locations. Our guests visiting us from Middle East are very interested in cultural as well as historical heritage and look today for a holistic experience with tailored services in the most exclusive locations. France is renowned for its cultural heritage and has given the world fabulous cuisine, amazing artists, unique fashion trends, and memorable monuments. Middle East travelers appreciate this subtle mix of history, “Art de Vivre," and luxury sophistication, which cannot be found anywhere else in the world. Europe on the whole has strong appeal as an aspirational holiday destination for travelers owing to the diverse and high quality of its tourism offering with the added appeal of cross-country travel. This is why Europe is a key focus for our international growth and The Peninsular Paris is a key property in our expansion journey.</p><h4>What does this say about Katara Hospitality's ability to acquire key real estate and landmark buildings internationally and the company's attitude toward the local community?</h4><p>Katara Hospitality invests in heritage properties that have set the standards in the industry worldwide. Our aim is to develop a portfolio of exceptional properties that are celebrated hospitality icons in key global markets. We aspire to create exceptional legacies that are aligned with our commitment to preserving heritage. We take immense pride and enjoy the challenge of converting buildings that carry history into splendid hospitality complexes. Our focus is not limited to acquiring iconic hotels; we also create hospitality icons by turning assets that were designed for other purposes into true hospitality gems. The Tazi Palace in Tangier, for example, was originally designed to become a royal residence and will be transformed into a luxurious palace hotel. A beautiful palace hotel will be created within the building shell and an extension has been tastefully added to complement the historic building refurbishment. We always ensure that we are respectful to local communities. We do this by preserving the heritage of these properties rather than re-inventing the wheel, so that they can remain very much part of local heritage.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are well positioned for another successful year as we now focus on our next strategic target of expanding our portfolio of iconic hotels. We will continue with our expansion in some of the world's leading international destinations, while also further strengthening our footprint in Qatar. In Qatar, we are currently building the iconic Katara Towers in Doha's up-and-coming Lusail Marina District. An architectural translation of Qatar's country seal, the hospitality complex will host a five-star luxury hotel, a five-star ultra-luxury hotel, and branded apartments. The property, expected to open in 2018, will also offer facilities such as a man-made satellite beachfront island. As we expand the operator side of our business, we will open seven new hotels that are currently in the final stages of development. The recently launched Murwab Hotel Group, our standalone operations arm headquartered in Qatar, will become a key focus for our organization over the coming months alongside our core business of hotel asset management.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges faced by investors coming to Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is an emerging market with many attractions, but there are also some difficulties due to instability in the region. Other issues are law enforcement and transparency, which are critical determinants for investment. Reforms are needed to fight corruption, increase transparency, and tackle the unregulated gray economy. Court procedures in Turkey can also take long time. On the plus side, Turkey is a base for the delivery of products and services, with its location serving as a gateway between Europe and Asia. Efforts to be attuned to the EU are an important factor attracting investors. Furthermore, according to OECD, the country is expected to become the second fastest growing country as of 2018. Investors may benefit from Turkish partners that have access throughout Asia, the Caucasus, and the MENA region. Another advantage is that the Turkish population is a consumerist middle class growing steadily. </p><h4>What is the timing like for mergers and acquisitions in Turkey at the moment?</h4><p>Mergers and acquisitions are continuing, though not at as high a level as in 2010-11. The New Commercial Code provided improvements to the procedure of M&amp;As. Considering the facts that European business ethics and modern management practices are implemented and use of English is increasing; I believe there will be more large M&amp;As. </p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey is an investor-friendly environment. It has become an energy hub, and is amongst the important players in oil and gas in the region. The government also supports investments in the renewable energy. Other booming businesses are IT, real estate, and construction. I would tell foreign investors to do due diligence before investing. Turkish companies are generally family businesses, so there may be issues concerning professionalism, and Turkish parties do not like any surprises; it is important to lay everything out before proceeding. I advise entrepreneurs to work with legal and tax professionals from the very first stages.</p><h4>How would you assess the Turkish legal framework for foreign investors?</h4><p>Legislation for foreign investment complies with international standards. Turkey is a party to organizations such as G-20, OECD, ILO, WTO, IMF, and several international contracts, and tax treaties. Foreign legal persons can be founders and shareholders of companies. The New Commercial Code accelerated the restructuring of companies to international standards. <br>Istanbul has always been a commercial center. But it is time to consider other cities in Anatolia, Black Sea, and Mediterranean. The government is offering new incentives when investing in the East and Southeast. I can sincerely advise to investors to enter into  the Turkish market. Our target is to stand as a “one-stop shop,“ by serving as a connection point between investors and all authorities in the process.</p><h4>What competitive advantages does Ketenci &amp; Ketenci bring to the legal services market?</h4><p>We advise investors from Europe and the US, mostly Fortune 500 companies. We provide crystal clear and comprehensive legal advice to foreign investors. With the entry of US law firms, the legal market is expanding in Turkey. We work closely with international law firms, with affiliated offices in New York, London, and Milan. As for the difference we make; we guide our clients to understand the economics and business culture here. We keep our clients informed at all stages, assist them to take business decisions, and provide additional services on accountancy and tax.  Litigation and dispute resolution procedures are also important. Owing to our full-service structure, our clients are ensured that they have a reliable contact. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you consider to be Trakhees' most important achievement since its establishment seven years ago?</h4><p>Trakhees' most important achievement is that we have already put our footprint in Dubai's Special Development Zone (SDZ). Prior to that there was no such thing as an SDZ here; everything was under the Dubai local government, but to distinguish these areas and to support the real estate investment and master developers, a decree was issued in 2009 by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Ruler of Dubai, assigning the Ports, Customs &amp; Free Zone Corporation and its companies with its jurisdiction areas identified as a special development zone with its own rules and regulations. The SDZ enjoys certain features and facilities that are not available in Dubai, including a form of Free Zone Companies. Trakhees has set up policies, processes, and procedures that encourage investment in the SDZ. We have created a substantial base for investment in Dubai, of course with the support of the master developers that have created the construction and real estate aspects, including the iconic Palm Jumeirah, Palm Jebel Ali, Discovery Gardens, Deira Islands, the International City, and Al Furjan, which is under Nakheel as well as other developers such as Jumaira Real Estate, Limitless, and DMC. These are some of the many development areas that have created, to a large extent, the image of Dubai.</p><h4>Trakhees' mission is to provide state-of-the-art support and the development services needed to enhance and ease the investment process. What would be your assessment of the opportunities for investors now in Dubai?</h4><p>The government of Dubai has put in considerable effort and has overcome the negative effects of the 2008-09 recession period and the subsequent freeze in activity. Dubai has a commercial center that works well and, as a result, Dubai has managed to create and maintain investor confidence. The most important value-add that Dubai can offer investors is facilitating processes and procedures and quality of service because time is crucial for investors. Furthermore, entities are approachable and supportive in Dubai. One of the main values for Trakhees is to have happy customers, and we always working hard to understand our valuable customer expectations and trying our best to exceed them. We are always accessible and our customers appreciate the smooth and seamless flow of any transaction and we keep building on this trust toward keeping up with the dynamic system of the city Of Dubai. Also , we are heavily involved in Dubai SMART Gov. initiatives and glad to say that Trakhees was awarded the flag of HH Sheikh Hamdan Bin Mohammed for the SMART Government for year 2014, which was a big boost to continue the successful SMART journey and have a large number of online services now as well as automating the internal process with a one-stop window and multi-skilled staff and a dynamic team.</p><h4>In 2014, Trakhees signed a strategic service-level agreement with the Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA) for the development of residential and civil engineering permits. What is the significance for Trakhees and for Dubai of this agreement?</h4><p>The DMCA is not new to us; it was part of our Group, and we have SLA with them in managing the activities of civil engineering activities as well as the environment, health, and safety activates. This signals that people trust us as a service provider. The DMCA has a plan to develop the DMC further and Trakhees is committed to extending its support and facilitation to the success of our sister company DMCA.</p><h4>Even with the current global economic slowdown and low oil prices, Dubai recorded a 3% growth in foreign trade in 1Q2015. His Excellency, Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman of the Ports, Customs, and Free Zone Corporation said, “The Emirate's foreign trade is leveraged by its world-class infrastructure and the trading and customs service put in place to cater to the needs of traders and investors." What is the importance of Trakhees' contribution to the local economy?</h4><p>Trakhees' contribution is highly recognized whether locally of globally; you can see it and feel it. Our contribution will be supported by the development in the SDZ. If you compare 1H2015 with 1H2014, we have witnessed an almost 37% increase in building permits. These permits are for a mixture of new projects and those that were frozen over the last couple of years due to the economic slowdown. This gives an indication that Dubai's economy and investment base is healthy and confidence is strengthening. I am sure this is happening in Dubai in general not just in our SDZ. Developers have restarted work on their sites, including a number of shopping malls and luxurious hotels. In fact, 2014 was also a good year with a 16% increase over 2013 for building permits.</p><h4>What do you expect from 2016?</h4><p>I always see trade going north for Dubai, and it will never go below double digits. I think we will see at least a 12-13% increase in 2016. In 2015 we have worked a very optimistic budget and we have even gone beyond that in terms of both revenue and the number of transactions.</p><h4>Do you see growth in 2016 being in a specific area, such as construction?</h4><p>Based on the demand and available supply, and sensing the market, I think the trend will continue and construction will be number one, and retail as well. A good number of projects within the SDZ are due to open by 4Q2015, and also during 1Q2016.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the progress that Mozambique has made in terms of improving the ease of doing business over the past five years?</h4><p>Today, Mozambique means business for various reasons, the most important one being the culture of peace and stability arising from the ability and openness to dialogue between our government and society in general. There is little one can do without peace and stability. These two factors have been at the core of the day-to-day management of our nation. The second key element is the creation of adequate logistics infrastructure. This means building roads, bridges, energy, and water supply networks, ports and railways, and telecommunications. Mozambique can boast of having a modern and competitive logistics infrastructure. The key ports of Maputo, Beira, and Nacala are already playing a crucial role in domestic and regional trade linking neighboring states to the Indian Ocean by road and rail. The main north-south highway continues to assume its role as the backbone of the economy, airports have been refurbished, and new ones have been built. The largest of the new airports is the Nacala International Airport which was recently inaugurated, making it easier to connect travelers from different parts of the country without having to go through South Africa. The third element is of course the bureaucracy involved in the establishment and running of a business. By various metrics, including the World Bank Doing Business report, Mozambique has made tremendous progress. In Doing Business 2015, Mozambique climbed 15 steps compared to 2014, bringing the country to the 127th position, in contrast with the 142nd place it occupied in the previous year. The World Bank highlights progress in areas such as property registration, availability of credit, and resolving insolvency as areas with the most significant improvement. The process of company incorporation has been simplified over the years. Today, you can complete all the necessary steps in a matter of just a couple of days provided that the investor presents all the required documentation. It is far simpler today than it was 10 years ago.</p><h4>How would you describe the role that foreign financed megaprojects play in Mozambique's economic growth?</h4><p>Megaprojects play a major role in Mozambique's economy by boosting national production and exports and by creating jobs, both directly and indirectly. Indirect jobs appear as a consequence of many small and medium scale enterprises that emerge as suppliers of goods and services for these megaprojects.</p><h4>Unsatisfied energy demands and limited access to electricity remain a concern in Mozambique. What role can foreign investment play within that sector?</h4><p>As you may be aware, Mozambique is blessed with enormous energy potential, which exceeds 18,000MW when considering water, gas, coal, solar, and wind sources. The country desperately needs investment in this sector in order to satisfy growing demand from both domestic and international industrialization. Of this potential, Mozambique generates less than 3,000MW.</p><h4>What is CPI's strategy to attract medium-sized international businesses and how do you envision their role in the further development of Mozambique?</h4><p>CPI will continue to play a role in attracting and more importantly retaining private investment in Mozambique through our various platforms. We also provide institutional assistance to investors from project inception to implementation. Substantial fiscal incentives are also provided under the Investment Law for investors in the different geographic regions of the country. The government has also established special economic zones throughout the country where investors can enjoy special fiscal benefits. These zones include the Beluluane Industrial Park, which is home to one of the largest aluminum smelters in the southern African region (MOZAL), Beira Mungassa in the central province of Sofala, and the Nacala Special Economic Zone in the northern province of Nampula. We also have what we call Rapid Development Zones for investments in agriculture, agro-industry, industry, tourism, lumbering, and other sectors that, according to feasibility studies, can bring high returns. These include the Zambezi Valley, an extensive area covering several provinces in the center, and Niassa Province in northern Mozambique.</p><h4>What can be done to transform the agricultural sector from subsistence farming to a more efficient and productive agro-industry?</h4><p>Agriculture is one of the most important sectors in Mozambique due to its potential in terms of availability of arable land—currently estimated at 35 million ha—a tropical climate, and abundant and competitive labor. Agriculture has had major impact in the economy through the production of various cash crops such as cotton, tobacco, sugar cane, soy beans, and others, as well as strategic food crops such as maize, rice, and different vegetables and fruits. We need more investment in order to boost this strategic sector of the economy, which is also the source of livelihood for about 80% of our population. We need to attract commercial farmers from our region and from other parts of the world who can involve and employ subsistence farmers through various mutually beneficial schemes such as out-grower programs. In this way, the local population is provided with adequate inputs such as tools, seeds, and fertilizers. In fact, Mozambique alone could feed the SADC region and Africa at large with the crops that are unique to the country.</p><h4>What are CPI's goals and expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect more investment at levels that are far higher than last year, as well as the implementation of a large number of projects that have been already been approved in areas such as logistics, mineral resources, and energy. In 2014 alone, we approved about 500 projects with a total value of $7 billion. We also expect to have more Mozambicans trained in different strategic areas such as oil and gas, geology, and mining. These are some of the sectors in which we still lack human capital. In terms of direct CPI goals, we hope to expand or consolidate our presence within the country and abroad in order to further facilitate the investment approval processes. We also hope to see expanded collaborations with the different institutions involved in the process of investment project approval so that the process can be much faster.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-whole-other-level]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you see the American Hospital positioning itself within Turkey's healthcare sector?</h4><p>Since 2000, the healthcare sector in Turkey has been rapidly getting bigger, but the majority of the hospitals—around 75-80%—belong to the Ministry of Health or have a contract with the social security institution (SGK) in Turkey. The private hospitals make up around 30% of the whole sector. Even the private hospitals have a contract with SGK, so around 95% of all hospitals in Turkey have such a contract. Among all of the hospitals in Turkey, we are one of the very few without a contract with SGK. The private hospitals still make that contract because it is their safety net. The GDP and healthcare spending ratio has been increasing. Even the private hospitals rely too much on SGK, and that's why the spending on healthcare is increasing. It will become intolerable because the government has been trying to make sure that everyone is covered. I'm not sure to what extent the system will be sustainable. The private hospitals, even though they work with SGK, still try to charge the patients much more than just the copay. This is obviously illegal, but a lot of the hospitals do it. That's why we are trying to make sure we are out of that system as well. On top of SGK, instead of having patients pay in cash, we also have complimentary insurance companies so the patients can be covered by both. This way, they won't have to pay in cash. Generally, our prices are 20% higher than even the most expensive hospitals in Turkey because we recognize and believe that high-quality healthcare is only generated by high-quality human capital, which is even more important than our investments in technology. At just the two hospitals, we have around 3,000 employees already working and one of those hospitals isn't even at 100% operation. That is the standard and that's why our investments and human capital expenses are high, hence why our prices are higher. That's why I place the American Hospital in a different category when I compare the hospitals in Turkey. </p><h4>What is your strategy for this year?</h4><p>Cardiovascular disease will be rising rapidly in the coming 10 years and we have built a new program around this called “Living Heart.“ It will be a very comprehensive program taking care of any patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. We will be replicating what we have already implemented in our cancer program in this Living Heart program, and we have already hired a patient coordinator, nurse navigator, and other support personnel. Instead of going department by department, we have different programs. We are changing the whole system. We are making sure everything comes together and operates as one. We will be adding another service line focused on neurology and spine treatment and more. One by one, we will be building these service lines and programs, making sure we tackle all of the departments and combine them together. Although we acknowledge the fact that this will raise our human resources expenses, we know that it will benefit both the quality and the care that the patients receive in our hospitals. American Hospital was the first hospital in Turkey to build a patient advocacy office and we've always had psychologists there, listening to any complaints. On top of that, we have built another office, the Patient Experience Office. We have hired a physician, a nurse, and a psychologist to work there. We don't only listen and respond to complaints, but even the happiest patients can give feedback. In addition, we're in the process of expanding our partnership with the MD Anderson Cancer Center right now. We are going to become its international association partner. We will not only be running the radiation oncology program, but also expanding all of its know-how to our cancer program. We are the first ones in the region to be partnering up on this. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[You’ve Got Soul]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[youve-got-soul]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of Soul Group?</h4><p>When we first started 12 years ago, my husband and I were both involved in the corporate world, mostly working in marketing, and did not know anything much about the restaurant business; only the marketing side of things, which allowed us to get together an idea, a brand, and a business plan. Importantly, our friends and our bosses in the corporate world were very interested. We offered them small shares; none of them invested too much money, and we diversified the risk and raised the money we needed. It was amazingly helpful, and we agreed that they would be silent partners, but through friendship they became active partners. Everyone had a strength; for example, one had the network, one had a finance background, another had an agency background, and so everyone's energy and know-how came together and that is how Banyan came to be what it is now. I find this a very interesting start up for people who want to do it; it is a creative way of raising money. It was a different approach, and very helpful for us, and Banyan was the first Asian fusion restaurant in Turkey. It was a challenge because people did not know too much about ginger, coriander, and all those ingredients, but it was a learning process for all those people and within a few years more restaurants had opened and the concept became more popular, and not just here. In the last 12 years, Banyan has received 10 awards, the last one being from Trip Advisor; we received an Award of Excellence and are in the top 10% in terms of customer reviews in the world, which is a great honor.What have been your greatest achievements, not only as Banyan, but also as a group?</p><p>When we were creating a concept, the main idea was to fill the space of what was missing in Turkey and see how we could differentiate ourselves, and we follow world trends, especially those in London and New York,and so we went there and looked around to see what was popular and so forth, and we recognized that Asian-fusion was missing in Turkey. So that is how we came up with the concept. In the world, the success of a restaurant typically comes down to the food; it is the number one criteria, followed by location, and we figured that in Turkey it is the other way around, with location being the number one criteria. You have to be either in a very convenient location or a very unique location, and in our case Banyan happens to be at a very unique location in terms of the view. I think the driving success behind Banyan is firstly the location, and secondly the differentiation; we offer food that is not readily available and which is becoming more popular. Thirdly, it is the people. The restaurant sector has a very high turnover of staff, and it is difficult to retain the same faces, but at Banyan, because we come from a corporate background, we brought that culture to the restaurant business, and now the corporate culture is being incorporated into this industry. I think our employees appreciate that approach and they have thanked us by remaining loyal, and most of our employees have been with us from the beginning, which is amazing. They are the key and people associate them more with the restaurant than with us. We are in the business, but not on the stage and many people do not know that we are the owners, because there are concepts in Turkey that are built around the owners, but our concept is built around the food and the ambiance. I find that for my business it is much healthier, because if you are big, you cannot be everywhere anyway. There is a classic saying that you have to be at the restaurant all the time; in our case, we reversed that and, on the contrary, I do not want people to come for me, and that has become a strength because we have very good people who deliver and our clients receive good food and ambiance and that is why they come.</p><h4>How do you translate your motto 'Food for the Soul' into the eating experience?<br></h4><p>We are the Soul Group; we want to build places that enhance your soul through the eating experience, and that is our goal. It is not all about dining out, it is the impression given; the way the food is served and the ambiance. It is all about creating a unique experience that will enhance your soul. One thing in common is the view; we have five places in Istanbul on the Bosphorus, and we do not want to go anywhere that does not have a view; the food is also a very important element of the concept and we always take care with that, the sourcing and the quality, the preparation, and the service. Everything is homemade, even our bread, and we even fly in special cheeses from around the country. For example, we source some cheese from the Ayvalik region, and we also have a farmer in Iznik that provides tomatoes from the mountains, not to mention a farmer in Alaçati that farms baby artichokes, and farmers in Bergama who collect herbs. We also work with people who bring in cheese from around Anatolia. For example, in the winery we have 20 different artisanal cheeses made by different producers, and that also contributes to the theme of food for the soul, because nothing is ordinary, even a cheese platter contains a story. In our case, we are building our strategy on not becoming a chain, which is another trend in Turkey. When we say “Food for the Soul" and you look at enhancing the experience, each location is unique and cannot replicated, and nor should it.</p><h4>How do you market your restaurants in terms of branding to ensure that they are all unique, but consistent within the group?</h4><p>I have a marketing background and I love to talk about it; my partner is also a marketing guru and we love discussing these things. Of course we have an umbrella, a group brand, but we choose to treat every location differently, as if they are competing with each other, so that each becomes unique. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Mexican market developed during your time here?</h4><p>When we first came to this market, it was not very mature, so the challenge was one that most big international companies faced—to increase our presence despite the lack of a formal security sector. At that time, security was just seen as labor. Most companies just hired a few security guards without any larger strategy. Since we acquired Pinkerton in 1999, we have expanded a lot. We have at least doubled our size in that time. And the market and industry have evolved as well. In some segments, the clients have more knowledge and more ideas about how to deal with security. This is still a market with a lot of potential for us and we see it as a bridge to connect our company with the rest of our operations around the world.</p><h4>What role has Securitas played in transforming the private security sector here?</h4><p>We want to educate our clients in order to change the way they look at the security industry. In the end, we need to reinforce our efforts to send the right message to the clients to change their idea on how to implement proper security services. The current challenge is to make security an established profession in Mexico. In many countries, being a security guard is a profession and a formal job, but in Mexico, that is still a challenge. We need to inform the public about the specialized nature of our services. A lot of our competition still comes from the informal sector, so one of our challenges is to demonstrate the benefits of working with a formal security company.</p><h4>What distinguishes Securitas from other international security companies?</h4><p>Our biggest differentiator is our business model. We call it “the Toolbox." That business model is oriented toward our clients and our people. With that model, we are not improvising anything. Our vision also distinguishes us—the vision we for our industry and our people. We want to transform the current services in security solutions. That is not a minor vision; it is a huge vision and we need to do a lot of things for that. The way we provide our services is what differentiates our services from our competitors. In Mexico, we have serious competition. Securitas takes all of our internal processes very seriously. Of these, one of the most important is our hiring and selection process, which is unique in the industry. There are rigorous exams that must be passed in order to become a Securitas guard. That ensures that we are hiring a professional person with a background check, who our clients can rely on for security. Secondly, our knowledge of the industry sets us apart. Internationally, we have expertise in different segments that we can rely on to support our core business here.</p><h4>Can you talk more about “the Toolbox?"</h4><p>The Toolbox is a great business model. If you were an engineer, you would need tools to do your job. Securitas is a company founded on three values: Integrity, Vigilance, and Helpfulness. Our business model is based on that.  For that, our group established some basic tools to provide the fundamental skills and tools to do the job. There are nine tools in the box. Each represents an element of our business. The most important of all is our philosophy and our values. This model gives us the opportunity to make a big difference in Mexico. I doubt that anyone else has this kind of business model in Mexico.</p><h4>How does technology play a role in your business?</h4><p>Technology is essential, and is at the very basis of our vision. If we want to transform the current security services sector, we need to use technology. But, it is not just technology itself, we need to integrate the technology with the right platforms, software, and procedures, in order to transform that. Technology is the foundation of this process. In the end, it is possible to reduce the labor cost while also providing savings for the clients. It is more than just economics—we are providing different services for the clients. They can prevent serious losses using new tools and technology. It is fundamental to use technology in our services. For example, we offer “track and trace" with GPS. This service is totally different than it was in the 1990s or 2000s. It is more flexible, and more achievable for everyone. For many years, we were using just CCTV as a tool for monitoring. Now, technology can give you more advantages. We can integrate CCTV into various platforms, controls, and different tools in one platform and manage it in a different way to provide clients with a range of solutions. Technology is very important right now and our market is demanding different services using technology.</p><h4>What do you see as the biggest challenges right now for Securitas?</h4><p>The base of our services is still people. The labor force can be the biggest challenge right now, especially in the north part of the country near the border, where the manufacturing industry often gets first choice of the most qualified employees. Our other challenge is getting into new segments of the market. The majority of our clients are currently in a few sectors: automotive, manufacturing, education, and logistics. There is a lot of potential in airports, healthcare, logistics, and high rises. The challenge is to convince our clients that we have the specialized training to meet the specific needs of their sector. We have expertise from our work in other countries and we can deliver the best practices as a result.</p><h4>What are your goals for Securitas in the next few years?</h4><p>We still have potential segments for our market. We want to expand our footprint around the country in areas like airports, the healthcare sector, high-rises, and logistics. We will not lose sight of our vision in our approach to those segments. We will maintain our focus to transform the current services into real security solutions in line with the global vision of our CEO, Alf Göransson. These are the next steps for us—trying to educate the market in that way.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has The Abraaj Group taken the Yörsan brand and worked to develop it?</h4><p>Abraaj bought shares in Yörsan and we took over the management of the firm one year ago. Before us, Yörsan was a strong family business. It was already exporting to more than 20 countries in the world. As we took over management affairs, we introduced Yörsan products to our Middle Eastern network. We changed the pack designs and logo in line with the image of Yörsan. We did research everywhere as to what the customers were looking for so we could match their needs. This has already been an enormous job, but it is only the first step. We are aiming to expand our exports five fold, and we want Yörsan to become a global brand. We are working to improve and bring the brand value to the future in the light of the Yörük family's past experiences. We have the widest range of cheese in Turkey, which is attractive for many countries. It is hard to manage such a broad portfolio. While technology is crucial, the people at our production facilities are the backbone of our operations. Our quality is a combination of craftsmanship and modern technology. With this approach, we can manage the complexity of our portfolio. This is a huge advantage for us. We are changing nearly all the layouts, and organized the factory in a more efficient way, in line with global practices. We are flexible, and growing. Yörsan was the fastest growing company in the dairy category this year—more than 38%, while the market grew at just 15%. We became the second largest brand in yogurt in Turkey. Yörsan moved up to third place in cheese sales, and to number one in regional cheese sales. We did all of this in our transitional period. We merged the headquarters, changed the management teams, and grew at the same time. Getting our products on every store shelf is a challenge, and we are still in a developing market. In Europe, supermarkets represent 80% of the market, but in Turkey it's still 50-50. We have more than 160,000 retailers in Turkey. </p><h4>Is there a danger of Turkish consumers becoming so exposed to foreign products that they move away from Turkish goods?</h4><p>We need to be ready for this. In Turkey there is a huge market for traditional products, but it will diminish over time. We will have a balance like in Europe, and we will have more supermarkets. But, in spite of increasing urbanization, Turkish people are still nostalgic. They will pay a premium for traditional goods. That is why I am not concerned for the next 20 years. However, in big cities, young people are always looking for new, Western things. Young adults are important for FMCGs, as they follow—and define—trends. These days, trends are driven by social media, so they move faster. Now, the whole world is connected. When there is a trend in the US or Europe, it immediately comes to Turkey. But, it doesn't always take off. When producers tried to bring the snack-pack yogurts to Turkey, they failed. All of us are trying to be modern, but linked with our traditions and habits.</p><h4>What are your key targets for 2016?</h4><p>We see ourselves as the masters of cheese and yogurt in Turkey. Up to this point, we have maintained a traditional image and social presence. We have not done any advertising on TV, for example. Despite this, we are in second place in yoghurt. Within one or two years, we want to be the leaders in people's hearts and perceptions. Also, we are not in all cities right now, so we will be increasing our coverage. We changed our pack designs after getting consumer feedback about our visibility. That shows consumers that we are listening to them. They always loved Yörsan, but we need to remind them of our presence, mastership, and 50 year-experience in dairy with our campaigns, availability, and brand visibility. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the last decade, there have been several low cost airlines coming into the Turkish market. What's your take on the segment?</h4><p>As Pegasus Airlines, we were the first airline to launch a low-cost model service in Turkey in 2005, following the purchase of the airline by Esas Holding. Since then, we have revolutionized Turkey's aviation sector by offering affordable prices while keeping the quality of service high by investing in a new fleet and state-of-the-art technology and excellent connections. In late 2005, we launched our domestic flights because the market was saturated with chartered airlines. When we first entered the domestic scheduled market, we were ranked as the fifth carrier; now, we are by far second in the market. Our domestic market share is running about 28%, and Turkish Airlines is about 53%. The remaining 19% is shared between Bora Jet, Onur Airlines, Atlas Jet, and Sun Express. European low-cost carriers currently do not hold a sizeable share in Turkish market.</p><h4>What steps did you take in 2005 that moved you from fifth position to second?</h4><p>The first major step we had to take was selecting an airport to become our main hub out of which we base our operations, which was Istanbul Sabiha Gokçen International Airport. At that time, back in 2005, we were only operating chartered flights and had yet to move in to domestic scheduled operations. We were the first to really make our hub at Istanbul Sabiha Gokçen International Airport and, by being the pioneers, we transformed it into a primary airport, creating a completely new catchment zone around this airport on the Asian side of Istanbul that had not been served previously. Straddling two continents, the city certainly needed a main airport on its Asian shores and we recognized the potential there. It has also allowed us to maintain our successful on-time performance and to achieve the goals of our innovative low cost business model, which was the first in Turkish market. </p><h4>Are there any other ventures that Pegasus is doing apart from strictly flying people from A to B?</h4><p>When we launched our search for our new hub, it also cemented another line of thinking that became a core part of our business success; that of ancillary services. Delving into the parking garage business is a good example of our other ventures. When we began looking at airports, we noticed Sabiha Gokçen didn't have a parking lot. While we were discussing our needs with the head of the airport, the subject of car parking came up because there was not enough parking at the airport, and we decided then it would be in our best interest. We also develop other creative ways for guests to personalize their flying experience, often by forming new business partnerships in order to widen choice for them, such as car hire, hotel booking, visa services, optioned sales, and private transfers/shuttles. We are also proud of our user-friendly loyalty program, Pegasus Plus, which means our guests are awarded FlightPoints with every penny spent on tickets and other services including online check-in, excess luggage, pre-ordered inflight meals, and even the carriage of sports equipment. These FlightPoints can in turn then be spent on further such purchases.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead for Pegasus? </h4><p>With the delivery of our brand new aircraft, our Pegasus fleet is expanding and we are witnessing an increase in the number of our guests we carry. Indeed, Pegasus carried 10.17 million guests during the first half of 2015, translating to a year-on-year increase of 10%. We aim to continue to increase our capacity and expand further internationally, as fast as we can obtain bilateral rights from the Civil Aviation Authority. Our longer-term ambitions overall are continuing our steady double-digit growth and further improving our position as a leading regional low-cost carrier. When we look at the outlook for Turkish aviation for the coming years, we believe that Istanbul airspace and capacity will no longer be bottlenecked. Currently, there are two projects being developed. There is a third airport under construction, though upon completion the first one will be demolished. We are also currently building a second runway at Istanbul Sabiha Gokçen. Until these two projects become operational, there will be a bottleneck. Istanbul is at the heart of Turkish aviation, and the next few years present several challenges in terms of capacity restrictions. Once these two projects are completed and operational, the future of aviation in Turkey will be much brighter. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Huawei deploys services and products in 140 different countries around the world. How important is the Turkish market?</h4><p>Turkey is among the top 15 markets in the world for Huawei. Turkey also has an advantage with its large and young population, with an average age of 30 for a population of almost 80 million. In 2013, we started to expand operating Huawei consumer business, and today Turkey is one of the top 10 most important countries in this segment. </p><h4>Can you tell us more about the enterprise business?</h4><p>Since 2010, we have been cooperating with banks and with universities in Turkey, setting up high-performance computing centers for universities that use it mainly for research. Meanwhile, institutions can rent their capability to other companies or units that want to make use of that capacity. Because technology is linked, we also have all the capability and infrastructure that allows us to work in the railway business, including projects like the high-speed rail in Turkey. The government is building more lines for the high-speed rail network in Turkey and we provide the IT solutions for this, including the railway signaling GSMR systems. There are only three or four companies in the world that can provide this technology. </p><h4>How significant is the consumer segment within that broad range of solutions and technologies you offer?</h4><p>The consumer segment is interesting for us in terms of the variety of solutions we can offer. Now, everyone uses smartphones. Huawei has a complete working system that can cover many platforms on a smartphone, so all the applications you need are there. There are all sorts of services to be offered there to meet all sorts of solutions and make all the right connections. In Turkey, the consumer market is huge, with about 10 million smartphone sales a year. What Turkey can invest in is software and applications. In terms of network, Turkey has 3G, but further new technology is needed. The new advanced technology will offer the advantage of things happening in almost real time. That means there will be more opportunities in broadcasting, because you can receive a video as quickly as someone receives an SMS now. Huawei designs its own chipsets through its sub-company HiSilicon. Every year we invest 10% of our revenue in R&amp;D, which gives us a lot of advantage in terms of the technology we can develop and provide.</p><h4>How would you assess market awareness and market demand for Huawei devices here in Turkey?</h4><p>In Turkey, our P6, P7, G7 and Mate7 models were well received. Prior to this device, we did B2B business; now, we're expanding to B2C. We have started to learn from our own users and from competitors to know how best to promote our brand in Turkey. We hired market experts just for this, i.e. people who have rich experience in the industry. In consumer parts, we now have a very clear strategy, because have two brands; Huawei and Honor. Huawei is positioned for the middle and upper layers, while Honor is for middle and lower layers, especially for young people. With these two brands, we'll continue investing in brand awareness—that's the first step. </p><h4>What is your outlook for Huawei in Turkey in 2015?</h4><p>Our aim is to be an ICT leader in Turkey, covering everything from business and enterprise to consumer business, etc. We applaud the 3G licensing law which has effectively supported Huawei's continuous investments in R&amp;D and subsequent technological advancements across this country. We're going to continue to build on this and create business innovation here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the highlights of the MPT-76 rifle?</h4><p>We created weapons that combine two major features of weapons design—some weapons aim to have flexible usage, while others are only based on accuracy; generally, Western standards focus on accuracy and Soviet standards focused on flexible and adaptable usages. We tried to create weapons that combine both aspects. It is more highly capable than what we expected in the beginning. It can be used in any geographical climate that our armed forces operate in and it has the accuracy that is required by our standards. It has passed almost 50 different standard tests and it is still tested to make sure our weapon won't make any mistakes. We aim to replace the outdated weapons we are using in five to seven years. We believe these weapons are very capable, powerful, reliable, and it's the rifle that every solider should be comfortable holding.</p><h4>How do you assess your ability to regularly supply new products?</h4><p>Our production includes ammunition, small and heavy weapons, powders, and pyrotechnics. We do not cover the side of the defense industry related to electronic software. In traditional weapons requirements, we produce more than 80% of our armed forces requirements. However, we do have a lack of production in some ammunitions and weapons families, because we didn't initially think it would work economically. Now we are aware that as our export markets expand, we get better position to work in these segments because it's not limited to just our armed forces requirements, but the whole world market. </p><h4>What is your strategy to grow your market share in international markets?</h4><p>To grow your market share in international markets is not the easiest job. Ten years ago, we were relatively unnoticed. There are obstacles and advantages for us and for international companies, so the solution is to work together. One of our advantages is that our labor expenses are comparatively less than European standards and our human resources are very eager to achieve something. We have very young engineers who are eager to test their ability and demonstrate their capability. In Turkey, the defense industry is not just economic, but a matter of national heritage—these two things coming together ensures the success of the defense industry.</p><h4>What are MKEK's expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2014, our exports went up to $60 million. In 2013, our number was around $40 million. The year before that, it was in the 50s. Because of political instability in the Arabic states, exports slowed. This year, we will start rising again, because we are trying to diversify our markets. The Gulf region was the focus of our company, and now we are trying to diversify in the Far East, North and South America, and some Central Africa states. Also we are trying to export our export philosophy and our services rather than just our products. This also creates new opportunities for us because of our accumulated knowledge and human resources. For the next five years, we are trying to develop our company from the beginning of its journey, which is just production, into a mature and powerful R&amp;D institution. We are cooperating with universities and R&amp;D partnerships and trying to combine our production capability with their R&amp;D philosophy and we are trying to make good projects. No company can have success all by itself; we need to have partnerships and share the ideas and culture. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SSM aims for $25 billion in aviation and defense exports by 2023. Which products, and which export markets, are most important for achieving this aim?</h4><p>Our main target is to ensure progress and the development of the defense industry. In this respect, our country's vision for 2023 is a motivation source for us. By 2023, our aim is $5 billion in exports in defense, $10 billion exports in aviation, $5 billion exports in security, and $5 billion exports in civil aviation services and maintenance sub-sectors. We consider that our indigenous development approach and related R&amp;D infrastructure will provide significant support in boosting exports to $25 billion by 2023. Thanks to a range of undertaken national, multinational, and joint defense industry projects, SSM has become a highly skilled community consisting of large scale main contractors, numerous sub-system manufacturers, SMEs, R&amp;D companies that are involved in high-tech, niche areas, research institutes, and universities. From the perspective of product portfolio, today the Turkish defense industry has proven itself in numerous areas from aerospace, naval shipbuilding, tracked and wheeled armored vehicles, to satellite systems, armaments and munitions, missiles, rocketry, as well as advanced defense electronics. Through the initiatives set out in our strategic plan, we expect Turkish industry, with its growing indigenous capabilities and increased role in international partnerships, to expand into new emerging markets in different parts of the world. </p><h4>The Altay MBT will at first utilize a foreign-built engine, to later be replaced by an indigenous product. How is work in this area progressing?</h4><p>We have signed a contract with TÜMOSAN A.Åž. for the development of a diesel engine for our national tank. This program includes the local design and development, prototype production, test, and qualification of a diesel engine for our national tank and the program will be completed in 54 months. Also, as part of SSM's technology acquisition roadmap, we signed, in December 2012, a contract with Tusaş Motor Sanayi [TEI] for the production of prototype engines for the Anka unmanned air vehicle. We are also planning to sign a contract with TEI for the development of a turboshaft engine for our indigenous light utility helicopter program before the end of 2015.</p><h4>What is the status of the Joint Strike Fighter Program?</h4><p>Turkey is making solid progress in the Joint Strike Fighter Program. In 2014 we placed our first procurement order for two jets after the Defense Industry Executive's (DIEC) decision and, in January 2015, DIEC made the decision to order another four additional jets in line with Turkey's procurement plan. Turkish industrial participation in the program is also essential both for the production and sustainment phases. In December, the US government selected Turkey as the first F135 heavy engine MRO&amp;U center for the European region. We are expecting more sustained work for Turkey to serve globally for the benefits of F-35 users and our Pilot and Maintainer Integrated Training Center will be operational by 2019. As a partner nation, Turkey is committed to the program and continues to add value to the affordability targets of the partnership.</p><h4>What role do you see SMEs playing in the future of the Turkish defense sector? </h4><p>The defense sector is heavily dependent on R&amp;D in the search for ways of countering current and expected threats. It is composed of a small number of large international players and a vast number of smaller suppliers. The supplier industry is largely made up of SMEs. Together with system manufacturers, the sub-systems and supplier industry can manage to maintain a robust development and supply chain to offer the world's top-range products. SME involvement is an important component of our activities. The key to maintaining the efficiency of SMEs lies in creating a sound environment for innovative and internationally successful companies to work in. For SMEs this includes, for example, sufficient financial back up to compensate for program risks or delays or being considered as partners in research and technology projects. As such, there must be consistent support for creating framework conditions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of cyber security across industries and what are the opportunities for the cyber defense industry in Turkey?</h4><p>Cyber security has to be considered from two perspectives: first, on our own information system's requirements, and secondly, from the requirements of the Turkish military. For its own requirements, the Information Systems Department has been regenerated from scratch and the staff in that department have received training on handling threats. Also, the Ministry has updated the internal regulations applied to the information systems and the Ministry staff. We also have initiated an exercise applied to numerous governmental agencies to see our current situation against cyber-attacks. </p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy for boosting exports from the defense industry?</h4><p>In the scope of the 2012-16 Strategy Document objectives of the SSM, we will focus on the endeavors to ensure the health of the defense sector. Moreover, the SSM will guide the SMEs and suppliers represented in the defense industry in order to develop their capabilities related to the program management and levels of technology. For example, for our indigenous fighter jet program, we are looking for a working partner from Europe, not because we are afraid to develop the project ourselves, but more because it will allow us in the future to export it more easily. Most of the other countries we are partnering with in our products are also looking for the expertise of the Turkish army for training. </p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy for attracting and developing human capital?</h4><p>The process of product development progresses in a very problematic way without experience and development.  You either have to make concessions to quality or the process gets much longer. Furthermore, foreigners are ready to come to Turkey, just as the brain drain continues from our country to Western countries. The required labor force should begin to be trained now. A determined structuring which thoroughly coordinates all of the steps in the process is required for realizing our objectives. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the Turkish ability to create an armored fighting vehicle (AFV)?</h4><p>Altay is the most sophisticated high technology armored vehicle among others on the market, which demonstrates that we are one of the 9 or 10 Main Battle Tank developers in the world. Another example of the armored vehicle development capability exists in BMC Company, which developed Kirpi Mine Resistant Ambush Protect (MRAP) vehicles. Those vehicles are combat proven in many mine and IED attacks so far. In summary, during the last decade, we have reached the capability to design, develop, and produce any kind of armored vehicle to meet the requirements of Turkish Army, Turkish Police and the armies in the world.</p><h4>What is your vision of defense affairs in Turkey?</h4><p>The Turkish Defense Industry policy has been restructured and experienced a strategic transformation in the past 10 years. We are now able to design and manufacture our own critical technology defense systems. More than 10 years ago, 80% of our defense industry was dependent on foreign technology, but today by mobilizing Turkey's engineering and production capabilities, it has been transformed into a national structured industry with more than thousand of companies, SMEs, and the participation of research organizations and universities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What procedures is Güneş Sigorta putting in place in terms of retaining human capital?</h4><p>Human capital is a highly important and distinctive asset for companies operating in the service industry such as ourselves. The most important resource is talent; the only added value comes from talented people, and so we should coach and encourage our team. We are fortunate because we are a local company with a good reputation and newcomers prefer working for us.  On the other hand we run every line of business, including corporate and retail, with important market shares. Anyone joining our company has the opportunity to experience every aspect of the insurance business and they come across with different cases, as well as on-the-job training. Güneş Sigorta could be considered a school, taking into account its decent human resources approach, and our talent management system differentiates us from our competitors in the market</p><h4>What is Güneş Sigorta doing to take advantage of the growing insurance sector? How do you enhance your market penetration?</h4><p>As Güneş Sigorta, we have undergone an intense transformation process throughout last few years. We finished all the operational processes required for our restructuring in 2014.  During this process we invested in human resources. We developed our core insurance software system that has allowed our tariff structure to become “tailor-made“ like our products. We also organized a new structure within our regional configuration. We established six regional finance directorates that would operate in the field of banking insurance. We centralized our claims units. Most importantly, although market conditions challenged us from time to time, we never gave up our “high-profit source, high-profit branch“ strategy. We received the benefits of this process clearly in 2014. We grew higher than the market with a profit.</p><h4>What can the country do to increase insurance penetration?</h4><p>Our industry grows every year with the success of the national economy. It even surpasses the growth of our economy. This is partially a result of low penetration and partially the young population. We have to grow not through price competition based on market share, but with products that have added value and that can meet the needs of consumers. The society's needs and trends change constantly. Therefore, we must read into the future and trends accurately. We must direct our efforts by correctly analyzing the needs that stem from changes in society and the economy, as well as technological developments and globalization.  We must become an industry that does not focus solely on selling insurance, but one that discovers and meets the insurance needs of individuals and institutions and delivers impeccable service. When we become an industry where the concept of “Insurance Consultant“ can be truly realized, we shall easily meet the growth momentum we desire.</p><h4>Are there any specific programs that you have for Güneş Sigorta for 2015?</h4><p>Although 2015 is going to be another challenging year for our market, we will keep focusing on profitable lines and sources. As a subsidiary of Vakifbank, bank insurance is very important and profitable source of us.  We are running a special bank insurance project with Vakıfbank to maximize bank insurance income and make mutually profitable.  On the other hand Güneş Sigorta's priority is operational productivity boost for 2015. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your position in the market currently?</h4><p>Our company is a middle-to-large scale investment institution ranking fifth in assets under custody excluding foreign investors and that has complete range of investment products and services except derivatives. In terms of competition we focus on service quality instead of price competition. We treat our customers with fairness and transparency, something the competition does not always reflect onto their customers. We do not want to compete over commissions. If our customers want to do a flat business transaction on the Borsa Istanbul, IPOs, or sukuk (Participation bonds), we are transparent about it. We do business with these kinds of customers. If you want to do business in the right way, BMD is the place you should be as a customer.</p><h4>How many customers do you have?</h4><p>We have over 90,000 customers now. As a customer base, we are almost in the top 10; and we are in fifth place in terms of custody without including our foreign clients. Because of our services for Participation Banks forming economies of scale and without creating costs to them, our client base is rapidly developing. </p><h4>What strategy has allowed you to achieve your rate of growth?</h4><p>The rules of play are changing. On the brokerage side, we do not have any competition, nor do we want it. However, on the portfolio management side we need to grow faster and implement new tools, such as the participation index and products based on we cooperated with all the participation banks. We maintained a strategy of being in the middle, equidistant from all of them. We were the banks' trusted partners and we provided all the capital market products and services to their clients. This was the main reason for our growth. However, now the environment is changing. There are some new growth areas, such as pension funds. The government sukuk issues are also important for the same reason. Both conventional and Participation pension funds are there. We need to grow more on the asset management side, and this is one of our main issues. We are also working on a revenue sharing business model for asset management in that no additional costs incurred by the Participation Banks like we exactly do in the brokerage services. We think that only a structure in that the Participation Banks get service for their clients and obtain revenue without capital investment can be a sustainable one. </p><h4>How important is foreign investment for developing the participation sector in Turkey?</h4><p>The participation sector is dealing very closely with the real sector. Normally the conventional banking system deals with money, but the participation sector is dealing with the real sector. So, the Gulf countries and other countries can easily make direct investments in Turkey with the participation sector and their financial vehicles. </p><h4>You are currently working on creating a participation index. How significant is the new index for BMD?</h4><p>The index has a methodology in line with international standards. We will also launch a sukuk index in the near future, which will give investors basic tools for asset allocation so they can easily pick up whatever they want. This system is a bit low-cost and more understandable for investors. We have had two years with a participation index. It included 30 stocks trading on the Borsa Istanbul, but we have added two new indices, one with 50 shares and the other which is quant index called model portfolio index. Hence, now we have three indices in the participation index family, and we are trying to create more.</p><h4>What is the development timeline for the ETF and the new indices?</h4><p>The next indices will be easier compared to the first one. The first one lasted two years or so. All the participation banks had to be brought together to approve the rules, and that took some time. We created the new indices based on the same rulebook as the participation index, therefore these should take less than a year or thereabouts. Actually, the calculation is made by the Istanbul stock exchange. We chose the stocks every three months for the model portfolio every two weeks and send the new stock list to the exchange, and they calculate and broadcast the index for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The pensions and life insurance industry in Turkey is developing quickly. How does Vakıf Emeklilik fit into this picture?</h4><p>The private pension system (PPS) started to make a huge contribution to the Turkish economy especially after 2013. In 2013, the government introduced a new aspect to the pension system. Since then, the government has started to pay a state subsidy of 25% for each participant. After the government introduced the 25% contribution to each pension plan at the beginning of 2013, pension fund assets grew 85% in only two years, according to the Pension Monitoring Centre. We expect this growth will continue in 2015. While the number of people in the system until 2013 was only 3 million, today it is 5.5 million and, while the total fund size volume was $7.35 billion during the first nine years, now it has reached $14.7 billion within two years. This is a success, but the government should not be complacent, because we still have a relatively low level of savings and the pension system has room to improve. Besides, when we consider our savings instruments, our diversity is not very encouraging. When we look at population who should be saving, the penetration is only 12%. We should provide more facilities and products for potential savers. Our company was established in 1991 with the aim of operating in the life insurance business. In 2003, with changing regulations, we added pension operations. Briefly related to the year 2015, Vakıf Emeklilik increased its share in the industry to 7%. In addition to our profitability target, our supreme target is to increase our market share involvement above 8% in 2015.</p><h4>What differentiates Vakıf Emeklilik from its competitors?</h4><p>As Vakıf Emeklilik, we will continue to progress with all our determination to be the most admired, leading company in terms of customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction by 2016, our 25th anniversary. Vakıf Emeklilik's private pensions plans are bundled with additional benefits. The customers only pay for their pension plan and benefit from various assistance services. This is a huge benefit compared to our competitors. In addition, we are changing the IT infrastructure and applying a one-to-one approach with our CRM systems. We are a company that has introduced some innovative products into niche markets. For example, we are the first insurance company to introduce Participation life insurance in Turkey and this was a partnership with Türkiye Finans. Another point is that we are the first life insurance company offering a mobile branch so that our clients can access every service—from fund management to contribution payment—available from the desktop branch through their mobile devices. Our present and potential customers tend to buy their needs online and, as a life insurance company, it is important for us to supply such services at the mobile age.</p><h4>How do you work to increase market penetration?</h4><p>Potential customers do not know much about our industry or our products and it takes time to develop a reliable reputation. Our aim is to reach young people because the size of this group means there is high potential for growth. According to me, we should encourage the population to enter the system at an earlier stage and start to save at their mid-20s. The statistics show that earlier entry is necessary for sustainable life standards.</p><h4>How do you see domestic life insurance companies in Turkey dealing with potential international investors?<br></h4><p>There are around 19 companies in Turkey and this size does not justify the numbers. When we look at shareholders' expectations and break-even points, we can expect some consolidation. Of course, international interest will always be high. If you look at our shareholder structure, it is quite international and this interest seems to continue. With increasing penetration, especially in life insurance, the business will develop, so these companies can make money. Now, per capita insurance expenditure is $150, which is less than one-tenth of developed countries. As far as I am concerned, we still have room to grow here. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have bold targets for the coming year. We will exceed an 8% market share and will continue increasing our market share, as well as our productivity and innovative approach in the market. As the leading company in the industry, we have set assertive targets for next year. Next year our aim is to reach more participants. In 2016, we will continue to apply our distribution channel strategies with our innovative products. We are planning to lower the entrance age to the PPS with our marketing efforts particularly directed toward young people, encouraging them to increase their savings by staying in the system for longer. Our efforts in the corporate PPS will continue to increase in 2016, as in this year. We always succeeded in being the innovative leader of the industry with our vision and services. We are working hard for perfection of the details considered as a standard in the industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have declining oil prices affected Turkey's strategies for securing fuel sources to satisfy its growing energy needs?</h4><p>Turkey is in the middle of a strong industrialization process. Its population is rising. Consequently, energy demand is growing. In fact, the fastest pace realized among OECD member countries is by Turkey. Despite the last crisis, total primary energy supply has increased with a pace of almost 4% per annum on average over the last decade. However, Turkey is a net energy importer due to its scarce hydrocarbon resources. Turkey imports around 74% of its energy needs, and almost all of its oil and gas demand. That brings about a rising energy import bill, which accounts for around 60% of the foreign trade deficit in general. Thus, Turkey employs an energy policy aiming at reducing import dependence for the diversification of energy supply sources, notably nuclear and renewable energy, and the oil and gas sources with the construction of new supply pipelines, such as the TANAP project and the new Ceyhan terminal. In fact this policy is a long-running policy, not very related to oil price levels. But I must admit that we are happy with the declining oil prices.</p><h4>How does regional instability affect Turkey's energy security?</h4><p>Turkey is sitting at a very strategic location. We are neighboring the Middle East and the Caucasus. Both of these regions embody many problems and potential conflicts that may easily turn into instabilities. Being an island of stability for many decades, Turkey is well experienced in being surrounded by conflict. Turkey imports crude from many countries, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and Libya. When we look at the major crude source countries we see that Iran, Russia, and Saudi Arabia always account for a majority share. For example, in 2005, Russia accounted for 31%, Iran 29%, and Saudi Arabia 15%. In 2010, the first year of unrest in Arab countries, the shares of these countries in crude imports came in at 20%, 43%, and 12%, respectively. Last year, imports from Russia declined very sharply, but the shares of Iran and Saudi Arabia came in at 30% and 11%, respectively. Iraq was the largest crude oil source country in 2014, as in 2013.</p><h4>What are the prospects for nuclear energy in the country?</h4><p>Nuclear electricity generation is a strong option for Turkey in our efforts in controlling energy import dependency. Nuclear is also important in reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, Turkey has developed a policy agenda aiming to introduce nuclear power generation. In fact, given the scarcity of its indigenous resources, Turkey has considered nuclear as a priority in its energy agenda for many decades, and accordingly attempted several times to build a nuclear power plant. However, all attempts failed. Consequently, intergovernmental agreements were adopted as a method to get the ball moving. The road map for nuclear energy deployment aims at having a nuclear installed capacity accounting for 5% of total generation by 2023, which will eventually reach 12% by 2030. Two intergovernmental agreements signed with Russia and Japan are the main pillars in the realization of these targets.</p><h4>What steps can be taken to make conditions in the renewable sector more attractive to investors?</h4><p>Turkey attributes importance and gives priority to renewable sources. Therefore, a specific law, namely the Law on Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources for the Purpose of Generating Electrical Energy, was adopted in 2005. Later in 2010, the law was amended comprehensively. The amendment, coupled with the licensing of wind applications, accelerated the deployment of renewables. Consequently, the wind capacity has reached 3.7 GW, while it was only 20 MW in 2005. Similarly, geothermal capacity increased almost 30 fold and reached to 400 MW. Hydro capacity almost doubled over the same period and reached close to 24 GW. Solar will be added to the system in a big way in the near future with the completion of licensing process. The feed-in tariffs provided to renewables are indeed attractive enough for the financing of investments. Moreover, current currency exchange rates provide extra incentives to plants in operation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key aims and objectives of the Capital Markets Board of Turkey?</h4><p>Until 2014, membership was limited to brokerage houses and commercial banks, but last year, after new regulations, we now represent a bigger part of the finance industry, including banks and brokerage houses, portfolio management companies, real estate companies, private equity, and venture capital investment companies. This means that we cover nearly every activity related to capital markets and banking activities. Of course this new structure brings more responsibilities for us, and we have some targets as an association. We would like to increase savings in Turkey, where the savings ratios are very low compared to other countries and represent one of the fundamental problems of our economy. Secondly, we would like to increase the length of investments. For example, in Turkey, for small investments, culturally people like to invest in short-term conservative products and this means short-term deposits and short-term government bonds. We would like to change that structure; we would like to convince investors to invest in longer-term products. These are our main aims and in the short term we believe that there should be specific government incentives to get some early and fast results. The second focus is a longer-term policy to increase the financial literacy of the people in general. These are the two components of our policy; more savings and longer-term savings. The second target for us, the famous Istanbul Financial Center initiative, is the first in Turkey, and we believe that Istanbul is a natural center for regional finance. The third is to bring in new products and services. The fourth area is that there are some markets here in Turkey that we would like to see more developed and more liquid; for example, if you look at the stock market or the futures market here, they are very liquid, they would like to grow, and they would like to support that options business, but what we believe is that we should have bigger and more liquid options market here in Turkey. Education and training are also very important for our members. On the education side we target two different people, the first being the market professionals, which are directly related to the employees of our members, and the second is more general, just targeting financial literacy. It is not a direct program; we use social media and the internet, and so forth, to increase the financial awareness of Turks.</p><h4>How do you use education to build greater awareness of the capital markets?</h4><p>We have formal training programs targeting market professionals. First of all, we provide training for around 4,500 to 5,000 people. That is face-to-face classroom education, and in addition we organize seminars and conferences to develop the awareness level of the industry. On top of that we have periodic research reports that we distribute to market professionals and in those reports we publish articles related to developments in the global markets, and we talk about the developments in Turkey that target local investors. If you look on the website you can see publications in English, which are directed to foreign investors, but for the domestic market. We try to explain what is going on in the global market, for example EU directives, what is happening structurally in the US, trading platforms, crowd funding, and topics like that. We would like to inform the financial community about global trends.</p><h4>What are the association's plans for the year ahead?</h4><p>For savings, there are two components; increasing savings—we will try to convince the government to offer incentive plans to encourage longer-term savings, like the pension plan—and secondly, to invest in people, to increase financial literacy, and offer education and training programs for people to increase awareness. For example, we held a short film festival and competition focusing on savings, in which university students took part. We will run it again this year as well, and we also have children's theater to teach them about the importance of saving. These programs are designed to raise awareness in the general community about finance. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ATC evolved in the past year?</h4><p>We were originally founded to foster the relationship between the US and Turkish defense sectors, but as the Turkish defense sector has become so much more mature in recent years and is becoming very capable on its own, we see that the ATC needs to expand itself. We need to branch out into a lot more of the emerging sectors. Accordingly, there have been changes to our flagship event, the Annual Conference on US-Turkish Relations. This year we intentionally changed the date of the event to September. Usually it's been in the summer time, as Congress winds down its year before leaving Washington, but this year we moved it to stay out of the elections here in Turkey. We also expanded the event to encompass broader economic and political communities that are part of the US-Turkish relationship. We are making a very strong effort this year to generate broad interest in the bilateral relationship, by going into some other industries we haven't been much into the past, like education or the energy sector. We are really looking at the renewable sector this year whilst agriculture is also important. We are excited this year to promote a more diverse group and conference, with which we are hoping to attract a wider audience.</p><h4>Should there be more outreach from the Turkish business community to Congress?</h4><p>It has to be done smartly, though. I think the way to do that is not through direct Turkish business outreach to Congress, but through business-to-business relationships and building business constituencies. That's done in many ways, such as joint ventures, and by establishing closer economic relations on a daily basis. That will translate to a higher level of trust and collaboration, which will find its way into Congress. Since I took over, I've been trying to promote inclusiveness. Most organizations that are in this sphere have a voice. At the ATC, we are really excited to work with these other organizations when our interests align. Relevant, timely events are really what we're going after, but they don't have to be large. Some of our members prefer smaller, more focused events for specific topics or sectors.</p><h4>What role can US businesses play in supporting Turkish companies' ambitions to develop their own defense products?</h4><p>We are in a transition phase now. Our Turkish members often tell me that they want to be partners, not customers. That is a very accurate way of putting it. Turkish defense companies want to do things with companies like Roketsan and Lockheed-Martin, who last year agreed on a missile deal for the F-35. Inherent in these types of joint ventures is technology and skills transfer. The impending Tor missile system is another example. The primary concern from the Turkish defense sector is that of learning new technologies and skills. Turkey has the manufacturing capacity, but it still lacks a certain amount of technology and engineering capacity. There are some incredibly well educated folks here in Turkey, of course, but it's the nuts and bolts of applying the knowledge they have and adopting their own indigenous products. Through joint ventures and other partnerships, I believe US companies can help Turkey on its road towards indigenous technology. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Recently, job creation in the construction and agricultural sectors has slowed in Turkey. Which sectors are you prioritizing for development until 2019?</h4><p>In the period 2007-13, approximately 4.6 million new jobs were created and informal employment rate decreased significantly in non-agricultural sectors. Turkish economy has been the fastest growing country in Europe in 2010 and 2011 with 9.2% and 8.8% growth rates respectively, mostly thanks to proactive policy measures. In 2012 and 2013, in parallel with the decrease in the economic growth rate, agricultural employment declined, but its share in total employment stayed at the same level. In 2013, the number of people employed in the manufacturing and services sectors increased around 4% and their share in total employment reached to 20.7% and 50.9% respectively. In the construction sector, in the last decade, the highest employment growth rate of 17% was realized in 2011, which has decelerated in the subsequent period in line with the developments in the GDP growth rate. On the other hand, the construction sector's share in total employment, which was around 7% in the last two years, has been preserved. Today, skilled labor force raises its vital role at the global level. Supporting the development of alternative types of tourism, such as health tourism, conference tourism, winter tourism, and cultural tourism are considered as priority areas. Our target is to place Turkey among the leading countries in foreign contracting services in terms of profitability and services quality. In addition, in context of reducing the trade deficit, improving high-tech manufacturing in such a way that will support the exports in priority sectors such as the metal industry, electrical and electronics, machinery and equipment, the chemical industry, and the automotive sector is vital. In this sense, accessing new markets in the services and industrial sectors, increasing total value-added in exports, and taking our place among welfare countries are among the priorities of our development policy.</p><h4>How would you describe the current state of economic relations between Turkey and the US, and what policies can be enacted to enable further bilateral investment?</h4><p>Turkey and the US have been close allies for many years. The political relationship has always been at its best. However, the economic and commercial relationship could not meet the level of political relations. During the visit of President Obama to Turkey in April 2009, it was decided to increase the level of cooperation in the economic and commercial relationship to the level of “model partnership“. In this vein, the Turkey-US Framework of Strategic Economic and Commercial Cooperation (FSECC) was established and 2 coordinator Ministers on each side was appointed. Right now, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan and Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci on the Turkish side, US Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and US Trade Representative Michael Froman on the US side are serving as coordinators. As Turkey, we attach great importance to the FSECC mechanism. The 3rd Ministerial Meeting was held in May this year and both sides had the opportunity to discuss ways to improve economic and commercial relations of Turkey and the US at the highest level. Under the FSECC mechanism, Turkey-US Business Council was established as a platform to ensure more business friendly environment for the Turkish and US investors. The Ministry of Economy of Turkey and the US Department of Commerce are co-chairing this platform together with Turkish and US private sector chairs. The third meeting of the Business Council was held in Istanbul in June this year. </p><h4>What are some of the Ministry's primary development goals for the year ahead? </h4><p>Our Ministry's primary goals include supporting high-tech production, increasing export price per kilogram, decreasing our current account deficit and attracting more foreign direct investment. In order to reach our 2023 goals, we have to increase our R&amp;D and innovation capacity as well as producing and exporting high value added products. We have put forward our current investment incentive system to manage technological transformation and increase our export capacity. Additionally our Ministry gives incentives to our exporters in many fields including R&amp;D, branding, and design. Besides, in our Medium-Term Program covering the 2015-2017 period, the growth rate of 2015 is expected to be 4.0%. Our exports and imports are expected to be $173 billion and $258 billion respectively. We expect to have an unemployment rate of 9.5% and inflation rate of 6.3%. In the current program, we expect our current account deficit to GDP ratio to be 5.4%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Turkey is a country that has a considerable political role and potential, a country that has demonstrated impressive economic development. Our political relationship is now established, a strategic cooperation framework has been signed, and our two foreign ministers will regularly meet with each other. As we have important cooperation occurring, this agreement will also be completed in terms of defense. We are two members of NATO, two allies. But I can say that Turkey is a big country economically, with impressive growth over these last years. We note Turkey's rise in purchasing power, particularly low public debt, and its remarkable industrial capacity. France is playing its part, when I look at the numbers our presence is important, with many French companies present here, but we are not at the level desired by Turkey and France. And what area should correspond to the dynamism of our economies? We should work together in energy, and specifically civil nuclear energy. Strategic contracts have been established, including with Japan and France, as this area of industrial agreement has to be developed. However, there is not only nuclear energy, there is also renewable energy. Here, many companies have been engaged in this process. There is the transport sector, both for high-speed lines and for aeronautics, and even for ground transportation. In terms of food, we have high capacity and great opportunities. But it is not simply related to economic contracts, trade is required; it is essential since Turkey is an emerging country. It is a country that has now reached a level of development that makes it the 17th largest economy in the world, with the goal of becoming one of the top 10 countries economically. Finally, France and Turkey know the value of their language, culture, science, and progress. </p><p>We are indeed proud to have welcomed Turkish authors and artists of high reputation to France. We also have a great admiration for the contemporary art that comes from your country, including cinema and theater. You have reminded us of the great French writers who have emerged during different centuries, Turkey. That is what we still encourage, academic and scientific exchange. From this original alliance has been born multiple exchanges between our two countries, which have never been denied across languages, cultures, and societies. Everything bears witness to the strength of the relationship between Turkey and France. I want to commend the contribution of many Turks who, over the years, came to live in France, started families, and sometimes took French nationality. Today, there are over 600,000 participating in the vitality of our Republic. <br>I also want to mention the accession negotiations of Turkey to the EU. I know that the European perspective is here in Turkey. Accession negotiations have been occurring for many years, since 2004, and France believes that this process should continue in good faith, in accordance with the agreed conditions and procedures. We will see the truth will come out of these negotiations if they are conducted in this spirit. Europe and Turkey have already signed, and I thank the Turkish authorities for this, an agreement on immigration issues, which are always sensitive. Turkey has involved itself in what is called a readmission agreement that allows for the control of illegal immigration to EU countries, since we know that some illegal immigration passes through Turkey, without complying with Turkish immigration. So it was necessary to have this monitoring process and again Turkey took an important role. </p><p>Finally, we have the question of the Customs Union, a subject that is important for Turkey. The Customs Union between Turkey and Europe dates from 1996 and has a role in trade development. And we must do everything to ensure that the Customs Union is as clear as possible. Turkey and France will host two major events next year; the G20 Summit here in Turkey and the Conference on Climate Change in Paris. Our two countries decided to act together in a coordinated way to exercise our responsibilities successfully for these two appointments. It is our intention to not avoid anything, to conceal nothing in what can sometimes be sensitive issues, including historical memories. But at the same time we want to engage in a long-term process of trust, which politically needs to be heard, especially on the most sensitive issues; and to have more mutual economical results because it is in our interests to look into this merger, which as I said is historic but mostly tied to the future of our continent, and region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did BCCT's partnership with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) come about?</h4><p>There was an initiative launched in 2012 by the Ministry of Trade and Investment under then-minister Lord Green. The issue was that the UK government wanted to look at how they could help create a global ecosystem of support for British exporters. Lord Green came up with this initiative, whereby they would look at the 20 fastest growing emerging markets, which at the time included Turkey. They wanted to see how they could bring the knowledge and experience of UKTI together with the other British business NGOs, including the British chambers of commerce and other British business groups. UKTI had a budget from the British Government to provide financial support so that British NGOs could enhance their capabilities so they could work hand-in-glove with the UKTI team. Over time UKTI would transfer services it was providing over to the chambers and other organizations. This was launched in March 2013. At that time all the 20 markets were invited to London and the respective overseas business networks (OBNs) delivered their business plans and discussed what services they could offer that would be comparable and complementary to what UKTI was already doing. The UKTI team in London assessed our plan and whether it would add value for them. Once approved by the UKTI, the government would then provide funding, which would initially last for two years.</p><h4>What are your current aims?</h4><p>Our main priority is still our members, of which we have over 400 paying members, the key to maintaining sustainable membership is providing a value exchange that is relevant and consistent. Plus we have our major sponsors; we wanted to make sure that the big British investors in Turkey would be represented on our board, companies like Unilever, BP, Vodafone, Shell, HSBC, and so on. Those big players gave us that credibility so that UK companies could see that we have serious experience and knowledge availability from those large multinationals in our organization. The UK has been the largest investor in Turkey over the last 10 years, so we have a very strong relationship with Turkey and our bi-lateral trade continues to grow YoY, currently at around $12-13 billion with about 65% of that being Turkey-to-UK exports. </p><h4>Which sectors do you think represent the highest potential for UK-Turkish cooperation?</h4><p>The sectors we prioritize in the UK are energy, infrastructure, design, health, education, innovation, aerospace, and increasingly agriculture, where we have a lot of technology in the agro-innovation sector. In education, there's a shortage of English-language teaching in state schools and there's a demand for more UK educational institutions providing examination and the UK education system in higher education. Turkey's HR ability is growing, and it has a very well educated workforce. Turkey is today an exporter of executives, considering the number of Turkish executives that run companies around the world. Arcilik/Beko just signed an agreement with Cambridge University to set up an R&amp;D facility that would develop a next generation of white goods and home electronics. In terms of defense and aerospace industry, Turkey is still a critical country geo-strategically, and it has to have good defense capabilities and it has to be stable and strong, and it has to be an economic driver for the region and the link to other emerging markets around the area and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has ISPAT's role in investment support developed over time?</h4><p>The establishment of ISPAT in 2006 is an integral part of a comprehensive reform agenda whose main pillars are the FDI law enacted in 2003 and major amendments made to the commercial code in 2012. These two important laws helped establish a business-friendly environment by not only conferring some essential rights to international investors but by also presenting international standards, transparency, and accountability to business context. In this sense, ISPAT was established as the official organization for promoting Turkey's investment environment and opportunities to the global business community and providing assistance to international investors at every stage of their investment in Turkey. As a consequence of such a transparent and predictable environment, together with the corporate capability and international network of ISPAT, FDI into Turkey skyrocketed. Total FDI into Turkey stood at only $15 billion until 2002, while the country was able to attract $150 billion in the last 13 years.</p><h4>One of Turkey's primary goals is diversifying its sources of FDI. How successfully has this strategy been implemented thus far?</h4><p>The recent global financial crisis showed that every single economy in the world was mutually attached to one other and it damaged the ones that put a lot of eggs in a limited number of baskets in terms of export markets or FDI sources. Although Turkey had already diversified its export markets and sources of FDI at a certain level before the global crisis, the country strategically determined to have a better distribution of its eggs in different baskets to ensure balanced and sustainable proceeds of exports and inflow of FDI. For this reason, ISPAT employed its international network to attract more FDI from capital-rich and emerging countries such as Japan, China, South Korea, the Gulf countries, Russia, and the US, on top of Turkey's traditional FDI sources. Eventually, Turkey managed to attain a more balanced inward FDI profile. The share of Near and Middle Eastern countries, as well as of Asian countries and Russia, increased considerably over the period of 2010-2014 when compared to 2002-2010 period. For instance, while Near and Middle East Asia's share in Turkey's total FDI inflow was 10% in the 2002-2010 period, this increased to 15% over the last five years. Similarly, Russia doubled its share and reached the 5% level. Hence, we can confidently express that Turkey has successfully implemented the diversification strategy so far.</p><h4>The Southern Gas Corridor is positioning Turkey as an energy hub and a highly strategic conduit for European energy security. How is the development of energy infrastructure impacting Turkey's overall investment landscape?</h4><p>The Southern Gas Corridor is an important project for the EU that secures the energy supply of Europe by diversifying sources. The Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP), meanwhile, is the most substantial component of the Southern Gas Corridor and originates from Azerbaijan and passes through Georgia and Turkey, reaching Greece. Turkey will not only become an energy corridor between Azerbaijan and Europe, but also will also participate in overseas contracting and meet a considerable amount of its energy needs from the project. There is no doubt that it is not possible for a country to attract major scale investment projects unless it has a continuous and secure energy supply. Hence, TANAP will be an enabler for new international investments in Turkey and will impact the overall investment landscape positively. On top of that, it will have an immediate value-added to the economy; the size of the project is more than $1.5 billion and it employs more than 15,000 people.</p><h4>Istanbul is becoming increasingly popular as a regional headquarters for multinational corporations (MNCs). What differentiates Istanbul from other cities vying to host regional headquarters?</h4><p>Turkey, and Istanbul in particular, have some natural assets such as geographical and cultural proximity to neighboring countries and regions that make it an attractive destination for multinational corporations (MNCs) as their regional headquarters. A total of 1.5 billion people live within a four-hour flight time of Turkey, where the volume of economic activity exceeds $26 trillion and international trade reaches $8 trillion. On top of these natural assets, Turkey's political and economic stability in the last 13 years has facilitated the increasing existence of headquarters of MNCs in Istanbul. In addition, there is also another opportunity for MNCs that have not yet established their regional headquarters in Istanbul to benefit from the increasing network effect of the business environment in Istanbul, where more than fifty MNCs, including Coca-Cola, GE Healthcare, Microsoft, and Intel have management bases. </p><h4>How have structural changes over the past decade enabled Turkey's strengthening economic power and affected the business environment?</h4><p>Over the past 13 years, the Turkish economy has more than tripled in size, reaching $800 billion as of 2014. Similarly, Turkey's exports more than quadrupled, exceeding $158 billion by the end of 2014. The remarkable performance with the steady growth over the last 13 years was the result of a sound macroeconomic strategy in combination with prudent fiscal policies and major structural reforms in the banking sector and in FDI laws. These reforms integrated the Turkish economy into the globalized world and created an investor-friendly business environment, while transforming the country into one of the major recipients of FDI in its region.</p><h4>What are the key targets of ISPAT for the forthcoming year? </h4><p>In the current global conjuncture where European economies lose their power as FDI sources, Asian economies are emerging as new sources of FDI. China and India, in addition to Japan, are becoming increasingly important in terms of their potential to invest abroad. For example, China's outward investment amount has been steadily increasing for the last 10 years and it is expected to exceed $100 billion annually in the coming years. For this reason, we will continue with our strategy of focusing on and targeting these economies in 2014. Besides, the other key target for ISPAT is to attract technology and R&amp;D-intensive investments in the manufacturing industry, as well as investments in the energy sector. These investments will enable Turkey to transfer technology, promote Turkey to transform into a knowledge economy, and help mitigate external fragilities. We have been successful in practicing this strategy in recent past, and I hope we will keep serving our country by attracting more investments in 2015 and beyond.</p><h4>Antalya-based Sun Express broke through the $1 billion revenue barrier last year. How will it continue on this successful path and what impact will its improving stature have on Turkey's positioning as a regional transport hub?</h4><p>SunExpress, a joint venture between Turkish Airlines and Lufthansa, celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Often dubbed the “holiday airline," SunExpress is the most experienced airline after Turkish Airlines in Turkey and posted its largest revenue in 2014 at $1.25 billion. SunExpress is also the airline that carries the highest number of tourists in the Mediterranean and Aegean regions on scheduled flights. Contrary to other airlines picking Istanbul as their hub, SunExpress preferred to concentrate on Antalya and Izmir, flying to 35 international and eight domestic destinations from Antalya and 30 international and 13 domestic destinations from Izmir. I am also happy to join the SunExpress Board of Directors and support the joint venture company on its journey to an even more successful future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Given the slowdown in structural and policy reform in more advanced economies, what can be done to motivate a more active uptake of new policy?</h4><p>A return to the pre-crisis growth path remains elusive for a majority of countries, many of which are confronted by similar challenges: slowing productivity, high long-term unemployment, and falling labor force participation. Restoring healthy growth, while ensuring that the gains are broadly shared, requires determined and systematic actions across a broad range of policy areas. The OECD's annual flagship report “Going for Growth," released last February in Istanbul during the first G20 finance ministers meeting of the Turkish Presidency, has shown that, unfortunately, the pace of reforms has slowed in a majority of advanced economies in the past two years. We understand the difficulties many governments face in pushing for reforms in a context of chronic demand shortfalls and limited budgetary leeway. Yet we see a bigger risk in the slower pace and breadth of reforms: that of a vicious circle whereby weak demand undermines potential growth, which in turn further depresses demand, as both investors and consumers lose confidence.</p><h4>How do you assess the structural reforms and the PPP programs ongoing in Turkey to increase the role of the private sector in infrastructure and the economy?</h4><p>Turkey's commitment to a package of 25 “structural transformation programs" is a promising example of a broad approach to reforms. Planned measures to promote technological skills, to foster flexible security in labor markets and to raise women's participation in economic life will boost private sector confidence and investment, and lift potential growth. “Promoting Investment" is the second “I" of Turkey's G20 growth narrative, so successfully mobilizing PPPs is vital on the home front. Turkey's domestic savings continues to fall short of its vast investment needs. Moreover, the government is determined to maintain public borrowing at a low level, and not to permit a drift in the public debt/GDP ratio. This opens the door for PPP projects. The 10th Development Plan 2014-18 projects total public infrastructure investment of $250 billion over five years, with additional PPP investments of $100 billion. PPP projects will include the construction of a nuclear power plant, Istanbul's third airport, urban renewal projects, rebuilding earthquake-prone neighborhoods, harbors, hospitals, motorways, and high-speed railway tracks. To endow this huge PPP portfolio with a sound governance framework, a special committee on PPPs recommended the adoption of a new framework law to help ensure diverse contractual forms, fiscal transparency, and EU-compatible pro-competitive procurement procedures. These recommendations are most welcome.</p><h4>As Turkey targets exports of $227 billion by 2018, what has to be done to further integrate Turkey in the global economy?<br></h4><p>If exports continue following the 2010-14 growth trajectory, they would reach $225 billion by 2018. However, this assumes a relatively subdued global outlook. However, if the pace of the global recovery picks up and if Turkish exports rise as fast as during the 2000s, exports could actually reach $280 billion by 2018. Achieving stronger export performance is crucial for rebalancing domestic and external demand, and reducing the current account deficit. We emphasize three factors for Turkey's progress: first, achieving additional structural change in the business sector, with larger size and better capitalized exporters, to foster price and non-price competitiveness; second, achieving deeper participation in global value chains, notably with European manufacturers; and third, further diversifying trade towards higher growth export markets. Since 2005, nearly 20 new bilateral trade agreements have been finalized and exports to the countries concerned have increased very swiftly.</p><h4>What strategy does Turkey need to continue its globalization process while simultaneously maintaining economic stability?</h4><p>Turkish exporters have managed to rapidly grow their businesses across the region over the past decade, and investments have also increased rapidly. Expanding links with regional partners has greatly benefited Turkey, in particular the hitherto less developed eastern and southeastern regions. The volatile political and economic conditions of neighboring countries are however obvious potential sources of instability for the Turkish economy. We witnessed this in 2013, as imports from the MENA region tumbled, and in 2014 with Russia and Ukraine, when their imports from Turkey collapsed. Against this backdrop, Turkey could deepen its economic integration with the European Union—which accounts for 44% of Turkish exports—as demanded by the new EU strategy adopted in 2014. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<intervieweelist0description><![CDATA[Influenced by a trade unionist family member, Jacob Zuma became involved in politics at an early age, joining the African National Congress (ANC) in 1958. He became an active member of the ANC’s armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, in 1962, following the banning of the ANC in 1960. While on his way out of the country in 1963, he was arrested and sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment. He left South Africa in December 1975 and for the next 12 years was based in Southern Africa. Following the unbanning of the ANC in February 1990, he was one of the first ANC leaders to return to South Africa to begin the process of negotiations with the then apartheid regime. In 1991, at the first ANC conference held in South Africa since 1959, he was elected Deputy Secretary General. He was elected ANC Deputy President in December 1997, and served as Deputy President of South Africa from 1999 until June 2005. Zuma was elected ANC President in December 2007, becoming the ANC’s candidate for South African president in the 2009. ]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bilateral trade between Turkey and South Africa was over $2 billion in 2013, chiefly in the mining and textile sectors. How has trade grown between the two states since then, and which areas of trade have proven the most important?</h4><p>In 2013 trade volume between the two countries amounted to $868 million, with South African exports accounting for $434 million and imports from Turkey accounting for $498 million of total trade. According to preliminary trade data for 2014, exports recorded an increase of 6% (from $434 million in 2013 to $463 million in 2014), while imports recorded an increase of 11% (from $436 million to $506 million). During the period 2013-14, mineral exports recorded an increase of 59% (from $134.5 million to $217 million). South African imports of textiles recorded an increase of 55% (from $38 million in 2013 to $70.1 million in 2014). South Africa's major exports to Turkey in 2014 included mineral fuels and ores, slag and ash, and iron and steel. Leading imports from Turkey included vehicles other than railway-related products, including tramways, machinery, and nuclear reactors. South African exports to Turkey continue to be dominated by minerals and semi-processed minerals. In this regard, the Department of Trade and Industry has undertaken several trade promotion activities to promote exports of high-value added products.</p><h4>What are some of the most beneficial aspects of the trade relationship between South Africa and Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey has a wealth of knowledge in the clothing and textile industry as well as the mineral beneficiation and jewelry sectors. Turkish companies will benefit from the need for South Africa to process its wealth of minerals into value-added products, to be utilized domestically or to be exported. Turkish experience in the machinery, textile, and construction industries can help the South African economy develop even faster.</p><h4>How can South Africa facilitate access to the rest of Africa for Turkish investors?</h4><p>Economic relations between South Africa and Turkey are governed by the South Africa-Turkey Joint Economic Commission (JEC). The primary objective of the JEC is to promote and deepen bilateral trade and economic cooperation between the two countries. Trade and Investment South Africa just recently signed a MoU with ISPAT, the Turkish investment promotion agency. The objective of the agreement is to support investors from our respective countries with targeted projects. It is widely recognized that Africa is on a new growth trajectory. The continent has chosen an industrialization path driven through regional integration, infrastructure development, mineral beneficiation, and developing the agricultural value chain. Turkey already has a strong presence on the continent and by forging partnerships between companies from our two countries, and we can make an invaluable contribution to these objectives. South Africa is strategically positioned to serve as an entry point into the rest of the African continent for Turkish business. Cooperation and partnership between us will ensure that we contribute toward the promotion of the continent's interests, at both the regional and global levels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Vestel sells and exports Japanese and European brands to the European market. Are there plans to sell Vestel's own brand within Europe and other markets?</h4><p>At Vestel, we call it the “hybrid model;" we produce under other brands, under our own brands, and under licensed brands. I believe it is a unique system. What you normally hear is that you should be either an own-brand company or an OEM/ODM company; however, Vestel shows that this kind of hybrid model is also possible. You can use your own brands and produce for other brands. But when we say produce for other brands, it doesn't mean we are only a manufacturer. Now what we call ourselves is an OEM, or even OEM 2 or 3. We design the product, we produce the product, and in some cases we even market the product for the brand owners. This places us two steps ahead of only being an OEM. Vestel is one of the pioneers in this respect. For example, we license Sharp for white goods across Europe. That means we design, manufacture, and market Sharp products, and the Telefunken brand, in Europe in electronics. We will continue this way, but, of course, now we are also promoting our brand in Vestel, in Turkey, in neighboring countries and we are also considering marketing Vestel in other countries. It is a matter of time. </p><h4>How does Vestel use R&amp;D to remain innovative and competitive?</h4><p>This is a crucial issue in every company operating in consumer electronics or domestic appliances. We have to have strong R&amp;D, which is one of the reasons why Vestel is so successful. Right from the beginning, we gave the utmost importance to R&amp;D; our R&amp;D department is one of the largest in Turkey, employing almost 1,200 engineers in several locations. However, we still have to increase these numbers, because the customers' requests change frequently, and in order to incorporate these changes in your products you need a strong R&amp;D force. It is sometimes technology-driven products, sometimes market-driven, but these days the technology is moving so fast that if you don't follow it closely, you may fall behind the trend. And, of course, the product management group does a similar thing. It is the largest challenge to keep up with technology and features. TVs are changing almost every six months, and you have to introduce new models all the time; the same goes for mobile phones. In white goods, it is a bit better from the manufacturer's point of view, because you normally use your refrigerator or your washing machine for a few years at least. In the white goods area, the quality and the level of service must be perfect, and people are requesting more features at a lower price; therefore, you have got to have continuous cost reduction systems to compete with other products price-wise and feature-wise. It is a strong yet difficult market. And the solution is R&amp;D.</p><h4>With the new Venus phone model coming out, how does Vestel plan to compete with the foreign mobile phone operators in the country?</h4><p>We have been manufacturing smart TVs and tablets for some time. Mobile phones are actually similar to them, though you add a SIM-card, an antenna, and some other features. Basically, it is still a smart product, like a tablet, which you can use to talk. This is what we call converging. In consumer electronics converging is what happens with IT products, and I think the mobile phone is the perfect example as well. The consumer's features are merging with IT features in one product, such as the smartphone. First of all, Vestel can't afford not to go into this business; we have to. If you look at the other companies, Samsung or LG for example, they also used to be consumer electronics companies, but now they have moved into the smartphone business. It is a natural and inevitable step for any consumer goods company to be a smartphone manufacturer. Hence, if we can compete in smart TVs and tablets, why can't we compete in smartphones? </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts are Pakistan and Turkey making to further promote their economic and commercial relations?</h4><p>Pakistan and Turkey enjoy a special relationship underpinned by a strong political, institutional, and popular base. We remain committed to translating this existing goodwill into a comprehensive, future-oriented, economically driven partnership between the two countries. It is reassuring that our respective private sectors are gearing up their efforts in consolidating our trade and commercial ties. The two governments should aim to provide greater facilitative frameworks to actively encourage the private sector-led process of economic and commercial cooperation. Our government is committed to providing facilitative frameworks, especially on bilateral trade, that will result in substantially enhancing economic ties.</p><h4>Education has become Pakistan's top priority in ensuring equal opportunity and social justice. What is the importance of Turkish support and technical assistance in transforming Pakistan's education system?</h4><p>Our social welfare agenda aims at providing human welfare by providing basic social services to all of our citizens. With knowledge becoming the key driver of socio-economic development in the 21st Century, education is our number one national priority. We are aligning our policies and strategies to allocate adequate financial resources, initiate institutional reforms, monitor effective implementation of policies and enforce an effective external monitoring and evaluation system. Our two educational systems have comparative advantages. Cooperation in education in the framework of bilateral cultural agreement shall be mutually beneficial. In addition, an increasing number of students are joining universities in both countries on scholarships as well as on a self-financing basis.</p><h4>During the recent meeting in Ankara, the Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu assured Pakistan about extending support for projects producing electricity, including coal-based and hydropower plants. What is your prospect for the future collaboration of the two nations in the energy sector?</h4><p>There is a gap between our energy production and requirements. Through national consensus, we have developed a comprehensive energy policy with focus on producing cheaper and clean energy. New projects are initiated to produce coal, hydroelectric, and renewable energy. Turkey, with vast experience in the energy sector, is a natural partner for Pakistan.</p><h4>Many Turkish entrepreneurs invest in Pakistan, especially in energy, infrastructure, engineering, and agro-based industry. Why is Pakistan an attractive destination for Turkish investors and what is your outlook for the future of capital flows between the two countries?</h4><p>Pakistan is the sixth largest country in terms of population with an estimated ninth largest available work force. Our government offers a very liberal foreign investment regime in the region that allows, among other things, 100% foreign equity with no limit on repatriation of profit and tax holidays in various sectors. It is home to a rapidly growing private sector, leading a fast-paced, market-oriented economy. The potential growth sectors such as infrastructure, power, and natural resources are open to large-scale investments. We offer prospects of co-production, joint ventures with local partners, and joint marketing arrangements. We also provide exclusive economic zones and infrastructure subsidies as well as R&amp;D support. Through a comprehensive reform program, Pakistan's economy has rapidly recovered and is on the path of steady economic growth. The Pakistan rupee has appreciated against the dollar, the Karachi Stock Exchange is at an all-time high, FDI is on the rise, and our foreign exchange reserves are improving. All these indicators make Pakistan an attractive investment destination. With the growing people-to-people contact through increased frequency of flights between Pakistan and Turkey, there is a growing interest in the Turkish private sector for partnership and investment. Vast opportunities exist in diverse fields such as energy, infrastructure, municipal services, and agro-based industry. We encourage the Turkish private sector to avail itself of these ideal conditions for trade and investment in Pakistan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[making-an-impact]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Praxair has been listed as one of the best companies to work for in Mexico. What is the company doing in that regard?</h4><p><span></span>There are three pillars on which the foundation of our business rests. First is our people. We are committed to finding and developing talented people from diverse backgrounds who use their abilities to make an impact and help our company be more successful. We are very proud to have been ranked by Expansion Magazine as #7 on its Top Companies in Mexico list. This ranking is primarily based on employee feedback, which makes it incredibly valuable. It is a testament to the strong sense of unity, pride, and community that runs throughout our organization. The second pillar concerns innovation, productivity, and sustainability. At its core, these principles represent a relentless focus on improvement at all levels. The third and final pillar is safety, integrity, and compliance. At Praxair this simply means doing the right thing, all the time, with no exceptions.</p><h4>To what degree do you agree that Mexico is a source of talented employees?</h4><p>Mexico has been an excellent source of talent as evidenced by the amount of key leaders we have “exported" to other parts of the world be it Asia, Europe, the US, or other parts of Latin America. Three of Praxair's top executives are from Mexico, including our general counsel, vice president of global procurement, and the vice president of global operations excellence. There is an excellent talent pool here and it is our responsibility to attract and retain the most talented. We partner with local universities to secure the best talent and engage our employees continuously with training, community outreach programs, and talent development to help them grow and enable them to make a real impact on our business.</p><h4>Last year the total sales of the group reached $12 billion. How did Mexico contribute to that?</h4><p>Praxair operates in more than 50 countries and Mexico is one of the most attractive countries in our global portfolio. Mexico accounts for approximately 6% of total company revenues. Praxair is the only fully integrated industrial gas business in North America, and we work closely with our North American affiliates. We have over 300 production, distribution, and sales sites. For over 40 years, we have invested in Mexico by delivering products, applications technology, productivity, and reliability to over 35,000 customers. And within each industry we serve, we pride ourselves on having experts and unique applications to help our customers become more efficient. Some of those include oxy-combustion technology in steel and glass that lowers energy consumption, improving production throughput, and a range of welding applications and automation solutions we offer the metal fabrication market, which can help reduce labor-intensive operations and consumable waste. We combine this solution-based approach with world-class safety and reliability of service along with partnerships in sustainability and community engagement that create lasting and long-term relationships with our customers, employees, and the communities that we serve.</p><h4>What percentage of your production is currently exported?</h4><p>We export some specialty products to the US, South America, and the Caribbean, as we have one of the most sophisticated specialty gas plants in the region, but our exports overall are a relatively small portion as we mainly serve customers in Mexico.</p><h4>How has the year 2015 started for Praxair Mexico and what are your expectations for the rest of the year?</h4><p>We have performed well thus far and are seeing growth in many of our principal market segments. And in my opinion, Mexico has simply some of the best long-term fundamentals for sustained economic growth. For Praxair specifically, this will mean continued robust activity in the manufacturing sector at all levels. Additionally, we expect there to be a resurgence of investment in the energy sector by PEMEX as well as the private participants. We are also leveraging our relationships from other Praxair regions around the world to proactively reach the many new customers entering in this economy as a result of the most recent energy reforms. We expect to see a strong demand in the upstream sector as our nitrogen and carbon dioxide applications play a crucial role in maximizing production in oil and gas fields. We foresee new demand for hydrogen supply as the refineries in Mexico undergo much needed transformation to increase utilization and meet new clean fuel standards. Overall, I remain quite bullish on our growth outlook.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How will foreign investment into Iran evolve in the next five years?</h4><p>Well, if we get through with these sanctions, I'm sure it will happen, but up to now, we think that our friends in neighboring countries are really willing to extend their cooperation for investment. In our sector—industry, mining, and trade—we are expecting to have $3 billion of foreign investment per year, starting from 2016. It will be a beginning for cooperation. Probably in the beginning it will go a little slowly, but gradually it will speed up, especially from our neighboring countries like the UAE. I know we have lots of friends who want to invest, but could not because of the sanctions. For instance, tourism has good potential in Iran, but we need hotels and other facilities. I know that our neighboring Arab countries always want to come and build hotels, so it's in many sectors, not just industry.</p><h4>How would you assess your economic relationship with the UAE?</h4><p>We hope it will improve. There are many Iranian companies there. They used to work with Iran. There are many international companies there that use to work with us. But, we are looking for a new type of cooperation for the long term. We had a relationship with the Emirates because we couldn't buy directly from certain countries. That will not continue, but Emirati companies are still welcome to come and invest. Here is an industrial country that respects the neighboring countries. We have lots of young engineers and educated people. More than 60% of our university graduates are women! It's hard to find jobs for all of them. Back during the revolution, we had less than 25% of our university students as females, but now it's 64%. They are all eager to study and become physicians, doctors, engineers, and so on. They are all there and I think this is a good capacity that can be utilized for more cooperation. I became Minister of Labour when I was 33 years old, just after the revolution. I was also Deputy Minister of Petroleum and Minister of Industry and Trade with a wide experience in different industries. I even retired for a while, but then got called back. In all this time, we have always tried to have the best relationship with our neighbors. A year and a half ago, I met with Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum to talk about our relations during the sanctions, but they could not because their banks were afraid of upsetting the US. Today, I'm sure that this will improve again. We can produce and export gas to countries that have a lack of supply, including the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	What priorities have you set for the National Arts Council for 2015 and 2016?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>For the first time in a long while, the council has been allocated considerable funding. And one of our main interests is to support rural artists, as this is a huge country with artists located across every province and village. Today many associate the term music with the contemporary scene, but there are musicians in villages that have been writing and composing music for a long time. Some of the programs we are launching today are based in rural areas. We have supported rural art festivals and music workshops in isolated areas not considered before, which is a major step forward. The other thing that we are trying to do is to leverage what we have received from the government by partnering with other institutions, making sure that we maximize our resources. We now have major partnerships with companies like Zambian Breweries, which supports the music industry through the Zambia Music Awards. We also have a partnership with Barclay's Bank, which supports the visual arts in the form of Atelier, a continent-wide visual arts competition and skills upgrading program. We are currently starting a program in partnership with the British Council, in regard to Business Arts Partnerships and audience development. This will assist artists who are running festivals, events, galleries, or any spaces or activities to creative partnerships and build their audience. This will be realized together with Ghana, Zambia, and South Africa.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What role can the private sector play in developing the arts and culture?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>We have partnered with Business Arts South Africa, and this has allowed us to leverage the private sector in a focused and transparent way. Sometimes the private sector does not know how to engage with the arts, but I cannot imagine significant art development without the involvement of the private sector. In terms of the government, we have recently signed an MoU with the National Arts Council of the Seychelles, and have already sent two artists to attend events there. We staged an exhibition there and have been invited back, confirming the success of the endeavor. Meanwhile, individuals are also being sent here for training in gallery management as we boast quite a number of galleries and feel the owners should benefit from externally gained experience. There are also governmental programs that we are running in partnership with China.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>How can arts and culture support the economic development of the country?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>There are a huge number of people employed in the local arts and culture sector, but the figure could rise further. We are working to ensure that the government passes the new act and turns this into a more successful industry, leading people to understand that this creates employment. The copyright industries of Kenya and Nigeria are massive, and we will be pushing for a situation like that.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What is the best way of exporting Zambian culture and arts abroad?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>One thing we were lobbying for was to link up with the Ministry of Tourism to take advantage of the synergies that such a partnership could generate. We want to make sure that where possible this synergy generates employment. People buy touristic experiences through the arts, be it through painting, theater, the culinary arts, and so on. This new legislation will create much of the impetus required, I believe that we are close to developing an artistic sea change.
</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>
	<span></span>I hope that supportive legislation is passed, as we are also hoping that this financial year will be a rather more positive, and that we will be able to reach more artists. And meanwhile, for the first time ever we have our own national gallery, and we hope to accomplish more than last year in terms of fostering and supporting skills, training, and education.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Ministry has recently updated the education syllabus. What was the main reason behind this decision?</h4><p><span></span>We wanted to tackle the problem of our children coming into the school system unprepared, as well as to make the program more responsive to the future social and economic demands of our people. We have introduced ICT training into our schools now as we are aware of the importance of this technology. We also want to promote subjects like mathematics and science in secondary schools, and we want to introduce a two-tier system of education where a student, after the Grade 7 examination and moving to secondary school, can chose whether to take the academic route or a vocational route. We have also introduced adult literacy in our school system, so we are continuously promoting life-long learning.</p><h4>How would you describe the quantity and quality of the teachers available in the education sector in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span>The number needs to be improved to deal with our growing population, as does the quality. Quality is of course a relative term. Currently, we have teachers who are comfortable teaching at their schools, but there is a broader need for us to improve our teachers' qualifications. Our total staff body has around 94,000 teachers, but that remains insufficient. There is a need for us to raise this number, not only at the primary or secondary level, but even more so at the tertiary level. At the Master's and PhD level, we are also understaffed. And meanwhile, research is also an area that needs improvement.</p><h4>How would you describe science and education in Zambia at this time?</h4><p><span></span>The country has been focused on basic education to reach the Millenium Development Goal 2, which we have achieved. Because of that, other areas such as secondary education have been neglected. Today, only about 38-40% of those who finish primary school move on to secondary education centers, and only 8-10% of those finishing secondary school go into tertiary or higher learning. There is a need for us to invest in infrastructure, particularly at the upper secondary and tertiary levels. We are doing our best to build the brick and mortar infrastructure, but we need to find partners who will work with us in Public Private Partnerships.</p><h4>To what extent is the government investing in e-Learning to reach more remote areas?</h4><p><span></span>We have established the ICT component of our curriculum already, but ICT comes with a requirement for hardware and software equipment. We are able to develop software materials for our students, but are facing a challenge in sourcing the necessary hardware.  To complement this, the government has launched an ambitious program for the establishment of new universities.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's strategy for reducing the drop out rate after secondary education, especially among women?</h4><p><span></span>Women have the choice to proceed to higher education or an institute of higher learning, but when they are not able to proceed, we have skills training institutions available within our Ministry, and from other ministries such as the Ministry of Youth and Sport, or the Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health, and even in the Ministry of Agriculture. At the secondary level of the curriculum we are promoting social subjects such as home economics, commercial subjects like accounting, business studies, and technical and vocational skills. Even if they fail to pass the process to enter tertiary studies, women are therefore able to learn life-sustaining skills.</p><h4>How can the Ministry bring science closer to rural communities?</h4><p><span></span>Science is taught in schools throughout the country, including minor environmental science. This is a general science curriculum that encompasses biology, chemistry, and physics. They are not just learning it as science, but as an applied science that they can use for innovation and creativity. For the general population, we educate people on hygiene, for example, which is also a kind of science. We have a problem with climate change, and are able to create a stronger awareness of that issue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the pharmaceutical market in Zambia? </h4><p>About 20 years ago, the pharmaceutical market was not very well organized. Today, as you can imagine, the pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated. Every product imported and brought to Zambia has to be registered and that is a long process, requiring clinical studies that conduct trial runs and look at bioequalancy, side effects and other the scientific data. We are regulated by the Zambia Medicines Regulatory Authority (ZAMRA), which has been successful in cutting down illegal imports of medicines to a large extent, which in turn has benefited the formal sector. Zambians have also benefited, knowing that most medicines they procure from a registered pharmacy/hospital or Ccinic are registered, legitimate, and safe to use. </p><h4>More than 90% of the country's pharmaceuticals are supplied through imports. What is your company's market share of these imports?</h4><p>Almost all medicine is imported into Zambia because our manufacturing sector is still very small. The government is the primary importer, because most people rely on government hospitals and public medical services in Zambia. As a result, our share at macro level is relatively small. However, out of the private market, we control a considerable share. Our core business at Sterelin is international branded medicines; we do not focus on generic medicines. Admittedly, branded medicines are more expensive, but they come from the original inventors of those products and carry a high quality standard. Over the years, we have made these international branded medicines more affordable to a wider segment of the Zambian population. People who could not even consider buying an international brand before are now able to afford it. We have a high share of the branded international medicines on the private market. There are between 30 and 50 registered pharmaceutical import companies, of which about ten are active key importers distributors, although all mainly deal with generics. We are the only company in Zambia that specializes in a wide portfolio of international brands in the fields of medicine, hospital equipment, diagnostics, and laboratory reagents and consumables and nutritionals.</p><h4>Sterelin is working with the government, NGOs and the private sector. What is the balance of your clients?</h4><p>We have four main customer categories. The first is the government, namely the Ministry of Health, which is our single largest customer; the private sector comprises mainly retail pharmacies, private hospitals and clinics, various institutions, organizations, and companies. Another sector comprises NGOs, and mission hospitals and donor agencies. I would say the government accounts for about 30% of our business, 60% is private, and the remainder are various NGOs and mission hospitals. These customers are located all over the country, and we have the additional challenge of distributing across these different regions. Transportation is a major challenge, because when fuel costs go up, this affects the overall delivery costs of medicines. The aim of setting up a new branch in the Copperbelt was partly to mitigate these transportation challenges. We successfully cover and serve the whole country with our own fleet of vehicles and also through the outsourcing of transportation services to specialized pharmaceutical distribution companies. Added to this are our non-pharmaceutical products, which I mentioned earlier, as all of those have to be distributed to the major supermarket outlets throughout the country. </p><h4>As an importer, how has the fluctuation of the kwacha impacted your operations?</h4><p>We are going through some of the toughest times an import company can face. The kwacha has depreciated by about 30% over the past five or six months. Even today, some of the payments being recovered from our customers are for goods supplied when the exchange rate was at 6 to the US dollar, and with that money we have to pay suppliers at 7.9 to the dollar. It is an extremely difficult situation, but we will survive, and hopefully it will be temporary. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[whats-your-beef]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zambeef's profit grew by 56% over the first half of this financial year. What would you say are the main reasons behind this success?</h4><p><span></span>Zambeef's 56% rise in profit for the first half of the financial year was boosted by increased sales in our core meat business. We turned a profit of $9.79 million before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITA) in the six months to March 31, 2015, up 56% compared with the same period of last year. We also attribute the rise in earnings to strong sales of cold chain meat and dairy products and continued tight control of administrative costs. Zambeef has taken a number of bold steps forward. Our financial performance is significantly higher than in the same period of the previous financial year, and we also closed on the sale of our subsidiary company, Zamanita Ltd. This sale is in line with the strategic aim of unlocking value and capital gains from within the group and reducing the dollar gearing of the business.</p><h4>How has the demand for food products evolved in the country and where does Zambeef stand in regards to satisfying the local demand?</h4><p><span></span>Zambeef operates in some of the fastest growing parts of the world, and we have every intention to be an important player in meeting the increasing demand for food products. With the sale of Zamanita to Cargil, Inc., our management will be able to focus on driving our core business of production, processing, and distribution of cold chain meat and dairy products. The sale will also reduce dollar gearing and make our earnings less susceptible to rapid exchange rate movements. </p><h4>You recently commissioned a $1 million state-of-the art crushing and processing plant for palm oil in Mpika. What is the significance of this plant? Can you elaborate on this development?</h4><p><span></span>Zampalm's plant in Mpika is the first palm plantation in Zambia. The plantation has 2,800ha of palm plants, which when harvested will produce crude palm oil—the most basic ingredient in the majority of vegetable oils on the market. A 2-ton-per-hour crushing mill was built this year, with plans for a second plant in 2017 and a larger 10-ton plant the following year. These will increase crude palm oil production to 17,000 tons a year. The total investment cost is estimated at $41.5 million. At current prices, this could generate more than $170 million in revenue over the next decade.</p><h4>The government has recently banned the importation of edible oils. Is this investment an answer to supply the local demand?</h4><p><span></span>Crude palm oil imports currently amount to over $70 million annually. More than half of Zambia's edible oil consumption is imported from the Far East, East Africa and South Africa. The market for edible oils in Zambia is estimated at 120,000 tons per year, and this is expected to grow as the country continues to develop. Palm oil is the world's most used vegetable oil and its derivatives are used in dynamic ways. It can be used as preservatives and antioxidants and can be found in personal care products such as shampoos and cosmetics. It is also used as a renewable fuel, and is industrially in lubricants, paints, and inks. Once fully operational, the plantation will replace 70,000 tons of imported cooking oil. By increasing domestic production, it will save the country around $70 million in foreign exchange outflows every year. </p><h4>Transport and infrastructure is extremely important for the commercialization of agricultural products. Is the sector making the best use of the current infrastructure?</h4><p><span></span>The farms are fully mechanized and our focus on precise farming techniques makes these facilities world-class assets. The abundance of water has enabled Zambeef to develop the irrigation potential of our farms and reduce many weather-related risks. Our Mpongwe farm continues to produce yields that are comparable with the industrialized world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What would you say are the peculiarities of the Zambian market and the most common concerns of a foreign company keen to enter the country?</h4><p><span></span>Often companies are concerned about indigenization laws. Currently, Zambia doesn't have any of these with the exception of the Citizens Economic Empowerment Commission requirements, whereby companies that are locally owned, influenced or managed have a greater chance of doing business with the government. There are also investor-friendly labor laws, and no exchange control provisions. Investors are often interested in the availability of tax incentives, with the Zambia Development Agency incentives available (including up to five years free of corporate taxes, and 10 years at a reduced corporate tax rate) for investors in priority sectors and areas. Zambia also has abundant natural resources, not just in copper, but also in other natural resources. Agriculture in particular is a huge potential growth area with significant amounts of unutilized arable land and large freshwater resources. One area of concern for foreign investors is to ensure that there is stability from a governmental and policy perspective. This has been highlighted with the recent introduction of the new mining tax regime, which has been controversial. However, the new President has publicly indicated his willingness to engage with the mining companies on this, which should help to reassure investors. </p><h4>How would you assess the current level of foreign interest in the country and what needs to be done by both public and private sectors to incentivize and improve the framework for foreign investors?</h4><p><span></span>The level of foreign interest in the country is high. As a professional services firm, KPMG has advised several incoming potential investors, and the number is growing. Zambia is renowned regionally for being politically stable, which appeals to investors wishing to invest in the Southern African region. From the public sector, as mentioned above, policy stability is vital, especially in allowing foreign investors to produce reliable financing models. Meanwhile, certain basic services like internet connectivity and power and water supply should be enhanced. However, having said that, the ease of doing business in Zambia has improved over the years, and the government has been taking steps to improve this, for example, with the creation of the Zambia Development Agency and the One Stop Shops (combining PACRA, ZRA, ZDA offices). Government is also encouraging Public-Private partnerships, for example, with the border posts that have been privately funded, but that will be transferred to public ownership in due course. </p><h4>What regulatory changes are we likely to see in Zambia in the near future?</h4><p><span></span>A new Companies Bill has been devised to broaden the duties and responsibilities of directors. Additionally, a new Insurance Bill seeks to restrict foreign shareholdings, and will require prior regulatory approval of CEOs, senior personnel and auditors, although it is unclear whether this particular bill will progress. As mentioned above, the mining tax regime may also change depending on the outcome of the government's discussions with business. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>Another election is due in just over a year, which we expect to be hotly contested but relatively peaceful. In the meantime, we expect greater policy stability from the government, which should hopefully attract more investment into the country. The Zambian economy will continue to grow, and we expect KPMG to grow along with the economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your key priorities for next year?</h4><p><span></span>We have devised key strategies for the next five years to promote the growth of the tourism sector in Zambia. One component involves creating an environment conducive for investment in the tourism sector through policy review, where new tourism and hospitality acts will have been adopted and enacted by 2015. Work is also underway to review the national parks and policy and to facilitate the adoption of new instruments before the end of 2016. Secondly, new financing instruments are coming in that will increase funding for tourism research, development, infrastructure, capacity building, and marketing. Third, there is a new provision to empower the Zambian Tourism Agency to open up representative offices in key source markets, which is currently being done in Zambian missions abroad. Fourth, the Ministry is also initiating projects to promote investment in hotels. Responses have been positive so far from local investors and international brand hotels such as the Hilton and Best Western, and additional investments are under negotiation. We are also promoting the repositioning of the business tourism sector by promoting investment in convention sectors and introducing special-purpose vehicles to promote and market Zambia as a destination of choice for MICE tourism. Furthermore, work is underway to draft a national tourism master plan and lay the long-term foundations of the development of the tourism sector. Lastly, we are working to introduce an electronic visa system which will facilitate faster processing of visas for tourists. We hope to see this scheme in operation by 2016. Zambia and Zimbabwe have been piloting the KAZA Uni-visa project, currently under evaluation; the project phase will end in May 2015. Through this project, a tourist can purchase a visa on arrival for $50 for entry to both Zambia and Zimbabwe for up to 30 days. </p><h4>What are the advantages of Zambia as a tourism destination?</h4><p><span></span>Zambia has a number of advantages, including its friendly and welcoming people who make tourists feel at home. Zambia is a highly peaceful country with a stable economy. It is also home to the iconic Victoria Falls, one of the seven natural wonders of the world. We have untapped segments of cultural tourism, which is being refined as a tourist product. We also have a spectacular wildlife offering and pristine lands with almost 20 national parks, 36 game management areas, one bird sanctuary and numerous plants and animals, including endangered species only found in these areas.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the contribution of tourism to the country's GDP?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Tourism is regarded as one of the ministries mandated to promote sustainable economic development and job creation. Therefore, the establishment of the Ministry and the broadening of its mandate to incorporate arts and culture is significant to ensure that the contribution to the sector widens equally. Currently, the tourism sector accounts for 3.1% of GDP, and last year accounted for about 2.7%. The increase came from a number of factors and incentives, including the promotion of community participation in the sector and enabling an environment for PPPs, as well as promoting direct investment in the sector. Zambia and Zimbabwe co-hosted the UN World Tourism Organization's assembly, which made our country recognized on the world tourism market. With its natural resources and endowments, Zambia is now on the map to rapidly developing tourism.</p><h4>The KAZA Uni-visa between Zambia and Zimbabwe was recently launched. What other common projects are you working on to maximize the potential of the Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area?</h4><p><span></span>The Kavango-Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area, or KAZA, has several programs and projects involving conservation and marketing. Within the scope of KAZA, Zambia is in the process of establishing tourism development corridor projects, one spanning the Southern and Western provinces and the other spanning Northern, Luapula, and Muchinga provinces. Through these projects, which will have their own special-purpose vehicle, we will develop infrastructure and new tourism products and packages to increase the length of stay and purchases by tourists. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the center evolved over the past year? </h4><p>In August 2014, we introduced long-distance learning programs, initially with three degrees in financial services, computing with education, and accounting with education. The two programs that have an educational component are particularly interesting to us because we targeted teachers of commercial or ICT-related subjects in high schools. These teachers are eager to study these programs, but cannot attend full-time education, as they are too busy working. For this reason distance learning has emerged as a promising solution. The three programs started out with 44 students, but these numbers quickly grew to around 100. We have four new degree programs that will start in August 2015, including a Bachelor's in accounting, which will be run in collaboration with the Zambia Institute of Chartered Accountants (ZiCA), a Bachelor's degree in Business Entrepreneurship, a Bachelor's in Business Administration and a Bachelor's degree in accounting and finance. We are already offering a Bachelor of Business Studies in partnership with the University of Greenwich. The second major development is that we have begun to implement a new organizational structure for the institution in response to the growth of the institution and the increasing number of programs. We decided to establish directorates for administration; consultancy, research and distance education; and finance, as well as dedicated directorates for academic and professional programs.</p><h4>What is your strategy for postgraduate studies?</h4><p><span></span>Three members of our staff have completed their PhD studies in the past year. We have not introduced any postgraduate programs to date, but have a postgraduate MBA/MA program with the University of Greenwich, as well as a Master of Science degree in Information Systems Management, again with the University of Greenwich. Several members of our staff are undertaking PhD studies, thus this is an area we are expanding. Further we are specifically developing a postgraduate degree in project management. For the future, the vision is to introduce postgraduate programs in accountancy in addition to other subjects.</p><h4>Are you looking to find new partnerships?</h4><p><span></span>Certain partnerships have not worked out very well, so we want to review them. There are opportunities to partner with some institutions in the UK and to source leadership training opportunities from there. We will also be looking to South Africa and the Far East.</p><h4>What role does research play within the center?</h4><p><span></span>In the ZCAS Legal Mandate, encapsulated in the ZCAS Act, it says that the organization should be involved in research and put out research that feeds into policy formulation in the country. Unfortunately, since ZCAS was set up 27 years ago, this is an activity that has not really taken precedence or received adequate attention. In an effort to try and get this activity off the ground, we have signed an MOU with ZIPAR, the Zambian Institute for Policy Analysis and Research. We want to work with them so that my staff can be acquainted with research methods and practices.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>We would like to see some publications coming out of the research that will be done by ZCAS staff within a year's time. I am looking to see more PhD students qualifying from ZCAS also. We are already thinking about programs that we will be introducing next year, and already have about three on the table that we are working on. Ultimately, I am hoping that ZCAS will have its own mandate to award degrees, which we are currently unable to do. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the production capacity and productivity of the NCZ plant? </h4><p><span></span>Nitrogen Chemicals of Zambia have been in existence since 1970, and started with the production of ammonia nitrate as the main product. The mines were our main customers and agriculture was the second sector. In 1981 we placed more emphasis on agriculture and expanded our plant, but by 1990 the facilities required major renovation. Currently, NCZ produces ammonium nitrate fertilizer, ammonium nitrate blasting agent, which is used by the mines and we also produce compound fertilizers. Production levels were low in the beginning due to the challenges that were inherent at design stage. However, at present, production levels have increased four-fold. We used to operate at 15 tons per hour production of NPK Fertilizers, and now we are running at 60 tons per hour. We are aiming at a production rate of 65-70 tons per hour. At this point in time we have increased annual capacity of 142,000 tons to over 400,000 tons using already installed equipment and are working to capacity. </p><h4><span></span>A significant amount of energy is used in the manufacture of fertilizer. How do you cope with the energy challenges that we have seen in the country recently?</h4><p><span></span>The government is trying to accommodate us, and so far we have not experienced some of the problems industries can have. We are able to run at high production rates for 24 hours with the available power. Consequently, high production rates reduce the time needed to fulfill the contractual obligations. This industry is of wider strategic importance to the economy of Zambia, and to agriculture in particular. Since we want to make agriculture the mainstay of the economy, our company must then be prioritized in terms of energy.</p><h4><span></span>To what extent are you supporting the mining industry at present?</h4><p><span></span>We support mining through the provision of raw materials used in explosives. This is another private partnership, but we have partnered with African Explosives Limited, based in Mufulira, in a 10-year contract to supply them with raw materials. Apart from African Explosives, we are also set to supply ammonium nitrate to a company called Solar Explochem, and another called Orica. Apart from those three, there are other smaller organizations using our products, such as quarry companies, which blast to produce stones and quarry dust, as well as products for the construction industry, be it for roads or construction. We therefore support a cross-section of the construction industry, as well as the mining industry.</p><h4>What should be done to further develop the agricultural sector and manufacturing in Zambia?</h4><p><span></span>We should encourage more people to enter the agricultural sector. Many still think of it in terms of maize or corn alone, but it also encompasses dairy farming, pig farming, animal husbandry and more. People should be encouraged to enter these segments, because the population is growing rapidly and people need food. The government should, for one, remove duties on imported machinery used in the agricultural sector to incentivize investment momentum. Manufacturing is also key; the government needs to draft policies conducive to its growth. If NCZ fails to grow, Zambia will remain an import-oriented economy in terms of fertilizers and other chemicals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the Farming Block Development Program and what opportunities are there for international investors within this project?</h4><p>We have identified ten farming blocks and we have an eleventh block on the drawing board. The Nansanga Farming Block in Serenje is well connected by road and electricity has been delivered. We have already allocated pieces of land to small-scale and commercial farmers and we are in the process of awarding 10,000 ha of land to what we refer as a core venture. Our idea is to create a hub and spoke arrangement in the farming blocks in the sense that you have one big player that goes not only into agricultural production, but agro-processing and marketing. In that way, they create an appetite for production in the farming block. The small farmer gains expertise and input from the core venture, which in turn benefits from the production of the small-scale farmer. That is one of the innovations that we have come up with to try and attract local and foreign investment into the agriculture and agro-processing industry. Zambia's tax regime has been friendly to the agricultural sector. Whereas all industries pay a 35% to 40% income tax rate, the agricultural sector is charged 10%.</p><h4>Which commodities hold the biggest potential for the farming block development areas?</h4><p>The commodities that we are promoting are oil seed, soya, sunflower, cowpeas, and we are also promoting cassava because it has a huge market both locally and regionally. There is also a huge demand for wheat in the sub-region. We are hoping that we can expand the production of wheat for the export market. The production of white maize has stabilized and we are now producing much more than is required for local consumption, which has allowed us to expand into the export market. White maize is not very nutritious though and, to improve on nutritional levels for our people, we are promoting orange maize, which has a higher quantity of vitamin A. Tubers, such as sweet potatoes and Irish potatoes, are also becoming very important. We are promoting potatoes particularly the varieties that are good for processing into crisps. We are working now with National Breweries, which have been conducting experiments that have proved successful with the utilization of sorghum in the production of both opaque and lager beers. There is an imminent malting plant that will be processing barley into malt. Its capacity is 15,000 metric tons per year that is also creating huge demand for barley. Livestock such as cattle, poultry, and sheep and goats have a significant place in the farming blocks and in Zambia generally. Fish farming shall be promoted through Aquaculture Parks.</p><h4>Zambia holds around 40% of the water resources in the SADC region. What efforts is the Ministry making to develop an efficient fishing industry? </h4><p>We are cooperating with a number of bilateral and multilateral organizations, such as FAO, in developing our aquaculture industry. We are doing this both in capture fisheries and in aquaculture. Over the past few years, we have seen an emergence of a number of fish farmers. The government and its cooperating partners are also giving out grants for farmers who intend to go into fish farming. We are in the process of developing Aquaculture Parks which will provide fish farms and fish processing facilities. This year alone, we are recruiting close to 150 Fisheries Extension Workers. Twenty million hectares of land are covered by water in Zambia that we also need to protect. We are coming up with a program for regular and strict policing of fishing on the natural bodies of water. We have a number of colleges that are training people in fish farming and our fisheries department is also conducting research. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most strategic projects in terms of public works that you will inaugurate in the near future?</h4><p>The most strategic projects to be inaugurated in the near future include the rehabilitation and construction of urban and feeder road projects. We are also working on the improvement of urban and rural supply and sanitation projects, as well as housing development, especially for low and middle-income groups. We are active in the construction of engineered landfills for solid waste management, especially in urban areas. In addition, the construction of municipal and auxiliary buildings such as bus stations, fire stations, sports facilities, and shopping malls are key in our development.</p><h4>According to the Central Statistical Office report, Zambia is projected to experience a housing deficit of 3 million by 2030. What are your strategies to improve housing accessibility and affordability to all strata of society?</h4><p>The ministry is currently reviewing the National Housing policy so that it is in line with the current trends in housing development. The housing supply schemes in the country at present are site and service, parastatal, informal, institutional, private, and public housing supply. These schemes are not sufficient to meet the current housing demands. There is a need to recapitalize the Zambia National Building Society, which is a mortgage institution, and at the same time improve the supply of serviced land for housing development. </p><h4>Construction is one of the sectors experiencing the largest growth in the country, and several cement companies are currently making important investments. How do you expect this industry to impact the economic development of Zambia? </h4><p>These developments will have a positive impact on job creation. Additionally, they will advance economic activity, as transport infrastructure is expanded and agricultural production developed. It is a positive process because we expect a lower cost of construction and doing business in general through the encouragement of competition among producers. </p><h4>What projects are of highest priority in terms of national roads?</h4><p>Our priority is to expand the road network to support agricultural and industrial development. In urban areas there is also a need for decongestion of city roads through improved mass transport systems. For heavy industries, roads to link copper mining areas to the rest of the country are required.</p><h4>What are the main strategies that you have set for the ministry to improve the water supply and sanitation in urban and rural areas? </h4><p>In improving the water supply and sanitation the ministry has developed the national urban and rural water and sanitation programs. These are mainly focused on increasing access to clean and safe water and improved sanitation in urban and rural areas, as well as recapitalizing the commercial utility companies to make them viable. </p><h4>What are your personal objectives for the Ministry of Local Government and Housing during your tenure in office? </h4><p>My personal objectives are anchored in the Patriotic Front manifesto of 2011-16. This document gives each minister a road map as to what should be achieved during the tenure of the Patriotic Front government. The PF Government recognizes the critical role of local government as an engine for delivering services, infrastructure, and development to the communities of Zambia. As a signatory to the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration of 1996, Zambia committed itself to promoting decentralization through democratic local authorities and to work toward strengthening the local authorities' financial capacities. That is the major thrust in the administration of local government. Furthermore, we want to help our councils increase the stock of houses that can be offered for rent. One method we are trying to explore to deal with this demand for houses is the public-private partnerships, and the other is the possibility of the government guaranteeing specific loans to enable our councils to build houses. In my tenure, I would like to contribute to establishing a system of local government that will promote local economic development and improve delivery of essential infrastructure and services through local self-government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The vast majority of the supply comes from imports. What are your plans for developing a drug manufacturing industry in Zambia?</h4><p>It is difficult to ensure availability of drugs when you are dependent on sourcing them from abroad. There is a need for some production to be realized in Zambia, although manufacturing in terms of laboratory synthesis is not a realistic proposition for Zambia today. However, in the later  stages of pharmaceutical processing and production there is the possibility of setting up operations here. We need to establish some incentives as part of the Zambian Development Agency related to tax and other critical areas. Secondly, we should work with those who are interested in manufacturing and guide them in areas where they might have a maximum impact by producing locally. The concern about both money and distribution systems is that if you do not define the essential medicines, success is elusive as there are over 3,000  products worldwide, and Zambia cannot afford to buy them all. We have to define essential needs, and there must be absolute availability of those essential medicines.</p><h4>What is the status of your plan to build 650 health posts at an estimated cost of $50 million?</h4><p>We are progressing steadily. In terms of the contract time that we have given to our contractors, we may set April 2016 as the completion date. People have been impatient ever since we announced the plan, but we will do our best to have it ready as soon as possible.</p><h4>What will be the impact of this project once completed?</h4><p>We have promised that the distance, or the radius, around any institution that we can reasonably expect a person to travel when ill is 5km. At present, the average distance is between 40-80km. These 650 posts are meant to address that issue by reducing the distances people travel before they reach a healthcare facility.</p><h4>How will you address the shortage of healthcare professionals?</h4><p>We aim to increase our intake by encouraging both the public and private sector to engage in training. As of today, the number of nurses trained by the private sector is almost the same as those trained by governmental institutions. Unfortunately, health workers also take a long time to train, so we need to persuade our people to be patient. Even if we increase the number of students today, they will not be ready to work immediately.</p><h4>You mentioned the increase in the balance of non-communicable diseases in Zambia. What does that mean for the Ministry?</h4><p>Over the past two years we have taken several steps to address non-communicable diseases. The new Cancer Diseases Hospital that we hope to commission shortly is one of the examples of our efforts. The structure is meant to be more than a hospital; it will be a center of excellence for the prevention and management of cancer.</p><h4>What role do mobile technologies and other new technologies play in providing healthcare to rural areas?</h4><p>We have adopted e-learning, and though our initial effort was perhaps small, we have established five nursing schools and a unit at the University Hospital. This unit is called Tele-Medicine, and will offer the chance for people to access health services remotely by sending images and being assessed online. The potential for ICT solutions is huge, especially in the supply management of drugs. A good control of drug stocks is essential as instant information will allow us to react instantly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What priorities have been set for the NRFA for the next three to four years?</h4><p><span></span>The main task of the NRFA is managing the road fund. Over the coming few years, we will work towards our vision of creating a sustainable road fund. Our key thematic areas are resource mobilization and fiduciary management, while ascertaining value for money. We source funds for the sector from our corporate partners in the form of loans and grants, and from the government through a fuel levy and tolls. Once these funds are accessed, we manage them prudently through accountability measures, transparency, and economic utilization. There is huge demand for roads, as they are the key to economic development. However, there is a gap between demand and supply. At NRFA, we are coming up with creative means of securing funds. Looking ahead, we envision a strengthened road fund based on the user-pay principle.</p><h4>How will the Link Zambia 8000 project improve the efficiency of the road transport sector?</h4><p><span></span>Link Zambia 8000 is one of several projects in the road sector. Link Zambia 8000 will operate like a river basin with tributaries and will enhance trade and reduce transaction costs. Nearly every industry can benefit from roads, especially agriculture and mining. These sectors drive the economy and are dependent on the efficiency of the transport system. Also, we can improve the living standards of people in rural areas by increasing access to more amenities. </p><h4>How do you expect the conditions of the 67,000 km of Zambian road network to evolve in the future?</h4><p><span></span>In general, our paved roads are relative to feeder roads and generally are in good condition. An integral aspect of good road condition is the development of a comprehensive maintenance system, which has since been developed and will be fully supported by NRFA.  A stitch-in-time saves nine.  Thus, the importance of maintenance cannot be over-emphasized. </p><h4>What role can PPPs play in developing Zambia's transportation infrastructure?</h4><p><span></span>There are several forms of PPPs being used in this country; Mongo-Kalabo, L-400, Mansa-Luwingu and Mbala-Nakonde were all funded by some form of PPP. We are not utilizing PPPs to our full potential, however. We need to do more to entice private companies to partner with the government to fund roads in form of PPPs. </p><h4>What will be the impact of the Kazungula bridge project?</h4><p><span></span>If you visit Kazungula today, you will observe a long queue of trucks on both the Botswanan and Zambian side that can occasionally stretch for kilometers. The bridge will reduce the time of border crossings thereby reducing costs for transporters.  The bridge is a strategic link on the North-South Corridor, which, once completed, will enhance trade. </p><h4>What are the main achievements of the NRFA?</h4><p><span></span>The audited accounts have been unqualified since their inception in 2006.   We have successfully coordinated the budgeting process through the road sector annual work plans, the basis for financing the sector. We have also had successful technical audits, have conducted investigations and field visits, and enhanced our internal controls. Additionally, we have created a strong corporate governance system through our code of ethics and we have a strong Integrity Committee, which recently won a Commitment Award from the Anti-Corruption Commission. We have facilitated capacity building of local contractors through support to the National Council for Construction. We have also initiated the Construction Finance Initiative, which is designed to enhance access to financial instruments such as bid bonds, payment guarantees, and performance guarantees by local contractors. More local contractors on board means increased competition and lower unit costs and  can thus do more for the same amount of funding. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>Our expectations for this year are good budgetary releases to the sector coupled with a break-through in complementary alternative funding sources to fully fund the road projects for the year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Rail Talk]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[rail-talk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you give us an update on the progression of the rail and road projects in Zambia?</h4><p>Link Zambia 8000 is a project to ensure the country is linked up through a good road network . To ensure that this large investment is sustainable, we are looking at the rail sector to try to transfer heavy loads that are currently being transferred by the roads to rail. To make this happen we need to rehabilitate the rail network. We have two rail networks in the country right now. One is the Zambia Rail Limited from Chingola to Livingstone and from Livingstone to Mulobezi. The second network is TAZARA that runs from Kapiri Mposhi to Dar es Salaam. Due to upgrades, rail transportation has seen an increase in speed to 70km; by 2016, that will jump to 80km per hour. Through this increase, we will reduce the time goods spend on the rails. We cannot have any sustainable development of the roads without rail. Locomotives are extremely important to trade and to the sustainability of the Link Zambia 8000 project. At the moment there is mining equipment and many vehicles coming by road from Dar es Salaam that could come by rail more safely and cost-effectively. Increasing rail transport will also reduce stress on the roads and road maintenance costs. </p><h4>What specifically needs to be done to make the Kafue River a viable transport route?</h4><p>Kafue comes from the Copperbelt, and there are a lot of bridges along the way. In order to make the river viable for transport, we will need to remove some obstacles, including low bridges. If they're high enough then a small vessel can pass underneath. In the future, we may change the design of bridges with river transport in mind. This year we plan to conduct a feasibility study.</p><h4>In what way is the private sector partnering with the government for Link Zambia 8000 and Pave Zambia 2000?</h4><p>For Link Zambia 8000 and Pave Zambia 2000 we have identified all the major roads, and we have ensured that the projects are open to investment from the private sector. Those roads deemed inadequate by the private sector will be addressed by the government. We are overwhelmed by the level of private interest we have seen from both international and domestic companies.</p><h4>How will the Kazungula Bridge impact trade?</h4><p>The bridge is an important feature because it connects Zambia to Botswana in the south. This project will change the lives of people and ease congestion across the borders. Transit time will be reduced, the border post will ease the flow of goods, and more business opportunities will become available in the area. Both countries will benefit from this development.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities in terms of capacity building for communications infrastructure? </h4><p>This government will ensure that we have proper investment in communications so that every person has access to information. Without proper communications, development is impossible. To run any project effectively you need ICTs, and the use of new technologies will ease the monitoring and execution of projects. Mobile technology is also necessary for the use of mobile money and transfers. We need to invest in improving internet access and services to all strata of society.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our goal is to adopt a multi-modal strategy for transport. The time has come for Zambia to change in a big way, and for the government to better provide for the people. Our president is eager to provide the leadership to ensure that we move in this direction and at a pace to keep up with the rest of the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company performed over the past year?</h4><p>Our business model has grown somewhat as we are now focusing on filmmaking and are in the process of shooting our first feature film. Our idea is to take a bold step toward establishing a tendency toward international standards. We intend to be part of the momentum that launches a dynamic film industry in the region that makes high-quality productions. We feel that we are ready now to create and we are confident about our capabilities. We are in a good place to jump start the industry. Africa is a continent of dance and music, which is why the movie is about dancing. Dance comes from the heart and it is part of us. I am trying to project that and show the world something it has never really seen, but to do this in a very professional way as well. Most of the film will take place in the townships with traditional African dancing. We are hoping to premier next year, and are in production this year.</p><h4>Does Zambia have the kind of potential seen in Bollywood or Nollywood?</h4><p>The focus should be Africa, not just Zambia. South Africa is already light years ahead of us, having developed the industry over a longer period, but I am still surprised that a country of that magnitude is not producing more. Africa is a good platform for Hollywood to get a cheaper deal in production terms.</p><h4>How important are the arts for the economic development of the country?</h4><p>If you look at Nigeria as an example, its music has taken the world by storm. They are making great music and the artists are making a lot of money from this, which is impressive. The film industry has also bolstered the economy, and entertainment has emerged as the country's main export to the US. So I believe that this is a strong model for the cultural development of a nation.</p><h4>What makes Zambian culture unique?</h4><p>Zambia has many tribes that make for a rich cultural diversity. The peaceful nature of the country, as well as its wonderful climate, both affect the culture and our citizens.</p><h4>How can you achieve a balance between tradition and innovation? </h4><p>Developments in ICT have transformed the country for the better, but there have been negative impacts as well. When I go to villages here, where social interactions were once based on communal events, storytelling, and music, technology has today taken over pushing these traditions to the background as the youth increasingly prefer Western culture as seen on TV. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Landmark Developments]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[landmark-developments]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Hai's portfolio of services evolved since last year?</h4><p>First and foremost the company underwent significant change at shareholder level as it became a wholly owned subsidiary of CEC Liquid Telecommunications Limited, which is a 50/50 joint venture of Liquid Telecommunications and Copperbelt Energy Corporation Plc. The shareholder changes took place in March 2015. Consequently, one of the landmark changes the Company made was the renaming and subsequent rebranding from Realtime Zambia to Hai Telecommunications Limited. Hai, which means "I'm alive," is the group's brand name for its pan-African operation. The change also happened at an opportune time and is of strategic significance within a market moving towards consolidation. Up to last year, Hai was focused on selling to a niche market of institutional customers, but since last December we have expanded our portfolio to include fiber optic connections to the mass market. Previously, we had not been involved in the mass market as we lacked the technology to do so. Yet today we have become one of CEC Liquid's reseller's for fiber to the home using their extensive fiber optic access network. The demand for the service has been encouraging as the public is eager buy from us and so far we have been able to make at least five sales per day and our target is to more than double this performance.</p><h4>How has internet penetration evolved since last year?</h4><p>Internet penetration continues to grow in Zambia. Organisations and the public at large are increasingly demanding more broadband services for their business and social needs. In our network alone our internet capacity has grown by about 50% as a result of increasing demand coupled with reducing internet prices.</p><h4>How would you describe the significance of internet for the social and economic development of the country?</h4><p>The internet has become a cross-cutting service and is contributing greatly to an enhanced quality of life in general. It has made it very convenient for us to do research, and it has been crucial to the field of education for gaining knowledge. It has made it easier for the farming community to enquire about such things as agricultural inputs, markets, weather patterns, and soil texture. The internet in the medical field has made it easier to consult doctors remotely. From a social perspective, the internet has become a useful platform for social networking, general communication, IP TV, access to games, and so on. Quite clearly, it is really helping to improve the quality of life.</p><h4>There is a mobile money revolution underway. Is Hai in support?</h4><p>At the moment, we are involved remotely with mobile money through providing connectivity to business houses and financial institutions. They use some of our infrastructure to roll out some of their services. We see mobile money as the wave of the future in handling transactions as we move closer to a cashless society. </p><h4>What should the government do to further support the ICT sector in Zambia?</h4><p>The ICT sector in Zambia continues to enjoy tremendous support from the government, which is helping to spur growth. But I should hasten to mention that this support is in consideration of the fact that our nation's internet penetration levels largely remain low. Therefore, the government has extended to the sector a number of tax incentives for the importation of ICT equipment. The government also relies heavily on ICT services for its own functioning. It is also expected that the government will help increase access to underserved areas; however, one area where we could do better is in the area of relatively higher license fees and corporate tax for the sector. We hope these may be reduced soon so that we can roll out services to more markets and more cost effectively.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the main reason behind the creation of Devalia Group and where does Magic Advertising fit within the organization?</h4><p>V.R. Consultants, a part of the Devalia Group, is involved in consulting for overseas companies wanting to invest in Zambia. It also handles the many agencies of companies from all over world that want to supply their products to Zambia. The Group is also involved in property development, the supply of stationary items through its company Top Shop to government ministries, private companies, and NGOs. Its flagship company, Magic Advertising, is a one-stop shop that manufactures and sets up billboards, vinyl, and banner wide format printing, vehicle branding, telescopic and ordinary flags, printing, and embroidery of t-shirts, caps, mugs, key chains, mouse pads, and many other promotional items. We also do media creations, buying, and product launches.</p><h4>What types of properties are available in your real estate portfolio?</h4><p>We are building the Olympia Plaza Extension in Lusaka, which is a building of 1,500sqm. To make this happen we raised $2 million, and once completed we will put it up for rent. There are some medical specialists from India and Botswana who are interested in building a diagnostic center, and there is also the possibility of building a high-class mini mall. We have plots around Lusaka and will be developing them once this current project is completed. We expect to develop five to six other projects over a period of three to four years. We also have seven large properties in Livingstone, where the Victoria Falls are, and have let them out.</p><h4>How do you see the real estate market evolving in Lusaka over the coming years?</h4><p>Competition is increasing in the sector. There is a big chain from Botswana with which we have been in contact about expansion. It wants to open 50 stores in Zambia, so there is a possibility that we could become its local representatives. </p><h4>What inspires you when choosing a new sector to enter?</h4><p>I picked up my entrepreneurial spirit from my father, and have tried my hand at many different sectors. I was only 22 years old when I started my business, but I had been learning how it worked since I was a child. The situation in the country also changes. A couple of decades ago Zambia was a $2 billion economy, but today it is a $26 billion economy. There is more money circulating, and it is a virgin country for investment. There is no exchange control, and these are the opportunities we see in Zambia that as yet have not been adequately marketed to the wider world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>This year we became more involved in real estate. We are trying to have success in this area and I have three or four groups, including one from Sudan that is keen to start a multi-investment project in a five-star hotel close to the airport, as well as set up a vehicle lubrication manufacturing plant. And meanwhile, hospitals from India also want to invest in Zambia, and I hope I will be there to support these new ventures. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services for the next year?</h4><p>The main challenges faced by the industry are finding resources to operate the various interconnected institutions such as the Times of Zambia and the Zambia Daily Mail. All media houses face obstacles in terms of finances and equipment. The balance sheets for the four major media houses are in the negative and are not attracting meaningful investment. As a result they are unable to borrow from the capital markets because of the state of their finances. These are historic debts, and we are keen to negotiate for debt to be transferred into shares in these entities. Then we can look into floating certain companies to the general public and raising foreign capitalization. As soon as the cabinet gives its approval, this process will commence.</p><h4>What is the status of the digital migration project?</h4><p>That is the largest program we are working on today. The first phase is worth close to $9 million and the second and third phases are worth more than $150 million. The second phase will encompass all areas of Zambia, that is, the whole country will have digital television. We recently completed phase one, and we switched urban areas to digital television in June before the deadline. Financing for the remaining phases will be done through Exim Bank of China. </p><h4>What role does media and information transparency play in the socio-economic development of the country?</h4><p>The media naturally has considerable influence on the socioeconomic development of the country. A healthy media is aware of its rights to express a viewpoint, but should also be aware of potential damage that can be done to the broader economy by presenting the nation in negative light. This has the potential to impact investor interest negatively. On the social front, the media is important in terms of its role in informing the general public of key domestic developments and government programs. The media is the Fourth Estate after the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature; meaning that the media provides the watchdog role for the arms of government and society as a whole. The media also plays the role of being the marketplace of ideas where people are provided with information for them to make informed decisions.</p><h4>What role is the radio playing in the dissemination of information given the low levels of literacy in Zambia?</h4><p>Although we are migrating from analogue to digital broadcasting, since independence, not all citizens have had access to radio because transmitters were not spread out to all areas of the country. The government has since installed transmitters and is still installing through ZNBC to all areas that have faced this challenge. I recently officiated at the installation of transmitters in Mufumbwe North Western Province and my predecessors have officiated in Shang'ombo, Chilubi, Mulobezi, Luwingu, and Shiwang'andu, among others. The government has also operationalized the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to quicken the pace of giving radio licences to would-be owners of private radio stations and so 71 radio stations are operational through-out the country. This has meant people accessing radio in almost all parts of the country and this means they are given a wider platform for them to make their decisions.</p><h4>How is the e-government project set to improve information flow between the government and the public?</h4><p>The Zambian government has embarked on a project to take government services closer to the people through an ICT platform called Government Wide Area Network. Under this platform, 24 Government ministries and other government institutions have been interconnected in Lusaka. The program will cover all provincial centers and the entire country. The project will result in a high capacity transport tier to accommodate and carry all planned government ICT applications and services such as email, e-health, and e-education, reduced internet costs, and a stable, centralised, and fast internet connection to all sites once the project is complete.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>My expectation is that by the end of the year we shall have a contractor on our digital migration sites to role-out phase two and three of our digital migration project. My expectation also is that our economy will grow by between 7% and 8% in the coming year, and this will provide the state with sufficient funds to run the social and economic programs of the country. We are interdependent with other countries, and aim to make good use of international practices and set an example for the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Zambia for the overall strategy of PUMA in Africa?</h4><p>In Africa, PUMA Energy is currently present in 18 countries. Its operations in Zambia are particularly important because Zambia is the second largest producer of copper in Africa and the mining sector is a crucially important sector for us. As an oil company, we provide fuel to the main mines in Zambia. The operational excellence we have built in Zambia serves as a benchmark allowing us to acquire new customers in other African countries, and even in other continents. We have a presence in all the countries of southern Africa and in 18 nations across the continent. </p><h4>What have been the main growth drivers in Zambia?</h4><p>The retail segment has been a key engine of the economy. Zambia ranks among the top 10 countries in Africa experiencing the highest GDP growth. The middle class is growing in Zambia and many more people can afford cars, which has an impact on the consumption of fuel. The aviation segment has also grown. Currently we have 55 service stations operating in Zambia and we have nationwide coverage, and are present in all the provinces of Zambia from the south in Livingstone to Kasama in the north, and from Lundazi in the east to Senanga in the west. We are also in remote areas like Zambezi, where we established a new site last year. </p><h4>What are your expansion plans for 2016?</h4><p>Currently we have several sites that are undergoing renovations. This is a program that we have had in place for many years now. We are committed to revamping the old service stations and bringing them up to standard. We are also constructing new sites from scratch. All of this activity is designed to meet the market demand. Modern sites offer high quality services and additional facilities, like convenience stores, restaurants in the service stations, and so on, which we will be introducing soon in Zambia. Our investment in this country reflects our commitment to this market for the long term. </p><h4>Has this growth been reflected on PUMA Energy's performance at the LSE?</h4><p>I consider the Lusaka Stock Exchange to be dynamic. We observe new listings, which show that the stock exchange is advancing. If it was not, new companies would not be listed. The overall economy in Zambia is reflecting on the LSE. That is the reason why companies such as PUMA Energy are listed where the growth of the company should be viewed with a long-term perspective. </p><h4>How are you approaching the B2B segment?</h4><p>PUMA Energy Zambia is engaged in storage, distribution, sales, and marketing of fuels and lubricants to both the retail and B2B sectors. Puma Energy supplies fuels and lubricants to different segments of B2B from transport and agriculture to mining and parastatals. The mining sector is a key customer, but agriculture is also a key sector for the future. </p><h4>Are you involved in renewable energies in Zambia?</h4><p>We are not involved directly in this field, but we believe that they can assist to improve the energy mix. Renewable energies offer a huge opportunity for African countries to diversify their energy mix. We consider renewables key to the future of Zambia with its huge potential for solar and hydro-electricity.</p><h4>How does PUMA Energy integrate environmentally friendly policies into its operations?</h4><p>Firstly, it is Puma Energy's policy is to fully comply with the regulatory requirements of the countries where we operate in. Being in an industry dealing with hazardous products, health safety and environment (HSE) standards are of utmost importance to us. We have therefore put in place policies and practices that ensure we do not harm the environment. We have stringent specifications for the trucks that transport our product; our facilities are constructed to standards that exceed the local regulations; employees that work for Puma Energy are required to undergo refresher HSE training on an annual basis; and contractors that carry out works at Puma Energy facilities are vetted and trained to ensure they comply to the companies HSE standard. The company has an Environment Management System ISO 14001 certified by SGS who conducts annual surveillance audits to verify the company's continuous compliance. </p><h4>What is PUMA Energy's contribution in terms of job creation?</h4><p>We directly employ more than 200 people in Zambia with only two expatriates. Therefore, 98% of our staff is Zambian, meaning that PUMA Energy relies on local expertise to develop its affiliates. PUMA Energy is also contributing to job creation indirectly via our various contractors and retail sites. Also, the training component is vital for our development as a company and the development of this market. Training is implemented across the entire value chain, from senior managers, dealers, contractors, all the way to the staff at the service station. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our plan is to continue to contribute positively to the growth of the country. We expect to expand our operations and invest in new assets and infrastructure to build additional capacity in this market. We also aim to continue to deliver the highest quality of service to meet the expectations of our customers and shareholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are Trade Kings Group's main achievements since its establishment in 1992? </h4><p>Trade Kings started its operations in 1995 and has grown into several production entities to become The Trade Kings Group of companies managed and directed from a single point. The present companies now include the original Trade Kings Limited, Royal Oak Limited, Yoyol Foods Limited, Universal Mining and Chemical Industries Limited (UMCIL), Swiss Bake, and Trade Kings - South Africa. All of these companies stem from the original Trade Kings Limited. Trade Kings Limited began its operations with a single product—Boom detergent paste. From this one product we have diversified and now manufacture about 300 products. Three years ago we expanded into Harare, Zimbabwe with an investment of $50 million. There is also one production unit operating in Johannesburg, producing confectionery. As at now, the Trade Kings Group is the largest manufacturer of lollipops on the African continent. The company started with only 20 people, and in total today the group employs around 6,000. </p><h4>How much is being produced at the Trade Kings Group for export?</h4><p>All our 300 or products are produced for both the local and export markets. At the moment, we work at a 60% domestic, 40% export ratio. Our exports cover the entire SADC region, spanning the Great Lakes, Rwanda, Eastern Congo, parts of Tanzania, and Uganda and on the African continent the Group has a footprint in about 38 countries either directly or indirectly.</p><h4>How has the consumption of your products evolved in Zambia over recent years?</h4><p>Consumption has grown as we have made improvements to our product quality. We have also made extensive strides in improving our packaging. We have come to realize that there is a very large market that one company can never satisfy, namely a customer base of roughly 400 million people. And because there is enough of a market for numerous players, there is little perception of competition. </p><h4>How would you describe the quality of human resources in Zambia? </h4><p>Our experience is that Zambia has a high technical depth to the extent that virtually all types of technical requirements can be readily met with Zambian expertise. In fact you can find our people working in virtually every country in the region. The company opened with what could be called a silver spoon in its mouth since we benefitted  from the abundant, highly trained manpower that was made available by the results of privatization and the departure of the four multinationals that had hitherto dominated the fast moving household consumer goods manufacturing sector. These companies had abandoned what they saw as a non-performing Zambian economy and relocated in the neighboring countries. The company inherited scientists and other high-skilled personnel who had been trained abroad firstly by the departing multinational companies and equally by the former state enterprises who had their technical staff trained in Europe.</p><h4>With your experience in the Association of Manufacturers, what can the government do to further endorse Zambia's manufacturing industry?</h4><p>I believe that the government should have a closer dialogue with people working in the field to better grasp current and pressing issues. At times it seems that civil servants are prescribing solutions for problems that may not actually exist in the industry.</p><h4>How does the fluctuation of the kwacha have an impact on your operations?</h4><p>There are several causes for the fluctuation of the kwacha, one being irregular receipts from exports sales. This could potentially be addressed by boosting our exports. And meanwhile our lack of competitive edge in the international market due to the high cost of our products can be mitigated through greater investment within the country. The major problem from this situation is that it makes planning a bit harder since we have no control at what prices we buy our inputs.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We feel confident of improved returns on last year, and our expectations are logical, rather than radical. We are optimistic, and we will learn from last year in order to improve business all around.  Our sales figures have continued to grow and the only way to go is up. Firstly, we are confident the coming few years will be better than what we have had. Secondly, our expansion program, which includes the creation of new production centers in neighboring countries and our expansion into the Indian Ocean markets, will bolster our sales outreach.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Triblems evolved since being established in 2001?</h4><p>Triblems was initially a brainchild of my late relative Bright Lemana who died in a tragic road accident. He operated as a bookmaker servicing the Chamber of Mines and other local companies who needed invoice books or other materials. When I took over after his death we began to offer engineering solutions by engaging the respective users so as to help provide a solution that not only get the plant online in the shortest possible time, but one that would last. Since then we have provided the mining industry with one of the best heavy industrial steam cleaners and pressure washers available which are manufactured in the US by a company called Sioux corporation. We have factory-trained technicians who provide servicing for units at short notice. Battery Electric offered us the opportunity to service all their locomotive controllers, chargers, rectifiers, and LED energy efficient lights in Zambia.</p><h4>Why should a mining company select Triblems over the competition in Kitwe?</h4><p>We take time to understand the challenges of our clients before we supply any item. This makes our products most suitable and reliable to our clients.</p><h4>To what extent do the fluctuations in copper prices impact your operations?</h4><p>All aspects of life in the Copperbelt depend on the mines. When the mines are down, everyone is. The decline in the international price of copper always has a spillover affect. The Copperbelt as a whole suffers because the mines purchase fewer spares and are not producing at full capacity. In order to cope with those problems we are seeking to diversify. We are evaluating the development of new business not only with private entities but also with the government. </p><h4>What are your investment plans for the near future?</h4><p>We are working to build a high-capacity workshop with an investment of ZMK3.7 million. This new development will change the face of the company. Our product portfolio will grow and our services will become more specialized.</p><h4>What type of partnerships are you considering for your future ventures?</h4><p>Last February, we partnered with a company specialized in underground drilling. We will be attending training sessions to increase our knowhow in that type of drilling. We have also partnered with John Thompson a member of the Actom group to service the country in the requirement of boilers and associated accessories.</p><h4>How would you describe the quality of the human resources available to you? </h4><p>We are planning to rely on our own staff, to train them and make them reliable, as whatever they repair has to be repaired perfectly. We have around 10 technicians working for us.</p><h4>What are you regional expansion plans?</h4><p>We are trying to expand to Kasama, Luanshya, as well as the DRC.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in Zambia for establishing a company? </h4><p>It is a positive environment, but I believe that the government has to look at ways to make it cheaper to operate, especially for the locals. The emphasis should also be placed on supporting locals in partnering with international companies. Besides that, the government should introduce laws to actually protect local companies.</p><h4>What role can Triblems play in the social and economic development of Kitwe? </h4><p>We believe that we could expand and further support the industry if we received government support. That will help us employ more people and, therefore, contribute more to employment and wealth creation. We want to employ many more people, particularly new graduates. We are looking at tripling the number of employees once our new workshop is complete and operational.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our expectations are on the light side, we want to wait and see that our building materializes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Zambia's competitiveness evolved in the past year?</h4><p>Zambia started addressing important issues related to its regional competitiveness in 2003. At that time, the country had to engage the World Bank and the IMF regarding leakages in the economy. Both organizations were of the view that our investor-related legislation required urgent tightening. Zambian Export Processing Zones Authority (ZEPZA) the Zambia Investment Centre  were not conducive to effective Trade and Investment, which allowed for the above mentioned leakages. As a result, the Zambian government, together with the World Bank and the IMF, agreed on the Private Sector Development Program. The program featured eight or nine action points, which led to certain reforms being carried out. One of these called for the merging of the five promotional agencies within the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, and Industry to create what today is the Zambian Development Agency. The five institutions merged were the Investment Center, the Export Board of Zambia, the Small Enterprise Development Board, the Zambian Privatization Agency, and the Zambian Export Processing Zones Authority. The need for the reduction of the cost of doing business took center stage as well. Major legislative reforms were carried out. Additionally, fees and levies had to be addressed in order to reduce the cost of doing business. Therefore, while the business community had been facing unpredictable fees, today effective regulation is in place. To date, we are talking about the Business Regulatory Review Agency (BRRA), which ensures that no new levies or taxes are put in place unless justified.</p><h4>How would you describe the evolution of the Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZs) and their role in achieving the three objectives of the Triangle of Hope?</h4><p>Around 2005 to 2006, we started looking at the “Triangle of Hope," and within that began seriously looking at issues of infrastructure development. Most would-be developers are reluctant to enter Africa on account of inadequate infrastructure. Therefore, we set about improving infrastructure to international standards. We started with the Lusaka South Multi-Facility Economic Zone by coming up with a master plan where we deliberately indicated that we would meet international standards in the provision of roads, water sanitation, power, and ICT as well as solid waste management. We wanted world-class energy provision where we supply power from three power sources, such that if one power source went down, there would be no interruption of supply. We had to factor in enhanced ICT provision to international levels. This does not discount what the private sector itself is doing. In 2006, the then-president of China Hu Jintao read out eight measures to a summit for Sino-African cooperation commonly called Forum on China/Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), one of which was a measure regarding the development of multi-facility economic zones in five countries, with Zambia selected as the pilot country. As a result of that, we now have multi-facility economic zones in the Copperbelt and Lusaka East. In the two zones promoted by the Chinese government, around 48 enterprises have already been established. They are already in a position to realize exports worth up to about $500 million. Moreover, they have created close to 8,000 jobs for Zambians on a total investment of $1.4 billion. In terms of infrastructure established at the zone, $177 million had been dedicated to a 20km stretch of road in Chambishi MFEZ. Of course, power supply is already in place, and hence, the infrastructure there is already highly competitive and second to none in the world. Businesses should certainly take advantage of the infrastructure available in these multi-facility economic zones. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main characteristics of the LS-MFEZ?</h4><p>LS-MFEZ was declared in 2010 by the Government of the Republic of Zambia through the Ministry of Commerce, Trade, and Industry. The purpose of setting up the Zone is to promote manufacturing, especially export-oriented activities, technological development, skills transfer, jobs, and wealth creation. LS-MFEZ is intended to act as a catalyst for industrialization in Zambia, as the country is heavily reliant on its copper resources. Around 70-80% of Zambian exports are copper. When there are shocks in the price of copper on the world market, the economy suffers. The Government has, therefore, prioritized the development of multi-facility economic zones (MFEZs) as a way of diversifying the Zambian economy. At the moment there are a couple of MFEZs, with LS-MFEZ being the only one run by the Government. LS MFEZ Ltd started operations in January, 2013 and the response from investors and the public has been overwhelming. The zone is neighbored with the Lusaka Game Park and those interested in wildlife and natural fauna can also visit the local game park, which was opened in June 2015 by the President of the Republic of Zambia. LS-MFEZ is a mixed-use development comprising industrial, commercial, and residential developments, but the core business is the industrial part. The Zone expects about 400 companies set up base in the zone when it is fully developed, in different sectors such as agro-processing, electronics, gemstone processing, pharmaceuticals, and ICT. The LS-MFEZ has a total area of 2,100 hectares in a rectangular configuration measuring seven kilometers by three-kilometers. In terms of land use, 20% of the zone is for general industrial use. The rest is demarcated for commercial, residential, common facilities, and high-technology zones. </p><h4>How many companies are operating at present from the LS-MFEZ?</h4><p>In terms of investor applications, so far there are over 130 expressions of interest, out of which 16 companies have been approved to start construction activities by the Board. Some of these companies have already started construction and should start commercial production by the end of 2015. </p><h4>How much is the investment you have made in LS-MFEZ?</h4><p>In terms of the infrastructure and utility services, about  $40 million has been spent to date. However, over $400 million is required to fully develop infrastructure in the Zone.</p><h4>Which countries are showing the most interest in coming to LS-MFEZ?</h4><p>The zone is open to both local and foreign investors, but so far we have had strong interest from Indian and Chinese companies.</p><h4>What are the incentives for investors to operate here?</h4><p>LS-MFEZ is a special economic zone. There is a zero rated tax exemption on income tax and custom duty for five years for investors. This is a plus for people wishing to invest, because they will enjoy those tax incentives alongside the infrastructure and utility services being provided within the zone.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of investing here rather than in neighboring countries?</h4><p>If you are investing in Zambia, you have a comparative advantage, because there are eight countries bordering the Zambia. The local and regional market is huge. The Zambian government has been improving infrastructure over the past few years to boost local and regional trade with countries like the DRC, Angola, and Mozambique.</p><h4>What impact will the industrial zone have on the socio-economic development of the country? </h4><p>The LS-MFEZ  will be one of the key economic drivers of for Zambia's economy in future. It will create 100,000 jobs for Zambians when fully developed, which will have a huge impact on job creation.</p><h4>How would you describe the business environment in the country?</h4><p>Zambia is one of the best countries in which to invest because the economy is liberalized and there are numerous tax incentives for those investing in multi-facility economic zones, industrial parks, and rural areas. The weather is good and the people are friendly, which makes for a great environment for doing business.</p><h4>What sectors will have the most potential in the industrial zone?</h4><p>All sectors in the Zone have great potential for development. Such sectors include agro-processing, electronics, ICT, education, and skills training. The high-tech zone also offers great potential for the future. Don't forget also the commercial sector with new shopping malls, conference centers, hotels, and similar developments, plus the residential sector. The residential sector will require about 30,000 housing units to be constructed within the zone. These are interesting sectors for investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

</h4><p>
	My mandate was to industrialize ZCCM and increase its value. ZCCM has historically been highly involved in the mining industry, and we are now in the process of industrialization. We are investing in energy on a 300 MW power plant, and moving toward micro hydro stations. We are also interested in adding value to copper, and are in the process of conceptualizing a factory to manufacture copper wires and cables. This project will commence within 18 months at a cost of around $65 million. We will also commence work on manganese mining. We are targeting processes such as manganese oxide production, which will double the value of the raw manganese. In addition, we are funding a Zambian exploration company exploring for manganese in Luapula province. Our other venture is investment in property.  When privatization occurred assets were issued to residents and companies as a form of payment. Certain assets were forgotten, and upon discovering that we have a number of properties, we decided to capitalize on them, by upgrading and renting them out.
</p><h4>
	In addition to mining and real estate, what other sectors are you involved in?
</h4><p>
	We are getting involved in cement manufacturing at our Ndola Lime plant. Cement is a very expensive commodity in Zambia, which makes major projects, including road building, expensive. Our intention is to see a reduction in prices as a result of the opening of new plants. Within 18 months we plan to open one with a daily capacity of 5,000 tons. There is much that needs to be done to industrialize the country, which cannot be done without the basic component of cement.
</p><h4>
	What are the main factors behind your positive performance at the stock exchange?
</h4><p>
	The market has confidence in ZCCM; we have seen a 163% increase in market share. We are also the best performing company on the Lusaka Stock Exchange. The trick in any investment company is to manage your diversification because singular commodities can be paralyzing. Our strategy is to industrialize Zambia. We are monitoring our investments closely, looking at new businesses and analyzing their potential risks and returns.
</p><h4>
	Given the drop in copper prices and increase in mining royalties, how confident is ZCCM of positive sector evolution?
</h4><p>
	We are positive, not least as the president has a clear vision for growth of the Zambian economy and is keen on trickle down economics. There will be more people employed and generating income, as jobs are being generated from the top down. ZCCM-IH will employ hundreds of people in our copper plants and concrete plants. Though the price of copper has been decreasing, we are now seeing an upswing in the market. Higher taxes will affect us because we receive dividends from the mines, although I should stress that it is necessary to pay equitable taxes. Mining companies need to be transparent in their dealings. Taxes may appear unpalatable, but are ultimately directed to raise funds to the betterment of society. In October 2014 we declared a dividend of $40 million to our shareholders.
</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>
	The sky is the limit for ZCCM because we have government support to grow the company. The major shareholders in the government want us to move forward, and I have an excellent team to support me. Our projects are adding value to the company and making money for the shareholders. Although the next few years will be challenging for our team, in the long run we will reap the rewards. Within two years we should add close to $500 million to our assets.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The insurance industry in Zambia is competitive, with over 25 companies currently operating. How would you describe the business landscape for companies, and is there the potential for consolidation?</h4><p>The insurance industry has seen significant growth in terms of the number of companies and those with licenses. There is an increased interest in the industry, and there are many applications currently being processed for new insurance businesses. Generally, the economy has been doing well, and so amid rising GDP a number of businesses have felt the nation's potential across various sectors. With a growing economy, there needs to be proper insurance infrastructure to support business. Among aspects precipitating growth are our low capitalization requirements, which have made it easier for players to enter the market. Consequently, we anticipate the government issuing new guidelines and standards for these new entities, as strong entities provide greater security for their policyholders. When the statutory requirements for capital are issued by the ministry we will likely see consolidation and companies listing on the capital market. There is already interest from insurance companies to be listed, and we anticipate companies injecting more money to reach their required capital levels. As a result, we anticipate more protection for policyholders, which would be good for the industry and economy alike</p><h4>Do you see predominately international or domestic interest?</h4><p>We see international interest, but there are also local players wanting to enter the market. The challenge lies in accessing finance, but the interest is there. </p><h4>What steps is the PIA taking to increase insurance penetration, which remains at 3%?</h4><p>Last year, one of our strategies was related to micro insurance, while the other was related to financial literacy and education. In order to encourage people to take up insurance and appreciate the need for it, especially in areas such as agriculture, tourism, and SMEs, we are engaged in a wide range of activities. We expect to see increasing insurance uptake and subsequent rising penetration levels.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in broadening the insurance market?</h4><p>Technology provides a platform for insurance to be made accessible to quite a number of people. We need more innovation, especially for technology to extend our reach; this is one area we are trying to properly regulate as an authority. Providing a product is one thing, but in terms of regulation, we want to ensure that subscribers are getting their claims paid. </p><h4>What are the specific steps that should be taken to improve access?</h4><p>This is one of the hindering areas in need of improvement. If there is a tax on insurance, the policy becomes less affordable to the man on the street. The government needs to alleviate the tax on certain types of insurance in order to increase access, especially in terms of micro insurance. This is the area through which we are trying to reach the mass market, and we trust that the government will adopt a favorable position and eliminate the tax. </p><h4>Are there other ways to encourage and incentivize micro insurance?</h4><p>Insurance companies, as business entities, can become more innovative by embedding micro insurance into areas surrounding the product, especially with life insurance or investment. We can expect the rules and provisions to become less stringent to ease access for those making claims. </p><h4>Considering that non-life insurance makes up the bulk of business, what is the opportunity for life insurance segment growth?</h4><p>Over the years, we have seen life insurance grow, and a number of life insurance companies are on the rise. Through insurance education, more people are developing an appreciation of this segment. Many of the issues regarding life insurance have something to do with cultural backgrounds, and so there is a need to start there and break down some preconceived ideas. Slowly people are beginning to understand the value of this type of insurance.</p><h4>What role does takaful insurance play in the PIA?</h4><p>We have taken takaful on as a new product for the market. In terms of principles, it is like any traditional insurance in terms of payments. The real interest comes from the Islamic community; that said; non-Muslims have participated as well. PIA's aim to is capture what is happening in the economy. We need to enhance financial inclusion, which will give us more options to offer those seeking insurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>LuSE is involved in a process of demutualization. What do you hope to achieve?</h4><p>During my first 12 months as the CEO of LuSE, we focused on accelerating some pending issues. A big part of our strategy is demutualization, a process that was started a year or two ago but the actual work of the Consultant started in October 2013. We completed the first phase with the submission of a report to the Demutualisation Steering Committee in November 2014 and the subsequent presentation by this independent committee to the LuSE Board and its members. The members' unanimous resolutions to demutualize and the associated changes to the Articles of Association were submitted to the SEC and we await their approval. This presents a fantastic opportunity for new investors to invest into the LuSE. The London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange are demutualized exchanges. On the continent, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and the Nairobi Stock Exchange already went through the process and are both listed on themselves. The Nairobi Stock Exchange had an order book in the region of $56 million when they were seeking to raise $9 million. This shows the bullish demand for exchange stock. Though our method may be different, part of the reason for this process is to raise funds for our various strategies for growth. We are due for upgrades to our systems for example. Retooling our exchange will require a significant financial investment. </p><h4>What sectors have you found the most bullish in the last year?</h4><p>The LuSE has two markets: equities, and bond or debt. In the debt market, the financial services market has been the most active. We have had micro-finance companies raise capital through bonds. Currently, we only have one company listed in the energy sector, Copperbelt Energy Corporation, which raised the equivalent of about $70 million, to finance some of its expansion activities within Zambia and the continent which means the sector is thriving. Manufacturing and construction are interesting sectors as the country seeks to expand its economy. Lafarge opened the year with a share price of ZMK15-17, and now shares have risen to ZMK26. In the investments category, ZCCM-IH, a mining investments company, owns a stake in most mining companies in Zambia. ZCCM-IH conducted the largest rights offer in the history of the exchange, allowing it to expunge about $400 million worth of debt from its balance sheets. We are also excited about telecommunications. There are three operators, and Airtel, the only one currently listed, wants to offer more shares. We expect MTN and Zamtel, which is state-owned, will be listed on the exchange in due course. </p><h4>LuSE recently created an alternative market for SMEs. How will this market help them? </h4><p>The Zambian economy is mostly comprised of SMEs. We look at SMEs as an engine for growth. Zambeef is a great example of a company that started off as an SME 20-25 years ago, and is now a real economic contributor. We are establishing an alternative market to separate listings between the main board and the alternative market. This will allow smaller companies to access increased funding. SMEs are underfunded because the financial sector has been structured to favor large companies. Through the alternative market, we have not only made access easier through lower requirements and fees, we have also created a support structure for new companies. The alternative market, from the advisory perspective, is structured to allow for the mentoring of the SMEs. At the same time, we still have strict requirements regarding corporate structuring and practices.  Therefore this market is a low requirements market but still maintains the high standards expected of any exchange.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Zanaco progressed toward the goal one million customers by 2015?</h4><p>At the end of 2014, our customer base was at about 850,000 when we published the numbers. Despite 2014 being a difficult year for us, we still saw an increase in customer base from the previous year. Reaching 1 million customers is still an attainable objective that was refreshed earlier in 2015 with our management team. </p><h4>How has the mining tax increase from 6% to 20% impacted the banking and finance markets?</h4><p>The tax increase is putting additional costs on the mining industry, and at the moment they are faced with two issues. One is that the world demand for copper and the price for copper are down, and now with the tax regime change they are getting hit twice. International companies run their businesses in a way that takes into account global factors, and that is not always linked to the development of a specific country. They have shareholders and must make a return on their investment. Zanaco however is a Zambian bank, and our roots are here. We have to live, work, and survive commercially in this environment. </p><h4>How would you describe your current market within Zambia's concentrated banking system?</h4><p>This is a competitive market but with high concentration. Effectively, there are four or five banks that control 60% of the market. In a way we are overbanked in the number of players, which is a challenge for the players to be profitable and sustainable. One distinction about the Zambian banking market is that there is large number of unbanked potential customers. We are trying to grow the sector, by reaching out to the unbanked. We are focused on important segments such as agricultural and SMEs as well as retail, corporate and the government sectors. It is about being focused on what you do and doing it well. </p><h4>How would you describe Zambia's mobile banking adoption?</h4><p>The penetration of phones is increasing everyday, and it amazes me how much more access even remote areas have. The one thing most people strive to have is a phone, and the price of the technology is decreasing. The most basic banking processes can run even on the cheapest of phones. As we reach out to the more remote areas, we need to provide the fundamentals and security to people to encourage them to bank in their own environment. </p><h4>How does Zanaco facilitate credit to SMEs?</h4><p>Entrepreneurs are still struggling to find finances, and this is where we as bank and a sector need to do more. Since entrepreneurs do not have many assets or collateral, giving credit is an investment in the person and their activities, and how successful you think they will be moving forward. Now though, we are seeing more and more businesses that started from nothing but have gained a solid base and even international reputations. </p><h4>How would you describe the business environment, and how does Zanaco make Zambia a more attractive investment destination?</h4><p>Investors are looking at the stability of a country as well as commercial opportunity before investing. It is important for investors to find a safe environment for workers, in which government policies are clear and processes are supportive for investments. Providing an enabling environment is something that Zambia does very well; this country gives opportunities for successful business ventures. The role of a bank like Zanaco is to lend capital and support to people making investments in Zambia. We can help provide successful outcomes because we have been here for a long time, we know how the marketplace works, and we have an extensive network to share—we can help in providing the financial assistance to help build a successful outcome.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We anticipate this being a challenging year, with many of last year's same characteristics present at the macro level. Profitability will be challenging in the short-term, but in the long-term we see a more solid picture. Next year will be an election year for Zambia, so 2016 may be a bit of a wild card with its own set of circumstances. However, over the next three to five years we have positive outlook. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has production capacity evolved in Zambia over the past year? </h4><p>Kansanshi, the largest copper mine in Africa, continues to operate efficiently. Sentinel is being commissioned and produced its first concentrate on December 31, 2014, which was ten years to the day since Kansanshi started producing its first concentrate. Commissioning will be complete in 3Q2015, depending on completion of the electricity line that we have constructed between Kalumbila and Lusaka West. Once that is online we will be able run both trains at Sentinel concurrently. Sentinel is an incredible mine and is all about scale. </p><h4>What makes Sentinel such an efficient, state-of-the-art mine?</h4><p>It is located in one of the most remote parts of Zambia, which is a landlocked country. Approximately 14,500 trucks of material were required to build the mine, and it has the biggest mills that you will see in operation anywhere in the world. You have to go to Chile to find mills of similar size. We have also striven to build a sustainable community to support the mine, which is one of the aspects of the project that makes it unique. This will also make it sustainable beyond the life of the mine. We have been meticulous in building the infrastructure to underpin the community as it grows and this includes affordable housing for employees along with schools and clinics. We are attracting businesses from around the world to set up there, and have become the major employer within the region, and are set to become a major contributor to the Zambian treasury through tax receipts when we enter commercial operations. Investment in the project so far, which includes the Enterprise nickel mine, stands at $2.1 billion.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the government's decision regarding mining taxes?</h4><p>We look for a competitive and stable tax regime in every jurisdiction in which we operate. We understand the politics of Zambia and applaud the President's courage in stepping back from 20% MRT, but to split open-pit and underground mines as if open-pit were low cost and underground high does not accurately describe challenges within the sector, as 9% MRT, 30% corporate tax, and 15% variable profit tax is extremely high. In fact, Zambia remains the highest base metal tax jurisdiction in the world, so we would like to see further movement in this area and we are engaging the government constantly through the Chamber of Mines to try and make Zambia a more competitive tax jurisdiction for investors. The DRC, for example, has had the same tax regime since 2002 and has a mineral royalty of 2.5%. We think there is still work to do and that negotiations and discussions need to continue with the government, with whom our relationship remains close.</p><h4>How do these issues affect Kansanshi's status as one of the most competitive mines in the world?</h4><p>With the Kansanshi smelter commissioning progressing so well, we are now producing a significant amount of sulphuric acid which is clearly of great benefit. We remain one of the most efficient, low-cost mines in Africa. Any challenging fiscal situation then makes you take the time to examine your efficiencies with a great deal of scrutiny and then forces you to leverage those efficiencies.  The electrical assists on our mining fleet are enabling us to greatly increase productivity in terms of the daily amount of ore that we can produce. </p><h4>How would you describe the current infrastructure in Zambia for the development of a healthy mining industry?</h4><p>Zambian infrastructure is improving all the time. The government has invested heavily in road infrastructure. We read a lot about aspirations to improve the railways, and we are supportive of this. An improved rail system in Zambia would benefit the country significantly—remember, Zambia is land-locked. In terms of electricity, we are building over 60km of power lines in partnership with Zesco. Initially this has connected Kansanshi through Lumwana to Kalumbila and provides sufficient power to run the first train at Sentinel. Once the second, longer power line of 545km, is complete running from Lusaka West to Kalumbila, it will complete a ring around Zambia. This will help to flatten out unhelpful power spikes. In any industrial context it will also improve reliability and benefit the country as a whole through rural electrification opportunities in areas where there would be no other means of accessing power. These are all pluses, and we expect that line to be complete within the next few weeks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What landmarks and achievements have characterized EBRD's role in Kazakhstan over the past 20 years?</h4><p>EBRD is the largest foreign investor outside of the oil and gas sector, with investments in the country now exceeding $7.2 billion. Last year marked a landmark in our relationship, as we signed the Enhanced Partnership Arrangement with the Kazakhstani government. As did major international financial institutions. The Kazakhstani government allocated almost $2.7 billion for co-financing along with EBRD and other international financial institutions. EBRD expects in excess of $1 billion in investments this year, and as of the end of August, we have already seen more than $600 million. Active projects we are working on include agribusiness, manufacturing, industry, minerals and mining, oil and gas, pharmaceutical sectors, financial institutions and SMEs as well as municipal infrastructure. We have also spread across Kazakhstan, and we are now working actively in nine regions. We currently have offices in five cities outside of Almaty and Astana, and plan to open in Karaganda in the last quarter of the year. In addition to traditional EBRD-type banking type activities, where we either take debt or equity, we also have our SBS, or Small Business Services (previously called the BAS Program), that is now all but fully funded by the Kazakhstani government. We have $30 million as a part of the enhanced partnership program for five years, which currently helps fund roughly 25 people who work throughout Kazakhstan, providing consulting services to SMEs, including anything from balance sheet structuring to marketing plans, etc. As part of this program in September we launched the $41 million Women In Business Program, which will provide funding and advisory services to over 2000 Women lead enterprises. <br>EBRD has been active in policy dialogue with the Kazakhstani government. We are focusing on Energy Efficiency and Green Economy Astana International Financial System and Financial Sector Reform, and PPP development .Wee worked with IFC in coordination with the Kazakhstani government on the first PPP, which was the successfully tendered ring road around Almaty.</p><h4>What's the value of this and other major PPP projects?</h4><p>It is valued at approximately $700 million to $1 billion. It is a landmark project that will pave the way other projects such as healthcare PPPs. We participated in meetings with the Ministry of Health and the Government, and we hope to launch the first large healthcare PPP early next year in Almaty. We also put in place a landmark $200-million project to finance SMEs through banks in Kazakhstan. An important part of that project is helping to train risk-management teams in the banks that we work with so that we do not end up with new non-performing loans. We are also working closely with the National Bank on Astana International Financial Center project. We see this is a key driver of reforms in the country. What is unusual about Astana International Financial Center is that will be one of the only two such centers in the world where the language used will not be the native language of the country—it will be English, like in Dubai. It will also have English legal system. Parliament is expected to approve the first steps necessary to amend the constitution to allow this. There are so many different laws and constitutional changes; it is an exciting and innovative move.</p><h4>There is clearly a lot going on, with 182 projects to date in Kazakhstan. Why is Kazakhstan such an appealing market for your shareholders?</h4><p>Right now, this country is an appealing market because of the evidence of the reform movement and the drive for reform. In almost all sectors there is unprecedented change. You have the new investment legislation that is coming, coupled with the new money market and industry regime as well as the taxation code. Second, there are few places in the world where there is still a positive GDP right now, and we are still predicting 1.5% GDP growth even after the devaluation. One of the key areas is logistics and transport. Whenever I speak to foreign investors, people always ask me what are the key areas to invest in, and I would say anything related to transport, logistics, and construction materials. Kazakhstan is in close proximity to China and Russia, and Iran is about to open up. The sheer size of the country and the fact that so much of the infrastructure has been inadequate and untouched for so long offer significant opportunities for those looking at investing in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>What potential do you see in developing the country's infrastructure?</h4><p>Infrastructure is absolutely critical both for Kazakhstan and trade between China and Western Europe. There are 135 million people living in the area of China next to Kazakhstan, and there is a government policy in China to move more of the population westward. If you look at the markets for Kazakhstani products, interestingly enough, Kazakhstan is the number one producer of wheat flour. And if you look at the direction they are exporting, it is to places like Uzbekistan, Central Asia, northern Iran and western China. There are 21 airports in Kazakhstan, and many of them need infrastructural developments. Investments are needed across seaports on the Caspian, the rail network, and the air. We are also investing in Astana airport, developing a runway project for the new airport terminal for 2020. Regarding municipal infrastructure, we are involved in nine Oblasts. In Kyzlorda we are working with the Akimat on a complete municipal framework including district heating, waste management, water treatment, street lighting, and municipal transport. In Almaty, you can see the results of what we have completed, including 400 CNG buses and 200 trolley buses. Environmentally friendly modern transport is absolutely critical and makes a real difference in the daily lives of people.</p><h4>What sectors of the Kazakhstani economy are showing most promise to EBRD?</h4><p>We had been doing little in the agribusiness sector until this year, and it was the theme of the foreign investors' council meeting, which was held in June between the President of Kazakhstan and EBRD's president Sir Suma Chakrabarti. We have made several investments in agribusiness, including the edible oils area. We are also looking at poultry as well as food retail and processing. We recently allocated a $50 million loan to RG Brands, one of the key local agribusiness producers. We were able to lend them in tenge, which helps them to continue their growth and expansion in the sector.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We expect that the economy will grow by more than 2%, and that EBRD will funnel close to $1 billion. While most of our investments are in the private sector, we work very closely with the Government, and the National Bank of Kazakhstan. We see that there is a wealth of activity and opportunity here for us. One of the key things is that most of our team in Kazakhstan are locals, and we are a small handful of expats. It is important to have such a talent based in Kazakhstan. We have people working with us who have graduated from the best universities in the world, and this enables us to operate successfully in the country. We really feel that in Kazakhstan we are partners with the government.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[We Got Back Up]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[we-got-back-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the competitive landscape in Zambia?</h4><p>The only challenge we have on that front is the fact that the minimum capital requirement of entering the sector remains quite low, at ZMW1 million, which is roughly $150,000 or less at the current exchange rate. In terms of competition, we have relied on quality service delivery and product innovation to ensure our long-term survival. We have also put in place  a clearly defined financial strategy. That has been our focus, and has allowed us to distinguish ourselves from our competition; the point being that prompt claims settlement is our main priority. Let me add that we are the only insurance company in the market to have introduced the “on the spot claims settlement" campaign for five claims categories, provided documentation is available. These are usually claims for things like car windscreens, batteries, radios, and tires, houses, household goods, laptops, or other electronic devices. We believe that such possessions do not merit a lengthy process, and that in all these cases, people require an urgent solution.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the new insurance act?</h4><p>In terms of the new act, I would mention three progressive components that contrast with the current landscape. The first is the fact that, for the first time, micro insurance will be subject to specific regulation. Even as we are developing new products in the micro insurance segment, we are doing so with the assistance and guidance of the Pensions and Insurance Authority. Secondly, the new act will help in terms strengthening corporate  governance in insurance companies. As an example, the new act has stipulated a minimum of seven board members per entity. The third aspect relates to shareholding structure. Thus far, we have had no guidelines in terms of, for example, the stake that a foreign entity can own when establishing an insurance company in Zambia. Once the new act is in place, foreign entities will only be able to have a maximum of 70% stake, while the remaining 30% is to be held by Zambian nationals. I consider this to be progressive in the sense that Zambians will continue to participate actively in the development of the insurance sector as we have capacity to do so.</p><h4>What could the government do to further develop the insurance sector in Zambia?</h4><p>In my view, one of the major steps the government could take is assist us in terms of reducing the cost of insurance. At the moment, I feel that the cost remains prohibitively high due to the 16% VAT added to each policy. I believe that if VAT were removed, as was the case before, it would go a long way in terms of incentivizing people to buy insurance. Other than that, I feel the government could also help in terms of more strictly regulating the issue of premium finance. We do not have a good mechanism to ensure that those who buy insurance actually end up paying for it; currently, considerable sums are being written off as bad debt. I have seen this happen in other countries where the government addresses the matter through  the introduction of the “cash and carry" policy with regard to insurance premiums.  </p><h4>What role does insurance play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>The benefits of insurance are immense. When you start a business, the shareholders invest considerably to get the ball rolling. The last thing we want to see is a flood, fire or other calamity laying this effort to waste. In that sense, the insurance industry plays a key role in ensuring  business  continuity and peace of mind. Secondly, insurance helps the broader economy by inculcating a culture of savings. As insurance companies, we invest much of the revenues generated from premiums into a number of financial  instruments, such as fixed deposits, treasury bills, and so on. This money goes a long way in terms of  helping with the development process, both directly and indirectly. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What needs in the market are you fulfilling that were previously unattended?</h4><p>We have partnered with government, prime private sector companies, and SMEs. The company is headed towards attaining one million customers. We recently launched micro-lending to civil servants that enables them to access the facility within a processing timeframe of 24 hours. This is the first phase in our business plan followed by the private sector in the second phase.</p><h4>How can you make a successful business from clients considered high risk?</h4><p>This segment can be advantageous as an opportunity to make money and give people the chance to realize their ambitions. Competitive advantage lies in creating an opportunity from a threat the potential clients considered high risk. This advantage can be realized by introduction of structured financial solutions that are strategically customized for these clients to mitigate potential risk. </p><h4>What role do financial services play in the socioeconomic development of the country?</h4><p>Individuals and businesses need to be able to manage their finances in order to make changes in their lives or activities. The financial sector is critical to the market and the economy, because that is what drives enterprises and allows people to move up to the next level. We need to send a message to the government and remind them that financial institutions are the core of the economy.</p><h4>What kind of changes in regulations are we likely to see in the financial sector? </h4><p>Regulations related to interest rates will be crucial. The factors that contribute to the interest rates are related to political developments. It should be noted that Zambia is a safe destination for any investor, but on the other hand we have investors coming in that are high risk, so interest has to be high. If you borrow money at high rates you cannot make repayments.</p><h4>What steps need to be taken for Zambia to improve its manufacturing industry?</h4><p>The government is the key player in the economy, and must take the initiative to diversify industry. The industrial sectors of Germany, the US, and the UK, as well as other major economies, are all strong. With the backing of the agricultural sector, you need not worry about currency fluctuation, which is why our government needs to put most of its focus on bringing out the best in both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. As a financial institution we need to support the government and must make it simpler for people to access money and support their businesses.</p><h4>Is the government sufficiently protective of local industry?</h4><p>Zambian local manufacturing industry competes with continental and global imports. However, the country has witnessed potential growth and this could be improved by revisiting the Procurement and Manufacturing Act. This would regulate factors of protection, support and give more incentives to local businesses and encourage emergence of more local manufacturer. </p><h4>How to you plan to help improve financial literacy?</h4><p>We are in discussions with partners from various institutions, and are aiming to start some new programs in this area. We are in communication with the Lusaka Stock Exchange, and want to develop workshops for the general public. The public sector will undertake the education of citizens in the importance of sensibly investing borrowed money to better control their savings. We are hoping to start this program in September.</p><h4>Is JMAAC partnering with ICT companies to improve the access to financial services through the use of technology?</h4><p>We are working on an application with which you can access money on your mobile phone, and are partnering mobile companies for this scheme. We expect the project to be operational in August 2015. There is an IT company set to provide this service, and we are merely waiting to sign on the dotted line. We would like to develop mobile facilities in rural areas, and will promote these nationwide beginning in Lusaka province. We hope to expand the facility rapidly. By December I would like to be supporting at least 20 manufacturing companies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key priorities that you keep in mind to successfully achieve Vision 2030?</h4><p>When you are a developing country, almost everything is a priority, as everything needs to be properly integrated. You have to stimulate and grow the economy by promoting sectors such as agriculture and the power sector. It is impossible to fully develop the economy in the absence of infrastructure so you have to give almost equal weight to all areas of this development to make sure there is progress. You have to give weight to education, as the only way that nations can increase their productive capacity through their people. You also have to give equal attention to health as the productivity of the population affects the overall growth of the economy. The issue of priority has got to be put in the proper context as you have to give weight to all these departments and imperatives of development to move the economy forward.</p><h4>The informal economy is still significant in Zambia. What incentives are provided for entrepreneurs to move into the formal economy?</h4><p>The government engages with various institutions that support this and that can extend lending to these enterprises. Taxation within the informal sector can be a problematic issue because the cost of collecting taxes from this sector may exceed the net contribution. Every system must have internal logic and any tax measure must bring in more revenue than it costs to administer. The informal sector taxation should not choke the enterprise sector. We need to find ways to provide extended logistical support to these enterprising people and that way everyone will make a contribution to taxes. If they do not pay taxes directly through making taxable income then they buy products and services and pay VAT, so in one way or another contribution will collectively be made. Further, transport costs will return indirectly to the economy as taxes will be levied on fuel. It does not always make sense to chase the entrepreneurs to make taxable contributions until the balance tips in favor of this taxation being profitable for the economy at the end of the day.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead in terms of GDP and inflation?</h4><p>Inflation for the past ten years has been kept in single figures and we expect this to continue. In general, Zambia is quite a high-cost country and the interest rate levels in the banking system are high, so it is our intention that these will come down. That is the reason why our external borrowing is increasing. We are avoiding borrowing locally as this would only push interest rates up. As a short- to medium-term measure, the government will reduce the budget deficit as part of the plan to moderate interest rates. When we presented the budget for this year, our expectation for the economy was GDP growth of 7%. However, there have been adverse movements in the global economy, such as the downward trend in commodity prices. This has inclined us to revise the GDP growth for this year to 5.8%. I am not sure we will be able to meet this expectation given the energy challenges we are experiencing following the revision. We thus expect GDP growth this year to slow down to around 5.5%, a rate that is still above the average economic growth in Sub Saharan Africa, which is around 4%. We need to encourage business in the industrial sector, and improve sectors like agriculture and agro processing. We also need to deal with the power challenge through diversification initiatives into areas such as solar power. This is an exciting prospect for the economy. We need to grow the economy in these areas, maintain sustainably high levels of growth, and rise above the current difficulties of depressed primary commodities and weather-induced energy shortages. In terms of commodities, products such as soya beans and coffee remain at quite high prices, and we need to continue encouraging growth in those areas as they will stabilize our foreign exchange earnings.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you expect your client number to evolve in the near future?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Stella Sata</strong> With financial literacy increasing in Zambia and a growing number of mobile users, we will be able to reach more people through the mobile app. Our client base is already growing, and we only advertise on social media. </p><p><span></span><strong>Simba Rukayi </strong>Basically, the whole essence of the mobile app is to allow for a system where people can gain a respectable level of financial knowledge without even being in touch with us. It is a financial planning mobile app that helps businesses make an informed decision.  The application helps people running businesses to consider the variables and gain knowledge of their finances to gain a better understanding of how their businesses operate. The application is available on Android phones at the moment since access is spreading in most areas through that operating system, however we plan on rolling it out to apple store and release added products once we find an investor to help us financially . We want the application to be usable offline as well. </p><h4>What role will this app and your company play in the social and economic development of the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>SS</strong> Increasing financial literacy is key for development because the more people who understand business, the more sustainable businesses will be. That means small businesses will grow to medium-sized business, and more jobs will be created. Competition within the market will grow, which will increase efficiency of delivery of services. Also, people who are financially literate are more likely to pay taxes and stay visible in the market. </p><h4>How would you characterize Zambia's progress in terms of ICT adoption?</h4><p><span></span>SR ICT is growing at a rapid pace, and the use of smartphones is an indicator that people are interested in ICT-related issues. The knowledge base and interest base are growing, and more opportunities are being created to that effect. The government has come up with ICT sanctions on the primary and secondary syllabus in schools, which are now mandated as core subjects. That is a huge step towards ICT development with the government supporting such initiatives, and it shows we are growing in the right direction. </p><h4>How would you assess the business environment in Zambia for startups like this one?</h4><p><strong>SS</strong> It is quite difficult to start a business on your own in Zambia. The environment is not particularly conducive, but the government and private institutions are taking steps to make it more so. They are trying to encourage startups to push forward their agenda through the Ministry of Youth or the Ministry of Communications. This is something that is progressing quickly. Small-scale companies are today being supported by larger entities. Our application is a pilot project funded by an enterprise called PEP Zambia, which supports private enterprises. through issuing a grant. There are several key players—large organizations— supporting smaller players like us. </p><h4>What is needed to create a larger network of start-ups in the country? </h4><p><span></span><strong>SS</strong> The biggest problem is the market for our services and products; we need large organizations to buy products and services from the smaller companies. We are competing with businesses that have been in the industry for hundreds of years. </p><p><span></span><strong>SR </strong>Many organizations would rather contract a foreign company for a smaller application even if it is something that Zambians can do. It is important to support local developers and corridors. </p><p><span></span><strong>SS </strong>We need support in terms of competition to let our services and products be bought. Some will pay five times more for a foreign company, even though we can do it better and in less time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the comparative advantages of Zambia as an investment destination compared to its neighboring countries?</h4><p>Strictly speaking, we have nine neighboring countries, as we share a water border with Burundi on Lake Tanganyika. This means that Zambia is blessed with multiple markets with which it can trade. Investors are not investing in a single-country market. The demand for goods has a wider market, beyond Zambia's domestic population of 13.5 million people. </p><h4>What role are the Multi-Facility Economic Zones (MFEZs) playing in the country??</h4><p>As the author of the MFEZ policy and the person who presented it to the full cabinet, I can only say that these special economic zones are key to permitting the processing of Zambia's local products, including minerals. What we need is to take a deliberate marketing initiative for the Zones internationally, explaining the incentives that go with investing in the MFEZs. We need to get investment into these zones so as to boost local value addition. This will increase the country's foreign earnings and create employment, ultimately reducing poverty levels.  </p><h4>What role can public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in developing Zambia's economy?</h4><p>That is one investment strategy that must be employed at a more serious level than we are doing at present. This country has a tremendous need for infrastructure development in the areas of roads, rail, and air travel. Our country needs an airline, and this is definitely an area in which we can set up a PPP with private investors to establish a national airline, bringing our national colors to the air and creating a valuable source of foreign currency and reducing capital flight which is at a high level through foreign airlines. Our road infrastructure has been suffering a lot of damage because of too much trucking, and the mining industry makes it difficult to maintain these roads in good condition. This is affecting the efficiency of moving goods, including the copper from the mining industry, which accounts for more than 80% of our export earnings. This country needs serious investment in railroads, which is another great potential area for PPPs.  Power generation is another sector where PPPs can work and should be encouraged. I believe mining companies should invest in these two sectors as they affect the sector's performance at both productivity and transportation levels. An improved  power generation sector will guarantee uninterrupted production in the mining sector while an efficient railway network will guarantee efficient movement of copper to the markets with reduced risk of accidents. </p><h4>How can you ensure that foreign investments translate into maximum benefit for Zambians?</h4><p>First and foremost, any investment permit in the natural resource or extractive industry should be first given to local Zambians, and let the local people attract partners who will then work with local people. This has major benefits, not only in terms of the attraction of capital, but also in the transfer of management and technical skills. We must emphasize partnerships between foreign investors and Zambians. Only short-term investors, “fly-by-nights,“ would not be willing to do partnerships. I do not believe in job creation alone as a benefit. Job creation is a benefit, but we must go beyond to actual ownership of the businesses by local people as this will create the much-needed entrepreneurial culture and help build a middle class. Once created, the middle class will demand numerous goods of a certain standard, hence boosting national productivity to meet the demand. We cannot afford to continue as a consumer nation, consuming goods and services produced in other countries; and we sit and wonder what happened to our exchange rate? The international market will only reward those who produce and have something to offer on the market otherwise we shall remain a dependent nation and our independence will remain a mockery.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which sectors have the greatest growth potential?</h4><p>I would definitely highlight agriculture. If you consider our climate, the quality of our soil, the volume of rainfall, and the amount of sunshine, the entire country could become the breadbasket of the continent. The Zambian government has developed a farm blocks program in each of the 10 provinces of Zambia. These will be demarcated with 100,000ha of land available for investment. We have started the process of marketing the farm blocks, and are in the process of identifying a partner for our farm block in the north. We put out a global tender and the response was quite overwhelming. Today, we have shortlisted four possible joint venture partners. We will be completing the process, and hopefully signing with a partner, by the end of September. We want to see major agricultural development. The same applies to the other nine provinces. We have set up many farm blocks and there is a lot of interest at the moment. One company intends to establish a sugar plantation on a large scale, while another is to focus on producing biofuels from cassava, working with small-scale farmers. In terms of mining, the northwestern province is the new Copperbelt.</p><h4>Which countries have shown the greatest interest in Zambia?</h4><p>The traditional investors in the mining sector have been the UK, Canada, Australia, and recently South Africa. Most of these companies now are increasing their capability in terms of reequipping old mines, while many greenfield mines are also emerging. In terms of Europe, the notable investors are from Germany and France. In this country, we have a major French producer of cement in Lafarge. Poland has also been a new and keen entrant into our country, interested in a number of sectors. Going further east, Japan for many years has been trading in Zambia. Every other vehicle you see is Japanese. Furthermore, India has continued to be a sustainable investor, as has Singapore. In December 2014, we signed an MoU with the Singapore Investment Center to promote new investments in our economy. We have also recently received strong overtures from the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, and China, too, is a growing investor. Its investments are broad-based, across agriculture, infrastructure, agro-processing, manufacturing, and others. Turkey has recently come on-stream with strong interest in Zambia. We have enjoyed complete political stability over the past 51 years having seen six democratically elected presidents, boosting investor confidence. And over the past decade GDP growth has averaged at 6.3%, in 2014 approaching 7%.</p><h4>Which large-scale projects is ZDA supporting?</h4><p>The farm block program is set to become a major development, and will be replicated nationwide. In addition, the multi-facility economic zones are pulling in notable new investment. Zambian Breweries has established a $32 million malting plant there. This is significant because in the past, Zambian breweries were not producing malt locally. They would get the barley and the farmers would sell the barley to Zambian breweries, but then they would export that to Zimbabwe where they had a malting plant, then reimport it. We were creating jobs in Zimbabwe and losing value because we exported for reimporting. By the end of 2015, the new plant will be ready. In Lusaka south, we also have a major pharmaceutical plant, which is going to be producing medical drugs, which we haven't done before. In terms of manufacturing, we can see some major developments taking place. Zambia Sugar came to us recently and we gave them a license. They are investing another $120 million to increase their production capacity at the new refinery. We also have a Chinese-Zambian joint venture keen on the cement sector with a $600 million plant. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Zambia and Kenya share history, a history evident in the similarity of our languages, traditions, and indeed, our aspirations. Like Zambia, Kenya longed for freedom in the days of Colonial rule and fought to build a prosperous, secure, and peaceful nation in its aftermath. These similarities moved our founding fathers to form close diplomatic ties once Kenya and Zambia had obtained independence. Both Kenneth Kaunda and Jomo Kenyatta were visionaries, as well as liberators. In their foresight, they saw that this continent would one day be totally liberated, which is why they supported the liberation movements across the continent, and why they played a full and concise part in the establishment of the Organization of African Unity. It now falls to us, the next generation, to fulfill their dream of freedom and prosperity for the peoples of these lands. This is a time to revitalize and strengthen our fraternal cooperation. Zambia and Kenya have the potential to revitalize and strengthen the growing exchange of goods and services, as this is a new era for Africa that will open tremendous opportunities. There is enormous potential for more robust growth. I believe that we could do more to grow the volume of trade between our two nations and people, and I trust that the Zambia International Trade Fair in Ndola will help forge the vital links. I know that businesses in both countries are keen to make the most of the opportunities that are so rapidly opening up. I know that we have learned through our experiences of the past and that we are determined to seize the day to make up for lost time and to raise Africa to its rightful place in the world. Yet our beliefs will remain little more than dreams if we do not unleash the energy and imagination of our entrepreneurs, our innovators, and especially our young people. Indeed that is why we are also celebrating the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi. Governments across the continent should turn now to creating the environment in which our most inventive and energetic people can thrive. I know and trust that my brother Mr. Lungu, and I will work together in this cause. That confidence is not born just of our already long history of cooperation, but also by discussion of a joint framework, which has hastened cooperation in fields as diverse as education and security. Indeed, at the end of last month, we agreed to initiate several memorandums of understanding, four of which, on police cooperation, tourism, gender equality and development and bilateral cooperation in the agricultural industry, have already been signed. Of course, there are a number of matters for which further consultation will be necessary. Perhaps the most important of these is the establishment of a special status agreement between our two nations. It is essential to mention and appreciate the Zambian government's assistance in matters of security. Given our long history and friendship, we regard Zambia as an ally. We must continue to work together to ensure that we achieve this long-deserved peace throughout the continent. We stand here as a generation that is the beneficiary of a previous struggle to free our nations, and our objective is to partner together to win the next struggle, namely for the economic liberation of our continent, the struggle to ensure prosperity for its peoples, the struggle to bring an end to poverty and poor health, and to create a better infrastructure for the peoples of Africa. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the meetings in Egypt recently regarding the Tripartite Free Trade Area (TFTA)? </h4><p>The launch of the TFTA and the signing of the TFTA signify an important political milestone towards the establishment and operation of a fully-fledged free trade area. It represents free movement of goods and services from Cape to Cairo, bringing together a market of over 625 million people, living in one of the fastest growth areas of the world with a booming middle class in 26 countries and a combined GDP of $1.3 trillion, about 60% of the African Continent's GDP. For Zambia, the TFTA represents a significant market for Zambian goods and services once effectively exploited. Total merchandise exports by TFTA members as of 2014 was $145 billion and merchandise imports of $211 billion. </p><h4>What incentives should be provided to move small entrepreneurs into the formal market?</h4><p>One of the key drivers of business informality is the high cost of doing business. When the procedures for starting a business and the licenses are expensive with tedious procedures, entrepreneurs avoid that cost by operating informally. This is why the Private Sector Development Reform Program is an important national priority. The measures to reduce the cost of doing business are bearing fruit as registration of SMEs at the Patents and Companies Registration Agency has grown substantially. Local authorities are now implementing single licensing systems to make it cheaper and more effective to formalize small businesses. We have now put in place a Business Regulatory Act and institutional framework that will mainstream tools such as Regulatory Impact Assessment into our policy-making systems. </p><h4>What are the comparative advantages of Zambia over neighboring countries, and why should an investor choose Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia's comparative advantages lie primarily in its abundant resources. It has vast land, 752,614 sqkm, with a population of approximately 15 million people, with over 70% of the population below the age of 40. We have vast natural resources in terms of minerals, tourist sites, water, and land for agriculture. The country has had a stable economy with growth averaging 6% over the last decade, stable inflation averaging 7% over the last five years as well as a stable political and social environment since the country gained independence in 1964. In terms of doing business, we are ranked fifth in Sub-Saharan Africa and third among the SADC Countries fourth in COMESA and eight in the whole of Africa pointing to the conduciveness of our business environment over most of our neighbors. We share borders with eight countries. Our central location in the region gives us a competitive market. Zambia has no controls on prices, interest rates, foreign exchange transactions, free repatriation of earnings and repayments as well as security and guarantees of full and fair compensation for investors. </p><h4>How do you describe the evolution of Multi-Facility Zones (MFEZs) and their role in achieving the three objectives of the triangle of Hope?</h4><p>The main objective of the MFEZ program in Zambia is to catalyze industrial and economic development through increased activity in the manufacturing sector with value addition to the numerous natural and agricultural raw materials. The zones are designed to provide a superior industrial and business platform. To date, three MFEZs have been established and are now fully operational. These are the Chambishi MFEZ on the Copperbelt, the Lusaka East and Lusaka South MFEZ's in Lusaka. The Chambishi and Lusaka East MFEZs are privately developed, while the Lusaka MFEZ is publicly owned. Over $1.5 billion has been invested in MFEZ's by developers and enterprises operating in the MFEZ's and in excess of 9,000 jobs have been created. More MFEZs are to be established. These includes an MFEZ in Maamba in Southern Province, Kalumbila and Lumwana in North Western Province and Chembe in Luapula Province.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the comparative advantages of Zambia over neighboring countries, and why should an investor enter the market?</h4><p>Zambia has many natural resources  as well as arable land, which have the potential to support farm processing industries in addition to creating jobs. In terms of agriculture, there is sufficient water. We have 30% of southern Africa's water resources, which adds to the potential for investors to find opportunities in agriculture in Zambia. In tourism, in addition to the Victoria Falls, the country has 34 game management areas. In terms of our business and regulatory framework, Zambia may be one of few countries with a dedicated unit placed at a high level in its cabinet office looking at business issues and regulatory frameworks in support of private-sector development. Since 2005, we have moved through different phases to ensure that the business environment becomes more competitive and that regulatory frameworks become increasingly business friendly. </p><h4>What role can public-private partnerships (PPPs) play in developing Zambia's economy?</h4><p>PPPs play a role of supporting the government implement its own infrastructure or service projects.  They are not meant as a substitute for government funding but are there to provide value for money and bring efficiency into the delivery of government services.  In the industrialization and job creation strategy about 45% of the funding is expected to be through the PPP mode. In 2015, we intend to facilitate capacity building within government ministries and agencies to equip them with requisite skills and knowledge to handle and manage.</p><h4>Which key projects will generate the most employment over the next two years?</h4><p>There are four sectors, namely construction, tourism, manufacturing, and agriculture, that have been identified as key for growth and job creation some of the jobs created are expected to be temporary such as in the construction sector but the majority that are being envisaged are the formal jobs. In all, we expect the jobs created to move people from poverty to a better level of livelihood.  Agriculture offers the greatest potential for jobs as a number of jobs are created along the entire value chain.</p><h4>One issue that Zambia faces is the number of people working in the informal sector. What are your strategies to move these people into the formal sector?</h4><p>People stay in the informal sector because they do not see the benefits of moving out. In this regard, we need to show people the benefits accrued to them when they become formal. Some of the ways in which we have tackled this is making it easier and more affordable for individuals to start a business, which in turn provides them with opportunities to access to finance, access to business development services, and technical assistance. </p><h4>What strategy should be followed to empower more women to become entrepreneurs?</h4><p>First investing in the education of women at all levels, primary, secondary, and tertiary. A highly educated and skilled women workforce will contribute to competitiveness in attracting FDI in industries with higher paying jobs that demand skilled labor. This investment also includes investing in the building of confidence of girls and women to believe in themselves. Secondly, promoting entrepreneurship through more targeted female programs that also provide more role models of successful woman entrepreneurs, mentoring programs and lastly also changing mindset of women to believe in themselves and show successful woman such as our Vice President as examples.</p><h4>How can the Cabinet Office ensure that growth is sustainable and inclusive in all stratas of society, especially in rural areas?</h4><p>Through the implementation of public and private sector reforms that make growth more inclusive such as empowerment of the youth with education and skills, aligning skills to job requirements, and creating avenues in rural areas for skilled youth employment. Ensuring that information about available programs and products or services are widely  disseminated through various platforms and channels.  </p><h4>What role does FDI play in Zambia versus local investment?</h4><p>FDI is important as a source of capital.  However, FDI should not be a substitute for local investment.  When Zambia liberalized its economy it did not have the capacity to mobilize local resources to support economic growth, and, therefore, FDI was viewed as a source of capital. The rationale behind this was to develop the economy by utilizing foreign capital, making it necessary but insufficient for economic growth. Long-term local investment is critical, which is why private sector development reforms are undertaken in Zambia so that the capacity of local businesses is increased to participate in the growth of the economy and to provide the requisite local investment for the economy.</p><h4>How many jobs seem set to be created by 2016?</h4><p>Our target is to create one million jobs by then,  one-third or possibly half of which should have materialized by end-2015. Yet while we remain optimistic, this all depends upon the government and various stakeholders working toward the same goal with maximum effort and within a strong coordination framework.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Critical Pivot]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[critical-pivot]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its foundation in 2010, what were some of the pivotal factors that have shaped the company up until this point?</h4><p>There are there key pivots that shaped our company and defined what we are today. Remember that NewBridge Pharmaceuticals is truly an innovative business model. It's a free enterprise backed by investors, not a family business, that hopefully and ultimately will be traded on one of the listed stock exchanges. This model in this shape and form didn't exist in the space nor the geographies we are in. So our first critical pivot is our ability to be the partner of choice for a number of big pharma companies from the likes of UCB, Eisai, Actavis, and Genomic Health for some of their innovative therapeutics or molecular diagnostics in the whole region. The second defining factor of our success is our ability to raise capital. Since NewBridge's inception, we have raised close to $70 million and we are about to close on another round of financing to get us a little shy than $100 million in capital over the last five years. Last but not least by any means, is our ability to attract a diverse regional pool of talent. Our team is strong, experienced, entrepreneurial, and driven. These are the traits of the “NewBridgers" as we refer to ourselves. Through these talents we were able to establish a very competitive force in the space where we compete. With all these three pivots, we have been able to establish a strong name for ourselves in a short period of time and really stand out given our small size.</p><h4>What competitive advantages do you offer to the market that makes partners and investors particularly keen to work with you?</h4><p>When you look at the pharmaceutical industry today, you see innovation coming from two categories: big pharma, and small or midsize companies, with a lot of innovation coming from biotech companies. When these small or mid-size companies want to reach the world, their initial focus is usually the US, Europe, and Japan. As for the rest of the world, they usually prefer a partnering model, and depending on the country or the region in question they usually prefer a regional partner and this was the white space and niche we found for ourselves. These innovative companies usually want to access emerging markets, get a piece of the action and the growth, but at the same time they don't want to establish structures themselves in each country or region. They have a very focused strategy and also finite resources, hence the partnering model. NewBridge Pharmaceuticals observed this growing trend, hence acted and positioned itself accordingly. MENA, with all its population, still only represents around 2% of the total global pharmaceutical market and it is very fragmented. This has put pressure on some of the smaller companies to elect not to be physically present here, but rather look for partners who can become an extension to their values, their best practices, and their compliance to market their products. That's where NewBridge comes in; we have the expertise, network, and the distribution channels, to drive innovative pharmaceutical products to the market and be the one-stop solution to these companies across multiple geographies.</p><h4>What is the outlook for future investment and partnership with NewBridge?</h4><p>The next big thing on our horizon is taking a look at partnerships and investment on much larger levels. Frankly speaking, there is a lot of interest from regional investors and outsiders from the US and Europe who are ready now to engage and take us to the next level up. The next level up for us is a number of things. We proved to ourselves that we have the ability to attract big partners and work with them on big brands. We have proved to ourselves that we are trustworthy and capable partner of choice that meet our partners high demands of compliance, quality, and performance. We will continue to do what we are doing best and improve further on same direction—that is the mainstay of our business. However, we need to take NewBridge to another place as well, where we become the MAH and owner of number of products. This could be achieved through M&amp;A efforts on brands or plants, and we are looking into both. We will be able to achieve this by partnering with regional investors who like our story, want to invest in healthcare and partner with us in this journey. As they say, “you have to look back to see ahead," and when I look back to what we were able to do with this company on the partnering and the financing front over a relatively short period of time, I feel very optimistic for the outlook and the future of this company.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What advice would you give to German agriculture investors wanting to set up in Zambia?</h4><p>Zambia has vast land and a population that is eager to learn and to be productive. The country has huge potential. This also has to be developed. Investing in Zambia strikes me as pioneering work and provides the chance to grow with the future developments in this country. Increases in yields will not only enhance Zambia's condition, but what's more, neighbouring countries will benefit from the development. The investor should thus not only see Zambia as a market, but also recognize opportunities in neighboring countries. The Zambian-German Agricultural Knowledge and Training Centre will increase the availability of trained staff to use modern technology and apply sustainable production methods in Zambian agriculture to make future investments in the country viable.</p><h4>What are some of the principal challenges faced by Zambian farmers?</h4><p>Given the extensive resources of land, labor, and water in Zambia, the potential to expand the country's agricultural production. Furthermore the government has embarked on a land development program, which involves opening up new farming blocks for commercial development and the expansion of the agriculture sector. Farmers need to come together and find solutions suitable for their situation. Education is the secret to resilience and adaptation to future challenges. Farmers can only develop and adapt to the changing climate and market requirements when they have received the appropriate education. Schools, universities, and institutions should provide young people with an excellent education to succeed. Germany contributes to these efforts through the Zambian-German Agricultural Knowledge and Training Centre.</p><h4>Climate change is changing the way agriculture is being practiced the world over. What are some of the things that Germany is doing to deal with climate change?</h4><p>Germany's farming sector success is based mainly on animal husbandry. To a large extent maize or wheat is grown in Germany not only to feed its population, but also as feed for the country's livestock. These and other crops also play an important role in the generation of renewable energy. Other suitable measures of environmental protection and sustainable agricultural production is adapting no-till farming practices, not allowing the burning of straw, and minimizing air pollution from agricultural machinery. German research institutions are working on adoption strategies for agriculture to cope with the challenge of climate change. It seems that some countries will be more affected by climate change than others. This is why AKTC also has the word “knowledge" in its name. Over the coming year the center will work to adapt production systems that can be more flexible in their response to these challenges. We hope that AKTC can contribute somewhat to the question to climate change.</p><h4>What is your government's position on GMOs, and do you think they are a solution to Zambia's food security challenges?</h4><p>Genetically modified food products are labeled as such in the EU and they are rarely sold in Germany, because of consumer reservations. Feed, especially soy, which is labeled as “genetically modified," is widespread and used by farmers in many instances. There is a German initiative at EU level to introduce obligatory labeling for food produced with GM feed. Products that are made from GM cotton such as clothing, hygiene products, and bandages are widespread as well and accepted by the vast majority of consumers. There is large opposition by NGOs against the cultivation of GM crops. A draft law has been presented which would allow to restrict or ban at the national level the cultivation of GM crops authorized at the EU-level for “compelling reasons" other than those relating to risks to health or environment. The Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture has introduced this draft law, which is currently under discussion within the federal government. GM crops can, in certain instances, contribute to food security, and create crops tolerant against heat or salty soils. Whether these crops are suitable for Zambia depends upon the regional and local circumstances where such GM crops could be cultivated, and this must be decided by Zambia. </p><p><em>*Image: J.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key priorities established by your government for 2015-16?</h4><p>Our economic development agenda has been guided by the National Vision, which foresees Zambia becoming a prosperous middle-income country by 2030. My government is determined to ensure that Zambia's socio-economic status is improved in an effort to raise the living standards of our citizenry. Our focus is not simply for the period 2015-16, but for the long term, and for this reason my government has prioritised agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, energy, water development, and mining. We also aspire to be a developed country by 2064 through a transformational agenda which prioritises seven key areas: diversification and sustainable development; infrastructure development; human capital development; democracy and good governance; gender and social protection; economic diplomacy, and global partnerships and national and cultural re-modeling. Sustainable national development has also been a central priority for our nation. The record of our diversification programme over the past 50 years has not been satisfactory. As a country we have continuously depended on copper production with about 80% of our export earnings still coming from this mineral. Copper highly exposes us to the dynamics of the fluctuations of copper on the global market, so we are clear that we have to diversify away to other priority economic areas such agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, and infrastructural development in order to stimulate economic growth. </p><p>Investment opportunities abound in other areas, but the success of diversification lies in the prioritisation of development. For this reason, we need to focus on promoting tourism and value addition to the mineral and agricultural products which have the greatest potential to contribute to rapid economic diversification. We should also be cognisant of the fact that our diversification agenda will not be complete without agro processing. Our manufacturing sector must be driven by growth in agro-processing and forestry products ensuring that we do not export raw materials and add value to all our primary products. In the area of infrastructure development, as we discuss economic development we cannot ignore this important subject. My government's goal is to ensure that Zambia becomes the preferred transit point in the region. To achieve this, the government is investing in road, rail, air and water transportation. A transport master plan is being devised to ensure that the development of the transport system in Zambia is done in an integrated manner linking airports, harbors, dry ports, and trade centers. This will easily guarantee the transportation of goods and services to markets within the country and beyond. With specific reference to the road sector, the government will accelerate the implementation of road projects under the Link Zambia 8,000 project inter alia, as a means of improving connectivity and transportation of goods and services. This will be done by utilizing PPPs to finance selected roads. I wish to also highlight the industrialization program we are implementing under the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) as part of the overall transformational agenda. We believe that our economy must progressively be controlled by citizens, with broad-based citizen economic empowerment and interventions that will ensure that citizens have significant control of economic activities in the agriculture, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. This will be achieved through joint ventures between foreign investors and citizens.</p><h4>How would you describe the importance of a harmonized legal framework in the SADC region to promote international trade and commerce among its members?</h4><p>Zambia is a member of the SADC, and together with other member states have set themselves ambitious economic objectives. There are attempts by member countries to integrate their markets gradually through a commitment to reducing trade barriers in goods and services, and aligning their economic and financial policies. In this regard, a free-trade zone has extended across the region since 2008, enabling the duty-free trade of goods. Negotiations are now underway for the liberalization of trade in services in a number of sectors. Since coming into force, the SADC Finance and Investment Protocol (FIP) has provided a legal framework for the regional harmonization of finance and investment policies. Alongside the SADC Secretariat, which acts as coordinator and manager of the regional integration process, Member States are responsible for putting regional rulings and decisions into effect at a national level. At the same time, representatives of the private sector also have an important part to play. Their inclusion in the strategic and thematic discussions of various aspects of integration ensures that the discussions and ultimately decisions made respond to the needs of the private sector.</p><h4>Zambia hosted the Joint Committee on UN Reforms in Livingstone and recently received the visit of Helen Clark, the Administrator of the UNDP. What role would you like Zambia to play within the UN institution?</h4><p>Zambia has been a member of the UN for the last 50 years hence our partnership with this global body is key to our country achieving economic growth and development. This commitment by the UN to Zambia is shown through the high level visits to Zambia of UN officials. Zambia is greatly honored to have hosted the second Summit of the African Union Committee of Ten (C-10) Heads of State and Government on the Reform of the United Nations Security Council in May this year after the Summit that was held in Oyo in the Republic of Congo in 2014. The Summit sought to examine developments in ongoing Inter-Governmental Negotiations on the Security Council Reform process among other topics.  Zambia's hosting of this Summit is an indication of  the role that we ought to play in ensuring that the aspirations of this Committee are achieved. During the Livingstone Summit l underscored the need for us to again demand that Africa be heard and granted its place at the Security Council table. Seven decades of the UN has been incomplete without Africa's participation in the Security Council. Around 70% of the Security Council agenda is on Africa, but the continent remains the only region that is totally excluded from making decisions on issues affecting it.</p><h4>What are the general improvements to be contained in the draft constitution that would be subject to referendum in 2016?</h4><p>My government is committed to delivering a people-driven constitution. The final draft constitution was released to the general public in October, 2014 to enable them study it and make comments. As a follow-up, the government has published the Constitution (amendment) Bill, 2015 containing non-contentious clauses, and is scheduled for presentation to parliament. I urge all Zambians to take keen interest in this Bill and engage their members of Parliament to ensure that their views are well-represented and taken into account when the debate begins. The decision to present the non-contentious clauses for enactment by Parliament is informed by the real danger of losing even the progressive and non-contentious provisions of the draft constitution if the entire document was subjected to a referendum. To demonstrate the government's commitment to delivering a people-driven constitution, the Referendum Act has been amended in anticipation of the referendum, and will be held concurrently with the 2016 general elections. This amendment expressly mandates the Electoral Commission of Zambia to be the Referendum Commission and institutionalizes the way in which future referenda will be conducted. Further, it is necessary to hold the referendum alongside next year's general elections to enhance the chances of success and also to make the whole process more cost-effective. If these improvements are passed, the election date will be enshrined in the Constitution, but will not be part of the referendum since it is not in the Bill of Rights. A proposal to allow Dual Citizenship will also be approved by referendum, while the threshold for winning Presidential elections will be set at 50% plus one vote, and will not require a referendum. Finally, the Bill of Rights has been improved, and this will also involve approval by referendum.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Zambia is currently very active in the UN and all it processes. Zambia has a seat on the UN General Assembly's open working group for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As well as this, Zambia has hosted the UN World Tourism Organization conference and is sending peace keepers to the Central African Republic. Therefore, a lot is going on in Zambia that is supportive of the UN system. </p><p>The aim of the SDGs is to complete the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Zambia did well on getting children to primary schools and pretty much every child in Zambia has had primary schooling. The prevalence of HIV and AIDS has also been reduced substantially. For Zambia as a country, it is important to focus on the significant inequalities in the country, in particular between rural and urban areas and between men and women. This means ensuring that no one is left behind in extreme poverty, with no school and inability to access healthcare. The SDGs are about people and the planet. If the environment is degraded, that has an adverse effect on the population. We see that in the climate ecosystem. Zambia is finding itself with less predictable rainfall, and there is a need to stop the loss of Zambian forests as well. An area, about the size of Zanzibar is lost every year. In the climate conference in Paris, Zambia will be presenting its REDD-plus plan, which is about reducing greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation. Zambia will have a comprehensive program that looks at forestry policy, agriculture policy, and energy policy. To tackle these issues, there must be a comprehensive government approach. Fundamentally, rural poverty is also an issue within forestry, because people need energy for cooking and heating. The UNDP has been working with Zambia on climate change issues and we support Zambia with is contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing forest loss. Finally, we had a very successful meeting over the last few days on the “HeforShe Campaign," which is a major UN campaign to enlist men and boys in support of women's equality. It focuses on issues like gender-based violence, underage marriage, and other issues like girls without education or healthcare. </p><p>In terms of the FfD conference, there are three main areas of interest that I would like to stress. Firstly, the commitment of developed countries to 0.7% of gross national income to be targeted for official development assistance was reaffirmed. Nevertheless, Zambia has already moved into the lower-middle income status and this donor money is channeled into low-income countries, as well as regions where catastrophic emergencies arise; like the Syrian crisis or South Sudan. There are a lot of humanitarian needs out there. The second tier is the issue of developing domestic resources. To develop the economy in a sustainable way, there is need to build capacity, attract more foreign and domestic investment and have a certain capacity to train. The third area of interest is that financing for development has to be risk-informed. We live in a world of great volatility. If you put all your eggs in one basket economically, you stand to be disadvantaged if that one commodity suddenly declines in value. Globalization certainly has its benefits, but it also brings increased exposures and countries have to be conscious of the risks if their economic basis is too narrow. </p><p>Despite Zambia being a low-to-middle-income country, many of its people are living in extreme poverty and there are many needs. On the other hand, Zambia has tremendous potential to grow its domestic economy and to get more value from the extractive industries, through the incorporation of local SMEs into the value chains for these industries. Tourism in Zambia has tremendous potential, so does agriculture. There needs to be a greater focus on broadening the base of the economy and bringing people into the tax net. </p><p><em>*Image: Maureen Lynch</em></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[rail-in-comparison]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Perurail become part of Belmond Group?</h4><p>Previously, the railway was government-owned, but because of economic loss, the government decided to concession it. In 1999, after an international bidding process, we obtained the concession of the railways for the south and southeast. The concession was granted to a part of what is now called the Belmond Group. We have been with the business for 16 years now.</p><h4>What is the role of Perurail in the areas of the country where you are present today?</h4><p>The role of Perurail can be divided into two main businesses: passenger and cargo. The passenger business is from Cusco to Machu Picchu, which serves one of the country's most popular tourism attractions, and from Cusco to Lake Titicaca. We move about 2 million passengers on the track on a yearly basis. On the cargo side, we mainly move cargo from the mines to the ports. From the port, incoming items will go to places like Arequipa, Puno and Cusco. We mainly move fuel and diesel to the bigger cities in the southern part of Peru.</p><h4>What is the balance in the business between cargo and tourism?</h4><p>Our tourism business is larger than our cargo, but that difference will disappear as we recently signed a transportation contract with MMG, a mining company. We estimate that by the end of next year, we will be moving about four million tons of cargo.</p><h4>On the Machu Picchu route, Perurail had a monopoly, but now there is competition. How did that change the way that Perurail had to approach that business?</h4><p>We never had a complete monopoly; we were just the only ones in business, even though it was open access. Starting in 2008, other companies started entering the business, and now we are working alongside them because the line has plenty of capacity for more trains.</p><h4>What would you say distinguishes your services from their services on that line?</h4><p>The biggest difference is that we have a luxury line offering services that our competitors do not. All of our train services have the international certification of quality ISO 9001. We offer our passengers not just a journey, but an experience aboard the trains with the view, food, entertainment, music, dance, and of course our service. We take care of our customers and their needs. Also, we provide different social train services for the community located in our influence area, supporting their daily social, cultural, and commercial activities.</p><h4>What is involved in attracting customers who are looking for the luxury train?</h4><p>There is a big market for the luxury sector, and our model is based on reaching that demographic. Belmond as a group has luxury hotels, trains, and resorts all over the world.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges of operating mineral transport in Peru?</h4><p>The biggest challenge we have is ensuring the safety of our operations, and because of that, our railway is maintained to international standards. We also comply with the American standards of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), for all classes of our railways. Both the safety of the people and the safety of the minerals are covered. We have developed a new way of implementing service containers to move the mineral from the mine to the port. We transfer from roads to trains without ever touching the copper concentrate, keeping the minerals and the workers safe. This mechanism reduces the impact on the environment with clean technology.</p><h4>What would you say are the biggest challenges for growth in the tourism sector for Peru and Perurail?</h4><p>Having a single railway line between Cusco and Machu Picchu is a major challenge. That means that the capacity of the trains is limited, and in order to increase to meet growing tourism numbers, we will need to invest in more signage for trains to pass. We have to improve the quantity of trains per day, and we will need to invest in more areas to park trains. We will have to continue working with the Ministry of Transportation to accomplish these things, and to have a plan for growth for years to come.</p><h4>How do you feel about the concession and PPP infrastructure here in Peru?</h4><p>I agree that the concessions that were promoted by the government helped with the development of the country. We are receiving capital that will help the country grow in a proper way with high-quality companies that are efficient and have lots of experience in different sectors.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Perurail in the coming years?</h4><p>In the next five years, we will continue growing at a rate of 10% per year. We will continue to invest in Machu Picchu on a yearly basis in track capacity and services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the largest bank in Lebanon, how does Bank Audi contribute to the country's GDP?</h4><p>We are the largest contributor to GDP formation in Lebanon. Our contribution amounts to close to 1.8%, which is huge, especially when you consider that there are more than 600,000 economic units in the country, and for one single unit to contribute as much as we do is very significant. We are also the largest employer in the private sector and the largest deposit taker. We are also the largest financier to the domestic economy in both its public and private sector components. Moreover, we are the largest taxpayer underscoring our large sense of corporate governance and social responsibility. We have a fiduciary responsibility as the largest bank in the country towards the financial sector as a whole, and a responsibility to adhere to best practices in terms of governance, compliance, and financial disclosure.</p><h4>How would you assess the last financial year for Bank Audi, and what do you expect for 2015?</h4><p>The fact that Bank Audi is a group rather than a single bank means our consolidated position encompasses the financials of principally 11 banks and three financial companies present in 12 countries outside Lebanon, covering various business lines. We cannot link the consolidated performance to only one single operating environment and the Group's activity is not evenly spread across the 12 countries. There are in fact four main development pillars: Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, and the private banking business line which represent more than 90% of assets and earnings.</p><p>The soundness of the diversification strategy adopted by the Bank was again confirmed by the Bank's performance in 2014, efficiently driving a sustained growth in spite of the persisting challenging operating environment while enhancing the Group's competitive positioning. Consolidated assets grew by 15.9% to exceed, for the first time, the $40 billion threshold, highlighting the Bank's capacity to attract new customers and expand its range of services. In parallel, consolidated net profits rose by 15% relative to 2013 to reach $350 million, translating into an ROAE of 13.6%. This performance stems in particular from entities operating in Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and private banking entities and reinforced the Group's position among the top 20 Arab banks at large.</p><p>The results of 1H2015 are in line with those achieved in 2014, whereby the Group's performance continued to reflect Bank Audi's privileged position in key markets of presence. Indeed, we have an undisputed leadership in Lebanon, we are also the seventh private sector's bank in Egypt and the thirteenth deposit bank in Turkey out of 34 operating commercial banks in just 30 months of operation. We have also close to $10 billion in assets under management booked in our private banking entities mainly in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, a level which compares well with that of the regional Arab banking institutions.</p><h4>How are Bank Audi's operations in Turkey developing and how do you envision Odea Bank advancing over the medium term?</h4><p>Starting from scratch in November 2012, the assets of Odea Bank, our subsidiary in Turkey, reached $10.8 billion at end-June 2015, reflecting a solid customer attraction and business development capacity, and positioning Odea Bank 13th among the deposits bank in Turkey.</p><p>In parallel, Odea Bank has started to be profitable after 19 months since launch, posting $15.8 million net profits in 2014. In 1H2015, Odea Bank recorded $16.6 million of net earnings, representing a rising trend that management is looking to turn into an exponential growth.</p><p>This performance is attributed to the fact that Turkey is a sizeable emerging country with a track record of sustained economic growth, reaching on average 5.4% per annum over the last 4 years, but also to the best-in breed talent pool of Odea Bank and its pioneering role in terms of innovation, granting it significant market competitive advantages.</p><p>Building on the significant performances achieved so far, our plan in Turkey is to develop a value-added SMEs and consumer lending segment while leveraging on the wide footprint in the MENA region to benefit from the expected growth of trade, financial and human flows between Turkey and Arab countries to further develop corporate and commercial banking.</p><p>Today, Turkey is subject to a lot of volatility as a result of the change in the policies of the US Federal Reserve Bank and of the prevailing domestic political disputes impacting the sentiment of foreign and local investors and affecting the exchange rates and banking operating conditions. This environment may slightly delay our business plan but we, as long-term investors, are confident we are going to achieve our growth targets in Turkey over the medium term despite of the highly vilified environment in the short term against which we are putting in place the needed contingency planning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of the air, maritime, and land business lines are most preferred by your clients?</h4><p>For clients with large volumes, maritime is the obvious choice. You can ship a lot more and for much less. In terms of which industries predominate among our clients, there are diverse sectors and industries represented, but we deal with many textiles and clothing companies, be it primary materials or finished value-added products. We also deal with machinery, white goods, and so forth, where every type of merchandise requires different procedures and time frames, and has different logistical needs. If there are no customs restrictions or tariffs involved, we can get everything through the port and on its way in one day, but it depends on the goods we're dealing with.</p><h4>How important is IT in your operations?</h4><p>It's all about the IT. With logistics operations as complicated as they are today, this can only be done with a solid information technology infrastructure. These processes can take weeks, even months, and you're dealing with paperwork, bureaucracy, physical transportation of goods coordinated across different lines of transport, going through different juridical and political zones with different customs laws and tariffs, and you have to meet your client's expectations to get it there on time and in the right place with everything intact and undamaged. So without a solid IT base, you'd be lost. This has enabled us to be a one-stop shop for our clients, so they only have to deal with us and leave the logistics in our hands.</p><h4>How have certain trade restrictions affected business?</h4><p>This is especially seen in the textiles and clothing segment, as various different tariffs and quotas apply there in different categories. We've seen that our clients are easily discouraged by this, and our country reacts by shutting its own doors to trade, unwilling to tackle the issue except in a knee-jerk way. We at Seyrema are of course in the middle of it all, but we too are affected when our clients are affected. I think it's important not to act desperately or in a knee-jerk way, but instead to take one's time, analyze the situation, make the necessary diplomatic or political interventions, and come up with a strategic plan accordingly. This goes both for our own government and for companies engaged in foreign trade, who can take certain measures as well. For example, instead of shipping or exporting things in large volumes, they may have to do it in small batches, using smaller ships or containers.</p><p>Protectionism, import restrictions, and tariffs are a challenge, but instead of fearing these and becoming pessimistic, companies and governments should consider them obstacles that can be overcome, not just through trade practices and mechanisms, but also in terms of lobbying their own governments and foreign government. Trade restrictions are always essentially a political decision and it's up to the government and the relevant ministry to try and reestablish an equitable balance in trade between two countries. These have always been a factor in international trade and always will be, so we have to work this into our strategic planning instead of thinking of this as a crisis.</p><h4>What's your strategic plan for this year?</h4><p>We're focusing on synergy this year. We have to take time to analyze the situation, and the recent import restrictions and protectionism have slowed things down. We've been around 15 years and we've seen all the highs and lows, so we consider this period to be a fortunate one, because we can take stock and chart our path forward accordingly. The aim, as always, is to continually grow. We want to work with our clients and our customers to try and find ways to diversify and find solutions to various trade restrictions. Companies have to think creatively, diversify. The government has to be proactive and dynamic. If there are restrictions and anti-dumping legislation affecting clothing producers and exporters, they have to find ways to overcome it. If you just stay rigid and refuse to adapt and innovate, you're not going to last.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The insurance industry in Zambia is competitive, with over 25 companies currently operating. How would you describe the business landscape for companies, and is there the potential for consolidation?</h4><p>The insurance industry has seen significant growth in terms of the number of companies and those with licenses. There is an increased interest in the industry, and there are many applications currently being processed for new insurance businesses. Generally, the economy has been doing well, and so amid rising GDP a number of businesses have felt the nation's potential across various sectors. With a growing economy, there needs to be proper insurance infrastructure to support business. Among aspects precipitating growth are our low capitalization requirements, which have made it easier for players to enter the market. Consequently, we anticipate the government issuing new guidelines and standards for these new entities, as strong entities provide greater security for their policyholders. When the statutory requirements for capital are issued by the ministry we will likely see consolidation and companies listing on the capital market. There is already interest from insurance companies to be listed, and we anticipate companies injecting more money to reach their required capital levels. As a result, we anticipate more protection for policyholders, which would be good for the industry and economy alike.</p><h4>Do you see predominately international or domestic interest?</h4><p>We see international interest, but there are also local players wanting to enter the market. The challenge lies in accessing finance, but the interest is there.</p><h4>What steps is the PIA taking to increase insurance penetration, which remains at 3%?</h4><p>Last year, one of our strategies was related to micro insurance, while the other was related to financial literacy and education. In order to encourage people to take up insurance and appreciate the need for it, especially in areas such as agriculture, tourism, and SMEs, we are engaged in a wide range of activities. We expect to see increasing insurance uptake and subsequent rising penetration levels.</p><h4>What role does innovation play in broadening the insurance market?</h4><p>Technology provides a platform for insurance to be made accessible to quite a number of people. We need more innovation, especially for technology to extend our reach; this is one area we are trying to properly regulate as an authority. Providing a product is one thing, but in terms of regulation, we want to ensure that subscribers are getting their claims paid.</p><h4>What are the specific steps that should be taken to improve access?</h4><p>This is one of the hindering areas in need of improvement. If there is a tax on insurance, the policy becomes less affordable to the man on the street. The government needs to alleviate the tax on certain types of insurance in order to increase access, especially in terms of micro insurance. This is the area through which we are trying to reach the mass market, and we trust that the government will adopt a favorable position and eliminate the tax.</p><h4>Are there other ways to encourage and incentivize micro insurance?</h4><p>Insurance companies, as business entities, can become more innovative by embedding micro insurance into areas surrounding the product, especially with life insurance or investment. We can expect the rules and provisions to become less stringent to ease access for those making claims.</p><h4>Considering that non-life insurance makes up the bulk of business, what is the opportunity for life insurance segment growth?</h4><p>Over the years, we have seen life insurance grow, and a number of life insurance companies are on the rise. Through insurance education, more people are developing an appreciation of this segment. Many of the issues regarding life insurance have something to do with cultural backgrounds, and so there is a need to start there and break down some preconceived ideas. Slowly people are beginning to understand the value of this type of insurance.</p><h4>What role does takaful insurance play in the PIA?</h4><p>We have taken takaful on as a new product for the market. In terms of principles, it is like any traditional insurance in terms of payments. The real interest comes from the Islamic community; that said; non-Muslims have participated as well. PIA's aim to is capture what is happening in the economy. We need to enhance financial inclusion, which will give us more options to offer those seeking insurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>ADB is directed toward eradicating poverty and developing infrastructure. How does ADB assess the progression of Malaysia with regard to its internal development?</h4><p>Malaysia is a middle-income country with a record of strong economic performance and poverty reduction. Resilient economic growth over the past five decades has enabled Malaysia to transform itself from an under-developed country reliant on natural resources into a middle-income country (MIC) with a vibrant manufacturing sector, achieving many of its Millennium Development Goals well ahead of the 2015 target. Malaysia has also made notable progress in reducing carbon dioxide emissions, deforestation, and the spread of HIV/AIDS. As an open and trade-reliant economy, Malaysia nonetheless remains vulnerable to external shocks, and is tackling its medium-term challenges that include a weakening current account surplus and achieving fiscal sustainability. Malaysia's efforts to expand intra-regional trade have helped to offset the weak economic outlook of its traditional trading partners in the EU, and the government is implementing key fiscal and policy reforms, and diversifying its fiscal revenue streams. At this juncture in its development, Malaysia's core challenge is to avoid the so-called “middle-income trap," whereby MICs are unable to increase incomes due to sluggish growth rates. Without the cost advantages of low-income countries for labor-intensive sectors, MICs can become trapped by slow growth unless new strategies are adopted to help move MICs up the value chain. Malaysia needs to enhance private sector investments, increase productivity, and leverage its competitiveness in strategic areas in order to expand export opportunities. In this regard, Malaysia has embarked on a series of policy initiatives, such as the Economic Transformation Program launched in 2010, to supplement its five year development plans. The overarching goal of the recently launched the 11th Malaysia Plan, 2016-2020 (11MP) is for Malaysia to achieve “high-income country" status by 2020 through strategic structural transformations that counterbalance the headwinds of faltering commodity and energy prices.</p><h4>ADB re-engaged with Malaysia through the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) and its support for the 10MP, which helped public-private partnerships (PPPs) in banking, amongst other developments. What aspirations does the ADB have for the 11MP?</h4><p>A founding member of Asian Development Bank (ADB), Malaysia resumed country-level engagement with ADB in November 2011 under an Arrangement of Cooperation (AOC), which is anchored by an interim country partnership strategy (CPS) that supported implementation of the 10MP (2011-2015). A country operations and business plan (COBP) is being extended to 2018 in alignment with the 11MP (2016-2020) to support continued collaboration on the three pillars of the CPS. They are as follows: (i) promoting the national anchoring of regional cooperation and integration, (ii) highlighting knowledge partnerships; and (iii) catalyzing private investments by developing PPPs. In addition to providing technical assistance to support preparation of the 11MP, ADB is partnering with Malaysia on subregional coordination initiatives and the management of green cities, in line with the country's sustainable development agenda. On catalyzing private investments through PPPs, ADB supported the establishment of the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund (AIF), with Malaysia contributing a total of $150 million in equity as well as AIF's incorporation in Labuan, Malaysia. Given that Malaysia is the current Chair of the AIF Board of Directors, ADB is closely coordinating with Malaysia on AIF operations to provide financing for infrastructure development projects in all ASEAN member countries. Under the 11MP, Malaysia is expected to further enhance infrastructure connectivity projects thru PPPs, thus helping to spur increased levels of trade, tourism, and investment within the ASEAN region.</p><h4>Malaysia is a key member of ASEAN and is one of four countries in the BIMP-EAGA. In what ways will ADB assist Malaysia to develop itself through the course of these organizations?</h4><p>ADB's emphasis on regional cooperation and integration (RCI) is consistent with ASEAN's call for greater economic integration. At the subregional level, Malaysia is deeply committed to promoting RCI and is a leading member of both the Brunei Darussalam—Indonesia—Malaysia—Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP—EAGA) and the Indonesia—Malaysia—Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT—GT) subregional cooperation programs. For BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT, ADB serves as active advisor and development partner by supporting the formulation of their strategic directions and by financing their RCI projects. Malaysia's commitment to subregional cooperation is also reflected in its direct support for the Center for IMT-GT (CIMT), which is based in Putrajaya, Malaysia. </p><p><span></span>The development partnership between Malaysia and ADB is also reflected in the country's involvement in a number regional technical assistance (RETAs) and knowledge products. On average, about 20 officials from various ministries and line agencies in Malaysia participate in such RETAs and their associated training programs on an annual basis. Key RETA activities and outcomes include knowledge workshops and conferences, strengthening policy dialogue and coordination, as well as collaboration on key regional initiatives, such as development of regional financial markets, prudential and supervision standards for Islamic financial markets, and in promotion of trade facilitation.</p><h4>Can you summarize the potential and the direction of growth in Malaysia?</h4><p>The current status and future direction of Malaysia has been extensively analyzed in the recently published Asian Development Outlook (ADO). Overall, the ADO states that Malaysia, as a major exporter of energy and commodities, is faced with weak demand and a slump in prices for these exports. Yet, Malaysia's economic structure is increasingly diversified, as services and manufacturing now account for 80% of GDP. The removal of fuel subsidies and the broadening of the tax base through the goods and services tax should help pave the way to a balanced budget over the medium-term, and reduce the country's debt to GDP ratio.  Foreign currency reserves remain healthy, and the current account is expected to remain in surplus as Malaysia maintains a flexible exchange rate system. Finally, ASEAN will soon launch the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) and Malaysia stands to benefit from accelerated subregional economic and financial integration. Malaysia, as the current chair of ASEAN, once again plays an important role in defining the post-2015 agenda for the AEC, which will continue to emphasize the free flow of goods, services, and investments, as well as greater mobility of skilled labor and capital. Tangible benefits from the AEC will include an expanded range of goods and services at lower prices, which will benefit countries like Malaysia with outward-looking trade and investment policies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did BCCT's partnership with UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) come about?</h4><p>There was an initiative launched in 2012 by the Ministry of Trade and Investment under then-minister Lord Green. The issue was that the UK government wanted to look at how they could help create a global ecosystem of support for British exporters. Lord Green came up with this initiative, whereby they would look at the 20 fastest growing emerging markets, which at the time included Turkey. They wanted to see how they could bring the knowledge and experience of UKTI together with the other British business NGOs, including the British chambers of commerce and other British business groups. UKTI had a budget from the British Government to provide financial support so that British NGOs could enhance their capabilities so they could work hand-in-hand with the UKTI team. Over time UKTI would transfer services it was providing over to the chambers and other organizations. This was launched in March 2013. At that time all the 20 markets were invited to London and the respective overseas business networks (OBNs) delivered their business plans and discussed what services they could offer that would be comparable and complementary to what UKTI was already doing. The UKTI team in London assessed our plan and whether it would add value for them. Once approved by the UKTI, the government would then provide funding, which would initially last for two years.</p><h4>What are your current aims?</h4><p>Our main priority is still our members, of which we have over 400 paying members, the key to maintaining sustainable membership is providing a value exchange that is relevant and consistent.. Plus we have our major sponsors; we wanted to make sure that the big British investors in Turkey would be represented on our board, companies like Unilever, BP, Vodafone, Shell, HSBC, and so on. Those big players gave us that credibility so that UK companies could see that we have serious experience and knowledge availability from those  large multinationals in our organization. The UK has been the largest investor in Turkey over the last 10 years, so we have a very strong relationship with Turkey and our bi-lateral trade continues to grow YoY, currently at around $12-13 billion with about 65% of that being Turkey-to-UK exports. Our aim is to balance that out and get it more 50-50 and more in favor of the UK if we can. It's the opposite in terms of investment, with very little Turkish investment in the UK up until 2014. The breakthrough came with Ülker's purchase of United Biscuits. That wasn't just a big investment for Turkey but a big investment globally. That set the scene for other Turkish companies who could see what can be done in the UK and what other investment opportunities there are for them. We use that transaction as a case study for transparency and efficiency, and how easy it could be for other Turkish companies. Another part of our strategy is to engage with Turkish chambers of commerce. We have MoUs signed with 14 of the biggest Turkish chambers, from Van in the East, through Gaziantep, Adana, Ankara, all the way to Istanbul. We're engaging and linking with them to create awareness for UK opportunities for their members and also linking UK business networks with these chambers so we can create more business for everyone. Our aim is ultimately to create an ecosystem that brings everybody together and creates direct links between these many networks.</p><h4>Which sectors do you think represent the highest potential for UK-Turkish cooperation?</h4><p>The sectors we prioritize in the UK are energy, infrastructure, design, health, education, innovation, aerospace, and increasingly agriculture, where we have a lot of technology in the agro-innovation sector. Turkey needs both investment and technological capabilities to develop self-sustainable energy production, especially with all the big infrastructure projects driving up demand. We can complement Turkey's strengths in areas like civil engineering and construction. UK companies are  involved in the third Bosphorus bridge and third airport projects for Istanbul, for example, on both the design and technology side. In healthcare we have in depth experience in PPPs, which is also a focus for UK companies in Turkey. In education, there's a shortage of English-language teaching in state schools and there's a demand for more UK educational institutions providing examination and the UK education system in higher education. Turkey's HR ability is growing, and it has a very well educated workforce. Turkey is today an exporter of executives, considering the number of Turkish executives that run companies around the world. So Turkey will want to further strengthen its educational capabilities, and we feel that the UK can help provide that. In terms of R&amp;D, there are also big opportunities. Turkey lacks a solid R&amp;D platform in various sectors, like pharmaceuticals, and even in white goods. We can help with that. Arçelik/Beko just signed an agreement with Cambridge University to set up an R&amp;D facility that would develop a next generation of white goods and home electronics. In terms of defense and aerospace industry, Turkey is still a critical country geo-strategically, and it has to have good defense capabilities and it has to be stable and strong, and it has to be an economic driver for the region and the link to other emerging markets around the area and beyond. In general, Turkey's ascent to move from an emerging market to a developed market is creating a wealth of opportunities. Turkey has a strong manufacturing capability and capacity, producing products for other companies and other brands, but it doesn't have international brands itself. The country wants to change that and move up the value chain, and this is creating opportunities in a wide variety of sectors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1957, Bukhamseen Group Holding is one of the largest financial and industrial companies in Kuwait today. What is your primary vision for the company?</h4><p>Our vision is to continue what we are doing in a more diversified way. When we started the family business and entered into a sector, our goal was to establish a business, find the right management, be profitable, then move to another sector and do the same thing. Our diversified model has allowed us to survive all the hiccups in the market. We concentrate heavily on the companies we have in various sectors to make them leaders in their fields.</p><h4>How would you evaluate Bukhamseen Group Holding's performance in 2014 and into 2015?</h4><p>We hope that every year will be a better year. In 2014, we were successful in completing the strategy we had implemented in 2008 following the crisis. In order to make the company more resilient going forward in the face of market shocks, we refocused on our core businesses, on liquidity, and on completing projects or restructuring where needed. Moving into 2015 we have a new strategy focused on growth in our investments.</p><h4>What do you identify as being the most profitable investments for Bukhamseen Holding?</h4><p>We are increasing our shares in several banks around the region. Additionally, consumer industries and industries based on day-to-day demand offer great opportunities: water, juice, and food industries, and on the manufacturing and production side, steel, because it is involved in construction and this region is full of new developments. Ultimately, we evaluate every business and every investment we have. We try to invest only in higher-yielding and fast-growing businesses. We avoid attachment to low-yielding investments in order to find more profitable ones, making sure that we are capable of handling rapid change.</p><h4>How has Kuwait's economy developed over the years, and what role does it play in the region today?</h4><p>Historically Kuwait has been a center for trade. It is surrounded by big, oil-rich countries—Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Business was created in Kuwait based on merchant trade. After the war between Iraq and Iran and the invasion of Kuwait, families and businesses concentrated on investing in real estate and establishing industries. At the same time, following a phase of legal reform, the banking and insurance sector were supported and businesses and institutions grew stronger. Kuwait has always been very active in ensuring a stable region and is the first to donate toward any crisis. There was an immediate response when Kuwait was invaded. This is a humanitarian country with many charitable institutions, such as the Kuwait Foundation, which finances and builds infrastructure in the region through lending low-interest, long-term loans.</p><h4>With this background in mind, how do you envision Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>The more the countries around us are stabilized, the better Kuwait's ability will be to become a future trade center. Regardless of the oil prices today, the government will continue spending, enhance the private sector, and support investment going forward. All sectors will do well if the government maintains what they are doing. This will encourage the private sector and oil sectors toward further investment.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for growth beyond Kuwait?</h4><p>Bukhamseen is looking to Iraq—a country rich in people and resources. New laws for direct investment in Iraq are encouraging. In 20 years' time, Iraq will be doing well; we see that in trade already. Considering recent events, Egypt is also doing well. Oman, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia are also key growth areas for us.</p><h4>Are you searching for business partners in these areas?</h4><p>We often directly invest in companies close to Kuwait who approach us, though we are not so eager to directly invest farther away. It makes a lot of sense to directly invest and gain experience and time in this region. We are investing also in Europe and the US, but always through third parties.</p><h4>Over the past 50 years, Bukhamseen has seen steady expansion of its businesses. Looking to the next three to five years, what does the future of Bukhamseen Holding look like?</h4><p>Bukhamseen is concentrating on two things: policies and procedures. We are in the second generation now going on to the third, and we want to continue without any disturbances. We are also developing our product offering. At the same time, from the other side, we want to increase efficiency and make the business stronger and more competitive. We are trying to have fewer loans and decrease our liabilities. Decreasing debt and increasing profitability in all sectors is our main focus. In preparation for future challenges, we are building our resiliency. We are already diversified.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Bukhamseen Holding in 2016?</h4><p>Looking forward, we are less focused on diversifying, and concentrating on increasing our competitiveness in the sectors we are already in. We are supporting our current businesses' efforts to be more efficient and encouraging management to decrease liabilities. Our initiatives are aimed at minimizing risk while increasing profitability. We have waited until the conditions were right to take this approach, and we continue to hope for sustained stability in Kuwait.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide a background on the company?</h4><p>Quality Yachts is over 25 years old, and specialized in the sales and maintenance of yachts in the Venezuelan, Colombian, and Panamanian markets. We have been in Panama for three years, representing brands such as Ferretti Group, Riva, and Pershing. Considering the crisis Europe is going through, Ferretti Group has been focusing more on North, Central, and South America. We opened an office and official dealership in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and we base our maintenance and services of Ferretti products there, while in terms of sales we continue to work directly with the Ferretti factory in Italy. We offer A-Class products, which is a European classification indicating that a boat has the best characteristics and equipment possible, in terms of design, technical specifications, and engine. Therefore, working with brands like Ferretti has enabled us to surpass any other dealer in this field in Panama. We also represent US brands such as Scout, Formula, and Chaparral. There has been a major investment in marines in Panama over the last three years, something that has been lacking until now; however, the yacht sector continues to grow, and we are well positioned with our focus on sales and maintenance. </p><h4>The government continues to invest in infrastructure, which means greater growth potential, but also more competition. What is your competitive advantage?</h4><p>There is still a lack of marine facilities and sport sailing brands in Panama. However, Panama is a natural market for this, due to its coastline on two oceans, and, of course, the Panama Canal; therefore, there is huge potential and possibility here. Still, there are no marinas for pleasure sailing and sports yachting. The government needs to incentivize the construction and use of new marinas, whether public or private, to meet this need. This will doubtless increase business for companies such as ours. More people will be able to buy a yacht, because they will have a place to keep and use it, and those yachts will all need regular maintenance. It was a good year in 2013, where we sold $15 million worth of boats in Panama alone. We aim to continue growing and expanding in sales, but especially in maintenance. Overall, 2014 was a stable year in terms of maintenance and most of the growth we saw was through customers who already had boats and needed maintenance and repairs. Sales are on another upward trajectory, although maintenance and service remains the stronger part of our business, which we can undertake for any and all types of yacht, be they American or European. We invest around $800,000 annually in our business, training our staff, and acquiring new equipment and technologies. </p><h4>Is there much demand for used yachts?</h4><p>It is a small market. The used yacht market today is large in the US and Europe, where new yacht sales have dipped sharply due to the economic situation there. However, here in Panama, the resale market is limited. Most of that is trading anyway, someone wanting to trade a boat in for a newer or larger yacht. </p><h4>What is your consolidation strategy for Panama?</h4><p>We have invested heavily in our maintenance services, because our primary market positioning is in maintenance and repairs rather than sales. We have the utmost faith in Panama, which is why we are present. Our clients trust in us and rely on us, and we want to sustain that and even build on it. Our clients know that we can replace their boat, or sell them a new vessel, and maintain, repair, and take care of that one. We are essentially investing in our reputation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the years to become one of the main institutions in the sector?</h4><p>We founded Ben Betesh in 1959. That is 55 years ago, and later we started doing business with Europe. In this time we were selling yard wool and making suits and custom made trousers. After that we started bringing ready made wear to Panama. We started in 1968 with Lacoste and then we introduced Marks &amp; Spencer. We worked with them for 32 years, from 1968 to 2000. We represent Lacoste in Mexico and in all Latin America, except for Mercosur. The company has been growing significantly since 2000-2001. We have a solid infrastructure in Mexico, where we own 22 shops, and we have infrastructure in Peru, Lima, with 10 shops, two Lacoste and eight Crocs. We are very keen in retail, as that is our specialty.  </p><h4>How would you assess the status of the retail sector in Panama today? </h4><p>The sector has a lot of potential, but we are facing some challenges. The new government has not defined any policies, and we are in limbo now with no direction. Moreover, the entire Latin American region has some problems: devaluation, recession, and a high tax on imports are having a strong impact on the Panamanian economy. Panama provides services to all of Latin America. In the Colón Free Zone, sales have been down by about 35%. This is a friendly zone, and a lot of the businesses closed. In Colombia, which is the best customer for Panama, they raised the duty on textiles, in shoes. The situation in Venezuela is not good, as the country owes Panama $800 million. Peru is stable, and Chile is an exception, as it is the only country in South America that is safe now. Brazil is complicated, as it is very hard to do business there right now. Ultimately, the market in Central America is limited. </p><h4>How do you intend to capitalize on the planned expansion of the Tocumen Airport?</h4><p>We have been in the airport for 50 years. The new airport is coming in 2018. There will be a new area, and we will be there. There is about 3,000 or 4,000 square meters for commercial development. Lufthansa is coming in November, connecting Frankfurt to Panama. We already have KLM, Air France, and Iberia, and Copa has been growing fast. Panama has turned into the shopping center for Latin America. Last year, the sector slowed, and the number of tourists declined. We have tourists, but with limited tourism budgets. Before, people would come and shop with up to $4,000, but not anymore. And at the same time, at the airport, our sales declined in conjunction with less traffic. In 2013, 13 million passengers come through the airport, and in 2014, we had between 12 million and 13 million. And this year is going to be a bit slow. The visitors to the airport are internationals, familiar with international brands such as Lacoste, Bally, Harmont, Blaine, and Crocs. But for Latin Americans, because of the currency devaluation, these products have become prohibitively expensive. To give some context, the Colombian peso has devalued against the dollar by 35% or more, while Peru experienced 20% devaluation. In 2014 and 2013, we attracted considerable Brazilian clientele when their currency was at 170 to the dollar—today its 320. The knock-on effects for Panama are clear. This is due to the devaluation.</p><h4>Where do you plan to consolidate your presence?</h4><p>Colombia is one of our targets, and Peru is another one. Ecuador is hard to do business in. In Central America, we have businesses in Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Mexico is another key market. We have a joint venture there with Lacoste as well as with another partner. We enjoy good relations with all the department stores, which is the main business generator in Mexico. Meanwhile, we have several new brands in Mexico: Harmont &amp; Blaine, Scotch and Soda, and John Varvatos. We also plan to expand to Chile, and are currently looking for a partner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved over the years?</h4><p>My father set up his first shop in 1948 and from that time he established a shopping culture based on a family-oriented atmosphere, providing excellent customer service, and considerate treatment to employees, who are called associates in our company. Over the years, his children became involved in the family business. We were national pioneers in establishing shopping malls after the period of dictatorship, which was around 1992. We have helped foreign brands invest in Panama, which has in turn made us highly competitive. We have become a very reputable partner, and currently also operate in the Colón Free Trade Zone, what enables us to be a regional power in the sector.</p><h4>What is the importance of Colón Free Trade Zones for Panama to consolidate its regional leadership?</h4><p>Panama has been rapidly developing in the last decade and Colón Free Trade Zone represents Panama's retail base and it is the second most important FTZ in the world after Hong Kong. In terms of costs, Panama offers unbeatable conditions at the international level. On top of that, the great efforts from Copa Airlines to connect Panama to the world and the role of the Panama Canal, including its recent expansion, have consolidated this country as a regional and international hub.</p><h4>How would you assess the state of development of Panama's retail industry?</h4><p>There are not many department stores, as we own 30% of the department stores available in the market. This is one of our main advantages; we operate in a limited sector with many small-scale players. Many years of experience, volume and competitive prices are our main advantages. We also know the market very well, having grown through many stages of national development. In general, Panama is a country of opportunities. Since 2006, it has grown at an annual average rate of 8.9%. Panama is a stable nation from a financial perspective and its growth, despite slightly slowing down, will continue in the next few years.<br>What regions of the country are you considering expansion into?<br>Until a few years ago, growth of the retail sector mainly happened in Panama City; however, we have luckily seen this expanding to other cities and regions, as we saw the construction of several shopping malls across the country. At the moment, we have 11 stores in Panama City and the rest are nationwide. Regarding a potential international expansion of our activities, we do not have such plans over the short to medium-term.</p><h4>What is your target audience?</h4><p>Our target goes from low-end to medium-high segments. High-end brands are not part of our business strategy. Our main strategy is to offer competitive prices, and we are always open to listen to potential suppliers. We have suppliers in Asia, Brazil, the US, Mexico, among others.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2015?</h4><p>Over the past decade, our company has been growing at an annual average rate of 12%. We expect to close 2015 with on 5-7% growth due to the maturity of the country and sector. In terms of store number, we will have reached 18 by year-end. Each of these stores has an area of between 8,000sqm and 10,000sqm. In 2015, we have opened two new stores and one more is on the way, which will open by the end of the year.  Our  plans include increasing by two to three new stores every year. Therefore, our main target is to sustain the growth of our operations with new stores, while continuing to upgrade technological systems and innovation. We are also in a transition as we hand over management responsibilities to other players in the company, in order to further broaden our horizons in the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Thanks to the Cumbre, Panama has been able to gather the global community to discuss the latest trends and the future related to the economic development of the Americas. What was the importance of this event to consolidate and promote the image of the country globally?</h4><p>The Summit of the Americas was very important for the economic and political perspectives of Panama as it positioned our country as a hemispheric leader in the development of global dialogue. The main event and the additional economic and civil society forums created the perfect atmosphere towards the enforcement of relationships with the main players of different industries and governments, hence increasing awareness about Panamas business opportunities and collaboration processes. €¨</p><h4>How is the government working to enhance the level of connectivity of the country, both domestically and internationally?</h4><p>We are currently undergoing different strategies to bring more players in the airline and shipping industries to use Panamas logistic and transportation hub. There is a lot of interest from companies around the world to help Panama improve its connectivity. One of the strategies is to fulfill the development of co-op funds with airlines, which also helps to promote our country as a tourism destination worldwide. </p><h4>According to ProInvex, Ecotourism is predicted to grow almost 20% per year overy year in the short term. What is your strategy to foster the growth of this segment even further?</h4><p>Panama is one of the least known jewels of the world. Our natural treasures have been hidden from the public view for years. The Panama Tourism Authority is currently developing ecotourism products to bring more people to visit our natural rainforest reserves, which comprise around 30% of the territory of the whole country. This is one of the highest percentages of natural reserves in proportion to its territory of any country in the region. On the other hand, we are the only country in the world with a Biodiversity Museum. The museum tells the story, but the real museum is out in the rainforest and it is very alive.<br>€¨<br>What kind of incentives is the current government promoting to attract more FDI to the sector?<br>The Law 80, which regulates the incentives for tourism companies, gives tax benefits to companies interested in developing tourism in Panama. Land and income tax exoneration are some of the benefits which are stipulated as incentives.€¨€¨</p><h4>What is the current status of the MICE industry in Panama and what potential does this segment offer for the development of Panamas tourism industry?</h4><p>MICE is a very important segment for Panama, due to the fact that Panama City has great hotel properties and event halls to offer to event planners. As a matter of fact, Panama has been ranked recently as one of the destinations with highest expectations of growth for the MICE segment. In the Panama Tourism Authority, we have a department exclusively dedicated to promote Panama as a MICE destination.</p><h4>Can you share with us the Ministrys priorities for 2015?</h4><p>The Ministry's top priorities for the year are to increase regional and global connectivity, improve awareness about the benefits and attractions of the destination, to develop more tourism attractions and products, to position Panama as a place where there is always something happening, whether it is concerts, festivals, artistic performances, and lastly, to increase direct foreign investment in tourism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company developed since its foundation?</h4><p>My father founded our company in 1974. He started selling office, home and pharmacy related products. In 1978, he started a paper converter factory that focused on paper products such as copy paper, stationary, file folders, etc.  With that, our focus shifted solely to office equipment, supplies, and paper products.   </p><h4>Is your sector characterized by high competition?</h4><p>It is a competitive market because there are many products entering from China, and with the free zone importing products margins have become tight. One of the main markets we sell to is home businesses which are in daily need of our services. We send eight or nine drivers with around 40 invoices to be delivered. Each Monday we deliver to a company in Santiago where we have a store that is a subsidiary of our company.</p><h4>What competitive advantages have allowed your company to survive and succeed in this competitive environment?</h4><p>Our high quality of service has really given us a competitive edge over our competition, because even if our competitors have similar products, nothing will match our quality of service. Globalization allows access to many offers, but our service speaks for itself. If a company has a deadline or needs technical support, we are there to help.</p><h4>Do you anticipate online sales posing a challenge to your business?</h4><p>People still like to talk to another human being when they call up a business and want to conduct a transaction, not a machine. We want to provide a more personalized experience for our customers, and the relationships we build survive the test of time.  We have customers who come to us on a daily basis, and their loyalty is reassuring.</p><h4>How do you establish relations with suppliers to expand your product portfolio?</h4><p>We travel extensively to attend shows, exhibitions and conferences. We currently have a group going to China to attend a show.  We maintain strong relationships with our suppliers.  People crave relationships, and our network has proven that our business goes beyond the products and helps bring people together.</p><h4>What is the importance of CSR for the company?</h4><p>Our company is committed to social development. We recently supported a government project to help people in the interior of the country. Specifically, we participated in the construction of wells that work with solar energy to help people receive water for their crops and homes.  These have had a huge impact on people's lives. We also have a large line in school supplies, which is an area that expanded from selling paper and printers to selling supplies designed for students and for children with special needs. There was a huge need for everything regarding education in Panama.</p><h4>Which of your products are driving growth today?</h4><p>The paper segment is driving growth, as most people have a computer and printer in their homes. Even though we encourage green industry, we recognize that people still need to print.  Solar panels are also a growing segment, although the mentality with regard to renewable energy has been difficult to change at times. We see it as an opportunity for educating people on sustainability. The government is interested in improving the ecosystem and cleaning up industry to make it more efficient and sustainable. The stationary market is stable, and wide format printers have become popular. </p><h4>What are your company's goals for the end of 2015?</h4><p>We are working on major projects involving solar panels, which has become a key focus for us. In terms of technology we are working on a project to become streamlined and modernized. Another project that is close to my heart is the development of products for children with special needs. Panama is not a convenient country for people with special needs, and the mindset is not what it should be. We are trying to break certain habits that are not considerate of these children and adults.  Everyone has the right to receive a better education and therefore have a better life.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the current level of access to higher education in Panama?</h4><p>From 1935 until the early 1980s there was very little in the way of higher education in our country. The 1990s marked an unprecedented boom in private universities, which currently number about 25. Universities have developed regional headquarters, and even special programs to provide access for indigenous and rural areas using information and communications technology. Tuition information recorded by the General Controller Office indicated in the last census showed that 139,116 people from rural and indigenous areas were pursuing higher education studies. Regarding graduates, we recorded more than 21,821 people from different professions serving the development of the country. Studies indicate that there is a shortage of at least 75,000 trained professionals in different sectors and this is an opportunity for education institutions.</p><h4>What have been the landmark achievements of Columbus University?</h4><p>We have increased and diversified the number of degrees, introducing not only more campus offerings, but also extending our learning with the support of information and communication technologies. We expanded our offering of post-graduate programs, courses, seminars and diplomas, and prepared also some PhD offerings in partnership with prestigious American and European universities. We have than 4,000 graduates who contribute in different areas of the development of the country such as in the maritime sector, where we teach Naval Engineering with an specialization in Machinery and Maritime Transportation. We also have graduated doctors, lawyers, and business managers who specialize in education, architecture, law, psychology and other important economic and social development areas. We boosted participation in academic networks with national and international universities for the academic development of teaching, student mobility and research. We built closer links with the private sector, state institutions and civil society to strengthen the curriculum of the teaching offered. We strengthened participation in national and regional organizations of higher education such CRP, AUPPA, and AUPRICA among others. We developed research activities and pushed for continuous improvement of the capabilities and skills of our teachers and students in areas of extension, technology and academic teaching and research.</p><h4>Can you talk about the latest programs the university has integrated in its offerings to strengthen competitiveness levels?</h4><p>We are always improving out academic offerings and developing new courses and programs to meet the demands and needs of the growth of the economy. We incorporated nine new compulsory levels of English language to all degrees, so we will soon become a fully bilingual university. We incorporated ICT, virtual libraries, and degree simulators for medical and nautical engineering, computer labs and social networks. We developed blended programs to facilitate the access to higher education to people and communities with that have difficulty attending lessons. </p><h4>How does the university offer opportunities to foreign students? What kinds of joint projects have you developed at the international level?</h4><p>We have the international recognition of; the World Confederation of Businesses based in Texas, USA; Ibero-American Council for Quality Education, based in Lima, Peru; the Association of Private Universities of Central America and Panama, based in San Jose, Costa Rica; the International Organization of Universities for Sustainable Development and Environment (OIUDSMA), based in Granada, Spain; the Brazilian Association of Quality Incentive, based in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Importantly, Columbus University possesses ISO 9001 version 2008 standards and we have the accreditation of the National Assessment and Accreditation Institution of Panama. In addition, the School of Marine Science and Technology Center is certified as Maritime Training Center by the Panama Maritime Authority and belongs to the University Network that integrates the Compostela Group Universities based in Santiago de Compostela, Spain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Education was one of the top priorities of the recent Summit of the Americas. How would you assess the results achieved during this international event?</h4><p>Equity and prosperity were the main themes of the summit, and to achieve either, education is vital. A common region-wide education agenda was established at the Summit. The agenda prioritizes the continued further education of professors and teachers, improvements in early-years education (0-3 years old), capacity building in science, math and technology curricula and increasing the quality and inclusiveness of education. It is hoped that these steps will develop talent and build innovation and creativity into our young. In Panama, we are planning to invest in a number of technological colleges, in order to develop the technical skills of engineers and technicians. Our region-wide agenda was presented to the presidents of the respective states, and it was agreed that regional-cooperation through common programs and projects would set the educational milieu in the coming years. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the current status of the education sector in Panama?</h4><p>President Juan Carlos Varela has outlined that education should be a government priority. The targets and goals we have are very specific. First, we want to increase the number of preschool aged children in education. We also want to increase the intermediary attendance rate. Currently, more than a third of high school age students leave before completion, unprepared for the work force. In both cases, one of the strategies is to increase the number of schools. We also want to increase the number of in-school hours from 5 to 6, or 7. Another challenge we have is giving our students who finish high school other opportunities aside from university to be successful in life. That is where our plan to invest in technological institutes comes into play. </p><h4>What is the importance of creating a strong synergy between higher education and the labor market to stimulate entrepreneurial skills among Panamanian students?</h4><p>Our Ministry and the Ministry of Labor have a number of joint projects in place. For example, the ENADE, which is our institute for informal training. We also collaborate with technological colleges and universities in order to develop strategies to meet the requirements of the labor market. We are looking into models to follow, such as the technical institutes in Singapore. 70% of the curricula will be technical and practical and the other 30% will be personal and life skills. The institutes will teach in both Spanish and English, and prepare students to find a well-paying job. It is hoped that it will be no longer necessary for companies to source talent from abroad, as the Panamanian workforce becomes competent across a wide range of highly skilled roles. </p><h4>What is the Ministry of Education's strategy to introduce a bilingual education system in Panama?</h4><p>A complete, bilingual system will take 12 years to be fully set in place in the country. We are planning to change the elementary school curriculum, with some classes in English and others in Spanish. We plan to do this is by preparing our elementary school teachers to become bilingual. We will have a one-year training program in English for our teachers. We expect to start the program by 2016 in private schools where it is hoped that 1,800 teaching staff will register for the program. We also have an immersion program for professors of English. It is important to us to improve English language skills across all levels of education. </p><h4>What are the key objectives that you would like to achieve by the end of 2015?</h4><p>Maintaining the infrastructure of our institutions, increasing in-school hours, and investment in technical institutes and the bilingual skills of our students are the government priorities for education in 2015. We hope to see the first technical institute and the bilingual pilot schools up and running by the end of this year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the real estate and construction sector in Panama?</h4><p>The real estate sector has great potential with plenty of opportunities for investors. The development of this industry goes hand-in-hand with the development of the country. Panama's GDP is currently around $50 billion. In a decade, the country has managed to quadruple its GDP. The state has managed to modernize itself over the last decade, becoming a regional power in all senses. Panama is on its way to becoming a developed country—income per capita currently stands at more than $12,000. Average growth rate is between 5% and 6%. These figures have attracted a huge amount of investment in the real estate and construction sector. There is increased access to the housing market for both Panamanians and foreign investors. Demand in the housing market has grown at a very fast pace in the last ten years and the sector had to catch up to meet this demand. </p><h4>How does Green Valley symbolize the attractiveness of Panama and the real estate sector for foreign investors with the projects you are currently developing?</h4><p>Green Valley is a majestic project, and among the largest of its kind in the world. It represents the most promising and innovative urban development in Latin America—almost 200 ha of development that reinvents the Eco-City concept. This kind of project is only viable in a country with the characteristics of Panama; fast development, real estate opportunities and qualitative land available. The location of the project is truly unique—you can see Panama's bay from the mountain. The location is quite privileged too similar to cities such as LA and San Francisco. The nearby Valley compliments the area with fauna and diversity.</p><h4>What stage of development is the project in?</h4><p>We started sales activities some two years ago; however, construction works started in January 2014. By the end of 2016, we will enter the second stage and complete up to stage four and by summer of 2017, stage five will also be completed. This means that in less than two years, 70% of the project will be completed. At the moment, we are building parts of the cities, mainly streets. </p><h4>What is the importance of applying the best international standards to such project?</h4><p>This project will set the pace for other future developments in the country as well as the region. We see opportunities for developing similar projects in Colombia and Venezuela. Success in Panama will be the cornerstone for future development of the region and for this purpose international standards are a must. One of the advantages of Green Valley is the fact that we developed a small city from scratch, a difficult task in developed countries. We also apply the latest technologies and the best international standards to all our developments in the city. Eco-City has a potential for projects worth $6 billion in total.</p><h4>What is the potential of Green Valley as a platform to attract foreign investment in the commercial sector? </h4><p>The city is located in a key strategic area, in Panama Norte with two direct accesses to Corridor Norte. This is something we planned from the very beginning of the development of this city. On top of that, the city will have the capability to host 100,000 people. This means that there are areas for educational, health and industrial/commercial projects. In total, the city has over 500,000 square meters of RM3 land. We believe the city can host 300 skyscrapers.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you brief us on the evolution of IVF in Panama?</h4><p>IVF (in vitro fertilization) in Panama is evolving rapidly, and my center IVF Panama is probably one of the key such institutions in Central America. Not all clinics in Central America offer In Vitro or medical reproduction services. For example in Costa Rica, IVF is prohibited by law. In Guatemala, there are a small number of centers. IVF technologies have been offered and are available to patients in Panama for over 15 years. I opened the doors to my IVF center 13 years ago, in 2002. Since then I have dedicated myself to continuously improving my IVF laboratory with the best technologies available. I have made huge investments to provide my embryologist with the newest technologies to work with. I feel that is what makes my center stand out from the rest. IVF Panama is not alone in providing excellent patient care, but we offer hope to patients with technologies that not every clinic offers. Another key element that I am proud of is my well-trained professional team, vital to a successful IVF laboratory. My embryologists were the first in the country to be trained in the cryopreservation method of Vitrification. We were also one of the first IVF laboratories to offer PGD (Pre Genetic Diagnosis), which is the ability to diagnose an embryo with chromosome abnormalities and inform a patient prior to the embryo transfer taking place. Now available is the newest technology called PGS, which is a 46 chromosome screening done under CGH (comparative genomic hybridization). Endometrial receptivity of the endometrium, is the newest reproductive technique we are offering. This test has given us a great response with patients and successful outcomes. IVF Panama is having a great year with outstanding results, and is continuously increasing cycles. Due to this, IVF Panama has become an attractive clinic in other areas of the world such as United States, South America and Canada. Medical tourism has really taken off, and we are proud to be a part of it. Our continuous efforts to excel and provide an above-average service has put IVF Panama on the map for others to seek interest with international organizations and universities to collaborate in studies and research on new IVF technologies.</p><h4>What will be the future of medical tourism here in Panama and how are you positioned to capitalize on the inflow of patients?</h4><p>Taking care of international patients is one of our goals, and is something that has been working for us with currently around 30% of our patients coming from abroad. The internet plays a pivotal role in the development of medical tourism in Panama. People search for treatment online, and our certifications are an important reference for the quality of our care provision. People come to our center and obtain good results, which is a source of referrals. We have been working on medical tourism for the past six or seven years, and are in a strong position. </p><h4>Some 30% of patients are international. Which areas are you targeting to increase this percentage?</h4><p>We are shifting into IVF. Online research confirms just how many people are trying to find IVF centers. There are countries that do not cover IVF as a part of their insurance policies and so on, whereby patients pay out of pocket. People try to look for the best fees for IVF Treatment, and once you have a good quality center at an affordable price—our prices are one-third of those in the US. At the end of the day, we might be more expensive than some countries and cheaper than others, but we are in a good market.</p><h4>Can you share details related to your efforts to establish connections with international institutions to consolidate your activities and your image as well? </h4><p>We have been in contact with prestigious companies that are recognized worldwide. These companies are helping women suffering from reproductive failure, and giving new hope to patients by improving the quality of eggs. We are now going to be the first in Panama to launch treatments to improve the health of eggs. Children in Canada have already been born with the help of this procedure, and there are other patients who have achieved pregnancy in other countries, which is something that is very promising for women who are older or have low quality eggs. We were the only institution selected to undertake this procedure in Latin America, so it is greatly encouraging that the international community is recognizing the quality of our patient services.</p><h4>What are the main targets that you intend to achieve by the end of this year?</h4><p>By the end of this year, I seek to double the number of IVF cycles undertaken and position the center as one of the biggest in Latin America. With the new business to be developed and the new income that this will generate, we will try to reinvest to obtain much better technology to improve the center still further.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We have a population of around four million people and the domestic real estate market is still much smaller than its economic potential. The construction sector in Panama is growing on the back of large projects; however, our challenge has to do with planning better urban development and having a longer-term vision. Our capital, for example, is currently congested with traffic, necessitating several projects such as the metro line, urban reorganization, and the development of suburban cities. We want to divert congestion and traffic away from the capital. Over the past few years there have been important retail, commercial and housing projects. For example, we have developed several social housing projects and provided economic support to people with less economic means. </p><h4>What is Panama's current housing deficit?</h4><p>When we took over, the housing deficit was 142,000 units. These numbers represent a cruel reality, namely that housing was not a priority for previous administrations. In stark contrast, we have made social housing a top priority. The Ministry has duly developed several programs to give access to housing and build new units. For example, in 2015 the Ministry is set to tender and build 15,000 new housing units.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the development plans the government has for Colón?</h4><p>Colón is located at the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal. The reality is that Panama City is a developing city that attracts people and investment. Colón, however, has been left behind and has lacked investment in infrastructure, both socially and economically. Commercially speaking however, Colón is the second most important city in Panama, and in terms of population, the third. It needs a clear push for development. Housing programs and investment in infrastructure are at the heart of our efforts to develop the city. We will build 5,000 new housing units in the short-term. This will be accompanied by recreation and sport infrastructure. We will also invest in public service infrastructure such as water, electric energy infrastructure, and the like. Colón is a city with a long history that has been forgotten by other administrations for many years. The city has lost its attractiveness, but we want to transform the city into a tourism destination for both national and foreign tourists. For example, we will improve road infrastructure networks in and out of the city. This city has potential and we want to modernize the city and take action, for there are areas in the city that face desperate situations. </p><h4>What other areas of the country are included in the Ministry's top priorities for the next few years?</h4><p>The government's “Roof of Hope“ program initiated action with the expectation of helping 5,000 families gain access to housing every year. The program also works on securing drinking water and other basic services, and reducing the housing deficit by targeting the most vulnerable communities of the country. By December 2014, as many as 3,600 families had benefited from this program. This was only few months after setting up the project. We also developed programs to secure the reintegration of former gang leaders and members into society. Overall, our top priority areas are those for high risk and vulnerable communities. </p><h4>What are your main goals for 2015?</h4><p>Among our goals are getting the urban reorganization project tendered and approved, so we can start construction. The Ministry wants to reach all 5,000 families in 2015 within the “Roofs of hope“ program, and 10,000 by 2016. We also want to continue the tendering process for the construction of 12,000 housing units across the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Ministry's vision for developing the agricultural sector in Panama? </h4><p>Our vision for the development of the agricultural sector in Panama is to focus on designing a developmental strategy that does not remain static but rather evolves over time in a way that will benefit the entire agricultural value chain. But our most important mission is to ensure the production of top quality affordable food for our population through humanitarian measures that utilize partnerships between the public sector and subsistence farmers, along with various institutions including family farms, schools, and participation projects for regional development.  </p><h4>Where do you see the greatest investment and growth potential in the Panamanian agricultural sector?</h4><p>We see the greatest potential in agro-exports, particularly for crops such as pineapples, melons, watermelons, papaya, and squash. These products have extensive markets available to them in both Europe and North America. Every region in Panama has its own particular climatic conditions and therefore specializes in different kinds of crops. </p><h4>A significant part of the national population lives in the capital city and other major cities. What is your strategy to stimulate the sector while also minimizing internal migration from rural areas to urban centers? </h4><p>The most important task before us is to increase agricultural education while also convincing and incentivizing young people in rural areas to pursue a career in the agricultural sector without abandoning their fields and farms, and without feeling the need to emigrate to cities. With this objective in mind, we've apportioned $22 million in funds to invest in the Instituto Agropecuario de Panamá (INA), which has campuses in all major provincial centers. Another strategy we are undertaking is the provision of direct support to producers so that they don't abandon their lands. We're also making strides in terms of our Public-Private pact to reforest a million hectares of land throughout the country over the next 20 years, working closely with conservation agencies and national organizations and associations. </p><h4>What are your main aims, objectives and goals for 2015? </h4><p>The task of re-energizing and rejuvenating the agricultural sector in Panama has been slow and difficult, but we feel that by the end of 2015, we'll have rescued and revitalized our agricultural institutions while also having developed new projects in the process, giving confidence to producers in the sector that the national government is their friend and their ally. For both 2015 and the years to follow, we envision a dynamic agricultural sector that has renewed impetus and greater production volumes in all scales. </p><h4>Sustained agricultural development is almost impossible without introducing new technologies to the sector. How much is being invested in new technologies, and where are the new investment opportunities coming from?  </h4><p>We can no longer base our agriculture on chance, hoping for rain. All our agricultural lands should have 100% access to irrigation and watering systems in the coming years. At the same time, IDIAP (the Institute for Agricultural Investigation in Panama) has been developing new seeding and sowing methods for various crops. The investment is still in its early stages, but the project is set to pick up pace in the coming years. </p><h4>How attractive do you think Panama is for foreign investors? What is your plan for attracting more investment into the Panamanian agricultural sector? </h4><p>One of the primary objectives of this new administration is to open new horizons and markets, because we know that Panamanian products and producers meet the high standards required by international consumers. Our products comply with the most stringent hygiene standards, and we have made great efforts to increase and strengthen our production of innocuous foods, in line with our dedication to the insecurity needs and expectations of the Panamanian population. This all demonstrates the great capacity that Panama has, not only in terms of excellent services, but also in terms of producing and exporting products of the highest quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Meet The Supply]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[meet-the-supply]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the state of real estate and construction in Panama today?</h4><p>Real estate and construction in Panama is still doing well in general, especially regarding residential projects in Panama City and the suburbs, from low income housing to high-end residential apartments and houses. Right now we are managing a few residential projects in Santa Maria, with sale prices between $500,000 to $1.5 million and these are selling well. We are also managing residential and commercial projects to the west of the capital in Costa Verde, Chorrera, and they are also doing well. Beach resort developments have slowed down a little after a period of high demand on lots, houses/villas and apartments over the last three years. This is probably because of a slowdown in the economy (from 10% to 6% GDP growth) and the change of government last year.  There is high demand on beach resort developments the supply of residential units has increased.  When I started working with Buenaventura in 2001, there were only a few beach resort projects. The last time I counted the beach developments and standalone projects, there were more than 40, so I believe the developments that are above and beyond the competition in terms of amenities and services will do better than basic projects. </p><h4>How did Mar Azul start its operations in the market?</h4><p>When we were finishing the Bristol Buenaventura (now a JW Marriott Hotel) back in 2009, I suggested to the owner that I wanted to open a Project Management firm to manage some of the projects for their group (Grupo Verde Azul “GVA") and he encouraged me to do so. At the end of 2009 we started managing the projects of GVA in Buenaventura (Paseo de las Casas, Club Estate and Puntarena) and the construction of the expansion of Bristol Hotel Panama. After a few years of managing projects exclusively of GVA, we began managing projects from other developers.  Today we manage over 10 large projects (hotel, commercial and residential) for nine real estate developers.</p><h4>Is the government implementing policies to control the development of beach resorts?</h4><p>In order to keep development on course, the government must invest a lot in infrastructure and education. Right now, there are areas with no water infrastructure, so the development depends on water wells and the area with water infrastructure. There is not enough water to supply the demand needed during peak season, so the development has to rely on large water tanks or water wells during peak hours of consumption. Additionally the government has to invest in education in order to increase the number and quality of skilled labor for the construction and hospitality industries.  A good portion of the jobs are filled with workers from Panama City or major towns nearby instead of small towns close to the development. We have talked with the government about these issues, but they have not done much about it, as they are long-term investments. At the same time, they are not doing anything to regulate growth or improve current infrastructure. We need the government to help us with basic infrastructure in order to keep developing at the beaches.</p><h4>Can you talk about your consolidation and expansion strategy?</h4><p>Right now, we are only focusing on Panama. Expanding the firm to Colombia and Costa Rica is something I know that we need to do. Diversifying in terms of the services we offer is another priority, as currently we are more focused on residential, commercial, and hospitality, and I would like to expand into major infrastructure or energy projects. I would also like to take on some projects with the ports at the Canal and in public sector. I cannot rely solely on residential projects, especially as I'm more exposed to the high-end residential sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess Panama's latest progress in the health sector?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VILMA MORENO DE ARIAS</strong> Over recent years the country has been characterized by real progress, and it is evident that Panama is growing in the healthcare sector too. Indeed, Panama is trying to turn into a hub for healthcare services for regional headquarters, expatriates, investors and companies operating in the country. In 2015, we celebrate 40 years of activity. With four decades of success, CMP is positioned in a leading role in the private healthcare sector, recognized throughout the country and the wider region.</p><p><span></span><strong>RAMON CRESPO B. </strong>For years Panama has been emerging as a leader in the global healthcare sector, and the country has been investing in the introduction of the best international standards and technologies. We are close to reaching the highest international standards applied by leading international hospitals worldwide, and led by the most experienced doctors. We are proud of our team, and its skill and experience allows us to offer the best of service to our clients and patients. That is our mission, to improve the sector and the country at large.</p><h4>What is the importance of Human Capital at CMP?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VMDA</strong>  The health sector in general in Panama urgently needs nurses, technicians, and specialists. That is a real priority for the country. The universities are not providing the market with enough professionals for the sector, and current law stipulates that a nurse or a technician seeking to work in the healthcare sector must be Panamanian. That is a barrier for us, as we cannot hire foreign qualified workers.</p><h4>How is the clinic positioned to introduce a new approach, based on prevention and personalized medicine?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RCB</strong> The private hospitals in Panama are aligned with the ministry's vision and with the worldwide trend towards prevention medicine. Prevention means a better quality of life. Our professional background is based on prevention, and spreading this new culture forms a core part of our mission.</p><p><span></span><strong>VMDA</strong>  From a managerial and administrative point of view, prevention is becoming an important aspect of our activities. We always work hard with insurance companies to align our operations with their plans and policies and to encourage preventive examinations. This is an interesting aspect of engendering the new prevention-based culture. We have recently organized a special event for the Health National Day. We take part in and organize events based on the theme of prevention, and the campaign against cancer has been one of the most successful in the country. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Panama, and initiatives such as this are the best way to improve national awareness of the disease. This was a perfect example of synergy between public and private sector.</p><h4>How is the hospital working toward the creation of synergies with other medical institutions, both locally and internationally, to facilitate knowledge transfer in the country?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VMDA</strong> We have excellent professional relationship with our peers in the private and public healthcare sector in Panama and the region, and have a very close collaborative relation with the Cleveland Clinic in USA, since 2001, in terms of continuing medical and technical education.</p><h4>What role does technology play at CMP and how would you rate the current status of technological equipment here in Panama? How does CMP differ from other medical institutions?</h4><p><span></span><strong>RCB</strong> CMP historically have excelled in its technological emphasis and orientation, launching the first body scanner in the country in the 1980s. We have been leading the sector for decades in the field of technological equipment, as for example, 2015 marks the 15th anniversary of our oncological center, which has the most advanced equipment; we will have the most technologically MRI 3.0 Tesla launched as of today, which would be in service very soon. This is the best gift to Panama and to the region. We have recently launched also new clinic for endoscopy and pulmonary physiology, again with state-of-the-art equipment. </p><h4>What goals would you like to achieve over the medium term?</h4><p><span></span><strong>VMDA</strong> We are optimist of CMP's future.  The hospital has set an ambitious investment platform in order to maintain excellence in health service by providing the latest technological equipment and consolidated efficient operations for the coming years.  Equally important, we will continue enhancing our human resources.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[It's a Long Way]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[its-a-long-way]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on CAPAC's mission?</h4><p>In Panama, there are different levels of quality and types of investors, and we prefer to gather all the local contractors and promoters together. Of course there are always foreign firms that try to establish themselves in the country, so we invite those to the Chamber to understand our culture, our working methods, and the framework of the labor force. Construction in Panama generates around 200,000 jobs, which is a high figure in relation to the total workforce of around 1.7 million. We believe that 40% to 45% of construction costs are labor related, and we have been signing agreements with construction unions for the past four decades. Labor relations are a significant component of the history of the Chamber. The country has a law that employers can only hire one foreign national for every ten Panamanians, that is the relation in terms of labor. It is my personal opinion that we have a lack of human resources, not only in construction, but in general, and that is a major problem.</p><h4>When you say 'lack of human resources,' do you mean qualified people or in general people who want to work in the sector?</h4><p>I would say both; at the Chamber we are concerned about education, training, and accreditation. In fact, we have a special department for training and accreditation of workers in different sectors, and we created a safety department, because back in 2000 when construction started to grow, there were several accidents, which resulted in industrial action, and so we teamed up with the unions to create a safer working environment. This led to a decline in the rate of accidents at construction sites. We implemented a strong safety campaign among all members and noticed a significant decline in the statistics related to accidents in construction. These efforts are ongoing and we make sure that they are widely accessible.</p><h4>Over the last decade, Panama City has witnessed a remarkable growth in its construction sector. How would you assess the intense urbanization that is taking place in the capital?</h4><p>I would say that Panama will never again see the level of growth, in terms of construction, that it has over the past five years, as the government has pursued a particularly aggressive infrastructure plan leading to double-digit growth in 2013 and 2014. As a result, construction growth outpaced that of GDP. These were projects that benefitted society as a whole. For example, the original projections spoke of moving 120,000 people via the new subway system, whereas it is currently moving 200,000 people per day. These government-backed projects have a positive social impact in the area. We are strongly supporting the next wave of infrastructure growth, as major believers in related policies. CAPAC also understands that this government is not going to have the same facilities as the previous one, and so that is when we promote private sector cooperation to the president and government, in order to maintain sector growth of around 6.5%.</p><h4>What should be done to promote and enhance incentives for investment in real estate and construction from international investors?</h4><p>The country itself is an incentive; Panama is effectively a synonym for location. We are proud of our location, but Panama needs to explore that and take it to the next level. We have free zones here, Panama is open to opportunities for the international investors, and we always encourage developers and construction companies to come here. Our doors are open and there are no limitations to prevent anyone from becoming a member. It is important for investors to comprehend the culture, and we can do the networking that connects them with local people. That is part of the raison d'íªtre of the chamber. We generate networking and connect foreign investors with local contractors and people, and get involved in new ventures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some particularities specific to the medical sector in Panama? </h4><p>Ours is a highly competitive market with considerable demand for top quality products. Accordingly, all players within this sector maintain high standards and produce or import only those products that meet stringent standards set by the government of Panama for its acquisitions and transactions. </p><h4>Could you tell us about the domestic operations of Healthcare Products Centroamerica and how it contributes to the development of the broader healthcare sector in Panama? </h4><p>We have two main objectives, the first being to invest in the country so as to contribute to the development of the local economy, helping to create employment in the sector, thereby improving the overall standard of living for all stakeholders involved. We also contribute to state revenue through taxes, which then provide social security, services, and benefits to the population at large. Furthermore, we have a scholarship program for students from underprivileged backgrounds to study engineering degrees at two public universities. Our second objective is to import and integrate innovative medical ideas, equipment, supplies, and sustainable new generation technologies so that patients have the best quality services and supplies at their disposal at all times, providing added comfort and convenience, as well as a faster recuperation process. Also, through our operations in the sector, we help save resources in terms of limiting operational and maintenance costs, which helps allocate resources to other areas of the nation. </p><h4>Can you tell us about your product portfolio?</h4><p>Our portfolio includes equipment and services for treating and disposing of biologically infectious hospital waste, on-site oxygen production systems, all types of hospital beds, sterilization centers, ventilators, EKG, patient monitoring systems, and 220 other kinds of commercial products and equipment. </p><h4>Who are your key clients in Panama?</h4><p>We supply the Ministry of Health, the social security network, and all hospitals on a national level. </p><h4>How would you rate the quality level of medical equipment and supplies in the Panamanian medical sector? </h4><p>There are specific and rigid quality standards for each type of medical equipment we sell, and everything has to abide by those standards for us to be able to sell products to the state; these standards are fully in step with top international standards and technical requirements. </p><h4>How well does your company comply with international norms and standards when providing products for the healthcare sector in Panama? </h4><p>We fully comply with the most stringent international quality and technical standards. Panamanian law requires that we do. </p><h4>What other projects are you involved in?</h4><p>Our company is currently active in seven countries, and has been around for more than 18 years. We have operations in Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Dominican Republic. So we are active in diverse markets, and we are a big player with a lot of experience in Central American and the Caribbean. Our main area of focus for doing business is the state, with governments being our main clients, and we want to expand and create as many projects as we can in this arena, providing specialized products and solutions as are demanded by our clients and our patients throughout the country and the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the Ministry's strategy to provide universal access to healthcare to the Panamanian people?</h4><p>Universal healthcare is one of our top priorities. In spite of the large allocation of economic resources to the healthcare system, our services still do not reach all regions of the country equally. Therefore, our main efforts go towards making sure these resources do reach all Panamanians, regardless of their place of residence. We have also allocated more resources to the promotion of the healthcare system and disease prevention, especially in the most remote areas of Panama. The Ministry has prioritized investment in human resources; there is a deficit of professionals in rural Panama. We believe that these efforts will help fill the gaps in healthcare coverage. The indigenous communities are the largest population with inadequate access to healthcare due to this deficit of human resources and lack of adequate infrastructure. In this context, we have several ongoing projects in the field. </p><h4>How important is prevention and how does the Ministry tackle this issue?</h4><p>The best investment is always in prevention and promotion of healthcare. Data shows that for every $1-2 invested in prevention and promotion, the country saves $9 in health care costs. This is a top priority for us and that is why we have revised our budget to allocate more resources to these efforts. Preventive healthcare will enable us to invest in large health infrastructure projects. Our main efforts in prevention go to cardiac and cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, as these require simple and low cost measures such as active lifestyles and regular exercise to generate important results. We also want to take action in schools and regulate the food we give to our children as well as encourage nutritious eating.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to create synergies with other ministries to attract foreign investment in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>Investment in the health sector has been particularly relevant over the past few years. We have five top hospitals of the highest international standards when it comes to technological equipment and quality services. These achievements have been possible thanks to joint efforts of the government and private sector. The public sector is the facilitator of foreign investment. In this context, we do work alongside other ministries to develop human resources and key strategies for the sector—we have the so-called social cabinet, in which we discuss actions that imply efforts from several fields such as the Ministries of Education, Social Affairs, Health, as well as the President's office.</p><h4>What is the strategy of the Ministry to establish international partnerships to boost the transfer of know-how to Panama?</h4><p>One of our priorities is to analyze international experiences and learn from them. The Ministry has already signed several partnerships with Spain and Uruguay, among others. Our objective is to learn from those experiences in those countries and take the best for our country. </p><h4>What is the potential for Panama to become a regional hub within the medical tourism segment?</h4><p>Panama is already a geographical and infrastructure hub for the region. Panama has the services, capabilities, and resources to become areal top destination within the medical tourism sector. As the Ministry, we should also take the lead to give the sector a boost by providing the industry with support.</p><h4>What are the main goals of the Ministry for 2015?</h4><p>We believe there is a lack of investment in human resources, especially in rural Panama. This is one of our top priorities—the present and the future of professionals within the health sector. We have signed partnerships with key universities in the country to increase the capabilities of these institutions. We will also develop new infrastructure and push forward several key projects neglected by the previous administration.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current state of development of the construction and real estate industry in Panama?</h4><p>After five years in Panama, we couldn't be more satisfied with our success. The Panamanian market offers numerous opportunities and is expanding. The country offers stability and there are great prospects for growth and development. The sector features many established players, and yet still offers many opportunities to newcomers. For example, we were recognized as the best selling company in the industry in terms of volume, after just one year in Panama. Our main clients are foreign nationals, especially Venezuelans. We play a key role in making sure that foreign investment in the sector is channeled in a secure and solid manner. </p><h4>How would characterize your competitive advantages?</h4><p>We offer a solid and high quality service; in addition to championing creativity we have generated confidence among our investors through our performance. Meanwhile, we pay close attention to detail, which makes a difference when providing high quality services.</p><h4>Which are the most common properties you handle, and which are in greatest demand?</h4><p>A year ago, we had an important number of investors buying high-end properties. At the moment, the situation has changed and we do not have such a strong focus on high-end properties, but volumes have not suffered. Last year, we closed a large number of transactions. The market today has moved toward more economical properties, having more targeted properties and we have also seen increased demand for commercial properties.</p><h4>What are the prospects for commercial properties?</h4><p>Demand for these properties has grown over the past couple of years, and despite a recent slowdown, I expect considerable growth for next year too. We will see an increase in the arrival of companies in the country, which will boost demand for offices in Panama.</p><h4>What is the balance between local and international investors in your client portfolio?</h4><p>Our key clients we are from Venezuela, Spain, Italy and other European countries. Over the past few months, we have seen a rising number of Latin Americans. Around 70% of our international client portfolio derives from Venezuela, and the remainder from elsewhere.</p><h4>What kind of relationship do the real estate and the banking sectors currently have in Panama?</h4><p>In the financial arena, the banking sector does offer notable support to the real estate sector in Panama. Indeed, as Venezuelan investors, we face several restrictions in terms of fulfilling bank requirements. Nevertheless, the banking system has been extremely supportive. Over the last few months we have seen the banking sector open to the international community through credit lines.</p><h4>In which segments of the sector do you see the highest demand?</h4><p>I would definitely say in the residential segment. We have seen an increasing interest in purchasing residential properties and also office properties, for there are many companies planning to move to Panama.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2015?</h4><p>Our objective is for the company to consolidate its activities on the strength of our reputation. We plan to develop strategic partnerships with companies in Miami and Orlando in the US. We have high expectations and believe we have a bright future ahead.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With an investment of $2 billion, the metro is the second largest infrastructure investment in the country after de Canal. How is this benefitting the development of the country?</h4><p>The contribution to Panama´s development starts with direct benefits to the residents of Panama City, where over 40% of the population of Panama works or reside. The specific benefits are travel time savings, savings in operating cost of private vehicles and public transportation, reduction in air pollution and reduction in traffic accidents. Benefits were quantified as part of the feasibility analysis under the scenarios with and without Line 1 of the metro, with the metro delivering between $150 and $190 million in yearly savings at the start of operations and growing to as much as $400 million by 2035.  These savings mainly would translate into labor productivity, by reducing the burden of excessive travel time for daily transportation. In addition, the project generated direct economic benefits during its construction stage. </p><h4>Line 1 was completed in 2014. How did the local population receive it, and what is your strategy to encourage people to uses this new system of transportation?</h4><p>The best indicator of the population embracing the project has been the sustained growth in ridership. Line 1 is currently transporting 23,000 passenger per hour at peak demand, which is in line with originally projected estimates.  Daily passenger demand, however, is over 50% higher than was originally estimated.  In other words, the metro usage during off peak hours is significantly higher than expected. The metro's strategy to attract users is to maintain a high level of service quality and to expand the rolling stock fleet to augment capacity over the short and mid-term.</p><h4>What are the features of the existing line?</h4><p>Line 1 has an overall length of 15.7 km from the San Isidro Station to the Albrook station. Currently the service is offered over a length of 13.7 kilometers of line and 13 passenger stations from the beginning of the line to the Los Andes station. The operation to the San Isidro station will start this coming August, increasing the number of stations to 14. Of the overall length, 7.2 km are underground; the same distance on an elevated viaduct and 1.3 kilometers is in trench. The system has been designed to transport 40,000 passengers per hour per direction, with a train configuration of 5 wagons running at a time interval (headway) of 90 seconds, which results in 40 train services per hour. Currently our service frequency is 20 trains per hour with a configuration of 3 wagons per train.</p><h4>How will the expanded network of the Metro be integrated with the existing forms of transportation in the city?</h4><p>Since we first defined the metro network in July 2009, the system has been conceived as a structural component of the integrated public transportation system of Panama's metropolitan area. In parallel with the development of the Metro network, the restructuring of the traditional bus services began with the creation of the Metrobus service for the municipalities of Panama City and San Miguelito. The integration of the metro with the public bus transportation has three dimensions: the operational, the physical and the combined fare. In terms of the operation, the proposal is to restructure the public transport system toward a main line feeder type system, where the main corridors are served by the metro and the public buses provide feeder service and attend secondary corridors. The process has already begun in the corridor of the metro's Line 1, where parallel services by the two systems have been minimized and new feeder routes have been created. Regarding the fare integration, both the metro and the buses share the same fare collection and recharging system with the use of smart cards that are interchangeable. The financial administrator is the same for both operators. Currently, integrated fares for both systems are being evaluated. Physical integration is progressing through the construction of passenger exchange facilities between the metro and the public bus system, and within the public bus system internally. Line 2 of the metro includes a major passenger station called UTP that will provide service to the nearby Tocumen International Airport, initially by means of a shuttle bus system and in the long-term with the use of an Automated People Mover directly linking the metro with the airport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the evolution of the IT sector in Panama?</h4><p>Panama is like a small version of the US Silicon Valley in terms of technology, where customers demand the latest releases. From a sales and innovation perspective, they also want the best solutions. Panama invests heavily in technology. On the street you see people everywhere with the latest cell phones and tablets; the country, then, is open to innovation. </p><h4>How are you bridging your clients to the future?</h4><p>I am an innovator, and act on this principle to deliver the best service to my clients. With cloud computing, while all are familiar with it, few fully know what it enables. The future lies in cloud solutions. We have been selling cloud solutions for three years, and the issue of security has been high on the agenda. Security is not a product, but a process, and to my thinking the future of security lies not in products. </p><h4>Are local companies willing to invest in innovative and modern IT solutions? </h4><p>SMEs are our current focus. When I approach businesses I talk to people who share the same problems as the largest companies. At the bigger companies it takes months to make decisions. Companies, large or small—always require assistance. We work with both construction and engineering companies, where payroll management can be a particular challenge. We put the payroll software and hardware on the cloud facilitating project operations and seamless payments. </p><h4>How much are you investing to establish strategic partnerships to enhance the quality of your service?</h4><p>We have partnerships with Microsoft, HP, Fortinet, F5, Acronis, and VMware. We are the first company in the region to have received Gold Partner of F5 and HP Cloud Builder Certification. Our partners support us to offer the best service in the country. That is why we don't sell servers, networks or computers. We convert components into a single product for our customers, whom we also service at no charge. This is our collateral service that makes our company highly competitive.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand your business beyond Panama?</h4><p>We are trying to plan to expand into Costa Rica. Another place we are looking into is Guatemala. I think that for now, Costa Rica is a priority because there is a secure environment without many risks.</p><h4>You work both for the government and the private sector. What specific area of the economy are you targeting to expand into?</h4><p>I would identify health. We started a few months ago supporting a small number of doctors but today service 75, confirming the potential of the sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company was founded back in 2000, and after 15 years of activity how would you describe the evolution of the company?</h4><p>We started in 2001 with 4 ha of property and one crane. We currently have six cranes and 20 employees.  Most of our business is with private enterprises, around 95%. We work with shipping  companies, construction companies, refrigeration, air-conditioning and storage companies here in Colon. We are the only established crane company in Colon. Of course, the European crisis has affected smaller companies such as ours more than our larger competitors. A lot of large companies and ports own their cranes, but there is a lot of work they cannot do. We are also involved in storage activities and some companies, such as Maersk, store empty containers in our yard. We also carry out transshipment. Although there are huge storage companies close to the ports, most of them do not store small quantities of empty containers, and for long periods of time, that is for 20-30 or 40-50 days, which we are happy to assist with at lower prices. We also help local transportation enterprises. We store their equipment over night, as well as vans. Our storage is secured by 24 hours surveillance.</p><h4>What is your strategy to widen your share both in the crane and storage business?</h4><p>We have a solid reputation in the local market and we have digitized our operations. </p><h4>How do you apply the best standards in terms of safety?</h4><p>We have not had an accident in 15 years. We believe in the maintenance of our equipment. This is a family enterprise, and our workers are treated as such; we take care of each other. Our operators are certified. Our riggers are certified. Our equipment receives constant maintenance. Technicians from the US have commended our crane maintenance. We believe in safety, and our labor laws require it. Our employees have a lot of advantages; they have full overtime coverage, education stipends, transportation, and meals incentives. If we have to work for over 24 hours continuously, we put the working teams in a nice hotel, so their resting periods are assured. </p><h4>How will the canal expansion affect your business? </h4><p>It depends on whether the ships will have a lay over, or if they will go right through the Canal. As I understand, the government is working to establish a large logistic hub covering land, rail, air and sea transportation. There will be an exchange of containers coming in and out. SMEs have raised concerns that they do not have the capacity to compete with larger enterprises. Many companies are procuring straight from China. This has implications for the Colon Free Trade Zone. We are expanding our yard storage to be able to provide services for the increase in empty containers. More ships mean more containers.</p><h4>What are your goals for the end of 2015?</h4><p>We hope to expand our storage capacity and attract investment. We are looking forward to the increase in construction work, where we hope to be able to  offer crane services. We recently acquired a license for maritime auxiliary services to be able to provide more port services. We are looking forward to diversify into repairing containers. We will continue to prioritize our social responsibility commitments and aid with disaster management in our community, as well as continuing to sponsor local football leagues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the current state of development of COTEL's activities nationwide?</h4><p>COTEL is an organization closely linked to the government, having been the social arm of the state for over 110 years. President Varela is committed to the social development of Panama and we form the logistical backbone. Our nationwide postal coverage, a branch network of 119 offices, provides a service to the most vulnerable and remote communities in Panama. Yet we are keen to expand our wide range of services further. One initiative we aim to introduce is the ability to pay taxes and other duties at post offices. We are currently undergoing a transformation process, as the Panamanian postal network is in need of a technological overhaul. We have plans to systemize the national postal network, which will enable us to improve our services to society. We also have plans to upgrade our fleet and provide increased security for postal products. We will be renewing our brand in line with the transformation process. Our new brand will be dynamic, reliable and modern, and one that inspires public confidence in our services that enhance the life of Panamanians.</p><h4>Which part of the country is destined for the greatest proportion of investment toward this transformation process?</h4><p>Our priority is macro, rather than micro capacity building. Having said that, it is obvious that Panama City requires the greatest investment, being the most populous part of Panama. The Chiriqui region receives a large number of tourists, so that will also be an investment priority.  Additionally, the Darien, Herrera, Coclé and Colón regions require investment. </p><h4>What is the company's portfolio within financial services?</h4><p>Our financial services mainly focus on monetary transfers, including remittances, which can be executed either by phone or fax. We have seen considerable activity in this segment in the Darien region, where a high number of hotel projects are being developed. In Darien, each post office generates around $80,000-$90,000 from financial services. </p><h4>How does the company engage with international partners to improve the services offered and further integrate itself within a global postal network?</h4><p>We are currently holding talks with the International Postal Union for inclusion within the agreements system. We hope to sign agreements in countries that have sizable Panamanian expatriate communities, such as Cuba, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and El Salvador. We are affiliated to the International Postal Union as well as the Postal Union of the Americas, Spain and Portugal; we follow the international regulatory framework of both unions. The regulatory framework is established through a democratic process, where at an international congress, 190 countries together decide on strategies and implementation. Today's Panamanian postal service operates to high international standards.</p><h4>What role does e-commerce play in your overall activity?</h4><p>Panamanian society is no stranger to global trends, and e-commerce is becoming a common purchasing medium. We have developed a special service within this segment, namely Cotelbox. Through it, we receive the produce people buy online and then transport their parcels and orders. We are part of a global network and want to make sure users understand the benefits of selecting COTEL for their online purchases. Panama is an international country and we have to make sure we meet international demand.</p><h4>What are your main objectives for 2015?</h4><p>By the end of this year COTEL will be working within a pre-established budget. We have several challenges ahead, as well as objectives. COTEL was established to serve Panama and its people and we work to demonstrate that they are our top priority. Improving the working and living conditions of our employees is also a essential. We intend also to invest in COTEL's integrated logistics center, a physical meeting point for all our postal activities, to ensure operations are fast, efficient and secure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main factors and indicators of growth in the sector?</h4><p>From an electricity standpoint, we have clear indicators related to energy consumption and daily maximum demand, both of which are rising. We have seen sustained annual demand growth over the past five or six years of over 5% on average, which foretells the arrival of significant further investment. And meanwhile, all indicators point to firm growth, which is no surprise given the strong economic performance Panama is currently displaying.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the main projects attracting government investment?</h4><p>Developments are mostly observed in the private sector. We indicate how much power is required, and then organize tenders to award concessions to power companies, which then build the necessary facilities. Currently, we have a short-term tender to ensure sufficient power as we experienced shortages two years ago. We have received two bids each for 350 MW of capacity. We will collect as many offers as possible and award up to 350 MW to a combination of potential investors. That should come between the spring of 2018 and 2020 and suffice to underpin electricity sector growth. There are plans in place to undertake sequential lines, and our distribution is carried out according to a planned schedule.</p><h4>The country heavily relies on hydropower. Which other alternatives is the government considering?</h4><p>In the past we have placed much emphasis on hydropower as an economically viable alternative, as it is a clean and well-proven solution. Last year close to 60% of our electricity generation came from this source, although we have been seriously considering alternative options. Hydropower projects are rapidly diminishing as many have already been completed, but there will be a large number of smaller hydro projects coming online to support economic growth. This will become less important over time. Our reliance on rain is affected by seasonal variation, but we are able to plan in anticipation of this. In the renewables field we have been looking at wind, and a privately developed 280 MW wind power plant has been set up in the midlands. This will be the largest of its type in Central America. We also have an active group of people working on solar energy, which previously had been prohibitively expensive to develop. In Panama we have chosen to neglect solar energy development and let other countries such as Spain and Germany pursue it. New technology is expensive, and we lack the ability and experience to work on solar energy. There is, however, a high level of interest in developing it here. And it is becoming more economical, with differences even in comparison with last year. We are hoping to integrate different energy sources in a combined grid. For a time we thought the solution was to move toward natural gas, but ultimately we found ourselves in a situation where the price of oil dropped, rendering it more competitive. We anticipate some good offers in oil and gas depending on prices and escalation trends.</p><h4>What has to be done to transform Panama into a leading energy sector player?</h4><p>LNG pricing in different regions varies considerably. There is currently no cost-effective means of transporting LNG from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The largest consumers of LNG, such as Japan, obtain it from the Atlantic, where prices are more favorable. Meanwhile, we expect the expansion of the Panama Canal to have a major factor in making LNG an obtainable commodity. At the moment this is problematic because of long-term contracts and point-to-point deliveries. There is, then, not really a fluid commodity market in place for LNG today, although strong potential exists to develop one. We have hopes of Panama becoming a center for storage solutions. In the long term, ships will be using LNG for propulsion, which will make the LNG business more flexible. The government is actively assessing the situation and its alternatives, and the moment it is deemed favorable we will make our move. What we do not want to do is enter the business ourselves; we simply want to ensure that it is being done properly.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of the electricity connection agreement signed by President Varela and President Santos of Colombia?</h4><p>Central American nations as a whole are smaller than Colombia, and it has taken us a long time to work out a deal. We developed a strong framework agreement to establish connectivity between the two states, in which we perceive strong potential. The facilities and institutions are there, but it is difficult to get underway due to certain environmental considerations. This will require time more than anything else. We have long since formulated the economic dimension of the agreement, and know the potential and future scenario. The political will is there, and project feasibility has been established.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the current trends in the media industry?</h4><p>The media industry in Panama is facing a downturn. There is resentment amongst the public regarding the lack of transparency of the previous government. There are still many unanswered questions about the use of public funds by officials. The media needs to ensure its democratic role, and that the judiciary brings the guilty to justice. At the same time, there is a huge trend in terms of how the public has accepted new types of media. This sometimes hurts the traditional ones like us because people are not interested in the complete truth and analysis. They prefer the short straightforward version, which might not be the correct one. It is the media industry's job to be able to cater to that public, while providing verifiable information and it can get tricky.</p><h4>How do you increase your presence in the local market in terms of coverage?</h4><p>This is a challenge, Panamanians have a limited income and our paper is very expensive, selling for $2. We follow what is happening with the economy, we follow what is happening with the banks, and with the insurance companies, car sales, and so on, because these reflect how the economy is doing and how the people of Panama are living. Most of the our readers are business people, because they want to know what is going on in the economy, so they can make investment decisions and follow developments in the business environment. We are the most reliable economics-related newspaper in the country, even though we are a weekly title. Not only do we write about current economic issues, but we also look at future movements and trends in the economy. </p><h4>How do you ensure the integrity of the information that you provide to your readers?</h4><p>We only source official information, we work with the Treasury, we work with the Ministries, and with the Department of Statistics. In Panama, it is very difficult to find accurate information on companies, as very few are listed on the stock exchange, and therefore not obliged to transparency. The insurance and banking sector supervisors have information available online, which helps get up-to-date information on sector developments. That is applicable for a number of sectors, such as automobiles; companies generally post monthly car sales figures online, for example, and include information and a breakdown about the brands and models. We have several expert journalists capable of pointing out any potential irregularities in the numbers to maximize accuracy of information delivery.</p><h4>Is having an online platform eroding the sales and readership of the paper?</h4><p>Not for now. Panama is a special market. Our online readers do overlap with some of our paper subscribers, but they are different markets. This is what makes Panama so special and helps our industry as well. In other countries, this is definitely the case, but we seem to be moving slowly. Our Panamanian readership prefers the more traditional paper. This is closely related to our age group audience. Our online readership is somewhat younger, so we are now focused on catering to their needs and likes. We have had a long discussion about this topic. However, we truly believe we are to modify paper and digital in separate arenas. For example, about whether we should start to charge people to use the website or else leave it accessible to all. We may impose a charge at some point in the future, but today those with access to the internet, or even those with a smart phone do not go online in the same manner as someone in the US or Europe might. Panamanians are not avid readers and this is a problem if you want to start asking people to pay to read a news article online when they have always read it for free.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are you creating partnerships between the Ministry of Education and universities?</h4><p>We are doing this by fostering the advancement of skills and talent of Panama's human capital. Since 2005, we have been funding scholarships for Panamanians to obtain advanced degrees abroad. So far, more than 1,900 Panamanian students have attended foreign universities in the US, UK, Germany, France, Spain and throughout Latin America for undergraduate and graduate education. Many have graduated with Master's degrees and PhDs. They return to Panama ready and willing to become professors at our universities and to become active participants in advancing our economy. Currently, we spend more than $12 million annually solely on tuition fees in the US, which is a substantial sum for a country of this size. Other key activities of SENACYT are funding research projects of local academics, supporting capacity building of laboratories and financing the strengthening of graduate programs of our universities. For Panama, SENACYT is the equivalent of a National Science Foundation. Since 2004, it has awarded 359 science research grants worth more than $20 million. SENACYT also has a major effort underway with the Ministry of Education to modernize STEM education through a strong teacher-training program. This will benefit universities by providing them with better-qualified applicants. </p><h4>How much is the private sector investing to develop technology and knowledge transfer?</h4><p>Panama historically has been a country based in trade and services, particularly in the transportation arena, but we need to keep up with global trends in science and technology. Private sector investment in technology is considerable, although there are needs to give a greater emphasis in innovation and the creation of new knowledge. One innovative company is Calesa, a large aquaculture enterprise, whose shrimp stock at one point collapsed due to a virus and they resolved the problem through science. But much more needs to be done, particularly in the agriculture area.</p><h4>What is SENACYT doing to instill the importance of investing in science?</h4><p>President Varela is a Georgia Tech-trained engineer who believes in the importance of investing in science. Together with the executive branch, SENACYT has drawn a strategic plan on science and technology for the next five years and developed a policy for the next 30 years.   Specifically, we have been engaging in strategic alliances with the business community with programs that provide financial support for mature innovative business models and seed capital to smaller enterprises to develop innovations. </p><h4>Which sectors require the greatest investment?</h4><p>The government has identified certain economic sectors destined for development, such as logistics, mining, tourism and agriculture. But the base for any future growth in these areas has to be education, with an emphasis in science, technology, and innovation. At SENACYT, we believe that logistics and agriculture should receive great attention. For example, agriculture, which represents 3% of GDP but employs around 18% the population, must incorporate more technology for it to be productive, competitive and sustainable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Cervecerí­as Baru Panama was launched back in 1960. What has its growth strategy been since then?</h4><p>Baru Cervecerias Panamastarted as a family business in David in 1960 brewing local beers such as Cristal, Panama, and Soberana. In 1970, the company began operations in Panama City and in 2002 we, at Heineken, acquired the business for the Vallarino family. At the time, the company's market share was about 12% and the plant capacity and conditions were poor. Since then, Heineken has been investing in this country, in the company, and professionalizing operations to grow our business</p><h4>In that regard, how much are you investing in human capital?</h4><p>For us, training is about growth. It is about growing as an individual, it is about growing as a team and it is about our motivations to improve. It is important for the staff to feel proud of the company they work for. Last year we provided over 7,000 man-hours of training across the company. However, more can always be done, and our 350 employees undergo yearly trainings. We also work to customize training and improve the functional and leadership skills of our staff.</p><h4>On production, you mentioned water's critical role, but where do you source hops?</h4><p>We source most of our hops from Europe. We have global contracts organized by Global Procurement, which treats it as a commodity; it is a sophisticated purchase.</p><h4>Panama and Latin America in general is brimming with competition. What is your strategy to widen your share of the market? </h4><p>Competition is tough, as our local competitors are both strong and focused. Over the past years we have grown at impressive rates, as has the beer industry, but our own growth has outperformed the beer market average. The beer market grew over 5.5% in 2014, while Cervecarí­as Baru saw double-digit growth. We produce an excellent high-quality product, but continuously work to improve it. As a result, we have won five gold medals on our PANAMA brand granted by Monde Selection, a leading European institute that certifies the quality of consumer products. At the end of 2014, we launched Panama Light, which is a star product. It is a great product and moreover, the only locally produced light beer; as opposed to the rest of the market which commercializes American brands. This is naturally a source of pride for us. In 2014, we launched Soberana Radler, which is our Soberana  beer with a spark of natural lemon juice. Hence, quality and innovation is and will be our growth pillars on the coming years.</p><h4>The Minister for Health is promoting a healthier lifestyle and stricter law regarding DUI. What kinds of market opportunities are presented here for non-alcoholic beverages?</h4><p>Beer is a natural product and stands out amongst all alcoholic beverages on the market. Beer is fermented; it is not a distilled alcohol, which makes a huge difference in terms of how your body absorbs the alcohol. Beer has a low level of alcohol, usually between 4 and 5 degrees, and in Panama, beer is mostly consumed for all types of celebrations and social gatherings. We are highly conscious about promoting responsible consumption and there are many ways in which we do this. One such way is to invest in lower alcohol and non-alcoholic beers, such as Soberana Radler, which has a 2% alcohol content but a very refreshing taste. It is a risky investment, but one well worth it. </p><h4>What are the main targets, goals, or ambitions that you hope to achieve by the end of this 2015?</h4><p>The year of 2015 bears numerous challenges. My major concern is listening to consumers and understanding their needs. In that spirit, innovation is critical. Meanwhile, we have signed a major five-year sponsorship agreement with our PANAMA brand and the FEDEBEIS, the Panamanian Baseball Federation, in a program to foster and further develop baseball as the  national sport it currently is. At Cervecerias Baru we strive to surprise Panama and the rest of the world with our brands, people and performance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors make Honda a strong player in the local market?</h4><p>The technology behind our cars is the product of extensive research and development. We have a new Pilot model in the works, and the HRV, which is an entry segment vehicle below the CRV. We have not participated in that market in Panama, but are set to do so with a lower-end passenger car. The local market has increased by around 10%, underpinned by rising demand for low-end models. We have observed growth in certain segments, where for example the CRV, a compact SUV, is our best selling model. It won the SUV of the Year award from Motor Trend in the US. In Panama we represent Honda and Accura, which is our higher-end brand. The MDX is selling well, and we also market the Pilot and the Odyssey, which most of our competitors do not carry. </p><h4>What is your strategy for differentiating your brand from the competition?</h4><p>The plan is to develop Bahia Motors into a boutique operation. Rather than appealing to the mass market, we plan to go down the premium road. We are investing in new showrooms around the country, where the population is increasing. It is also important to improve our current showrooms, and offer new and appealing products. For example, we are changing the look and feel of our existing showrooms to ensure a memorable buying experience. This will appeal to premium customers. If the customer has a technical problem that requires extensive repair, we provide a replacement vehicle. Our cars have different amenities that are in demand, such as security, suspension, and engine technology. Honda produces private jets, and that technology is incorporated into the design of its engines. There is a lot of technology behind the wheel of a Honda, and the CVR LX is a prime example of this. We offer a premium Honda with better specs than the competitors. </p><h4>How do you optimize the efficiency of your services?</h4><p>Our service department is of an excellent standard. We work exclusively with Honda generated parts, and all of our technicians are certified. In order to become a Honda technician you have to be certified by Honda in the US. Prior to that certification, technicians also require online training and take various tests of competence. All of our technicians are certified to the maximum level and we have the gold starred certification from Honda Motors, which is certified in each category they go into. Human capital is always important, because Panama is a small country that in undergoing rapid economic expansion, which is trailed by its ability to provide qualified workers. Many people are migrating to Panama to cover our lack of skilled labor. This means we are always looking for skilled staff in the car industry. The segment is overextended and dealers are perpetually poaching from one another.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the company's expansion and consolidation strategy in Panama?</h4><p>We are set to expand into the provinces, where we are already building new showrooms. We also have an expanding motorcycle segment with 4 wheelers and MUVs. In Panama, the Chorrera district is growing significantly, and today metro lines reach the areas in which we plan to expand.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Hosting the 2015 Summit of the Americas enabled Panama to gather the global community to discuss regional development prospects. What gains has hosting given industry?</h4><p>The summit was an important marketing tool to promote the countries global diplomatic image.  Panama is keen to build stronger diplomatic relations with its neighbors, a recent success being Panama's role as a mediator in the peace talks between Cuba and the US. The summit hosted a wide-range of stakeholders, including those beyond the political sphere, such as the business community, represented by the most influential business people of the region. The summit was an opportunity to showcase the logistical prowess and liberal regulatory framework of the state to industry. This includes the Panama Canal, the safe FDI environment and a substantial number of free trade agreements including with the US and EU.  At the summit, US President Obama and President Varela were witnesses in the signing of a $6 billion agreement between Copa and Boeing for the purchase of new planes. Commercial airlines in Panama travel to over 140 destinations on a weekly basis. Panama City, due to its geo-strategic location, has the capacity to be the most inter-connected city in Latin America.</p><h4>Colón Free Zone represents Panama's main export and re-export hub. What is the importance of this free zone to the national economy?</h4><p>The geo-strategic centrality of Colón Free Zone is important with regard to logistical services. In 2014, $14 billion of cargo moved in and out of the country were re-exports from the free zone. MNCs, such as P&amp;G, have been utilizing the facilities in Colon Colón for their Latin American distribution operations.</p><h4>China, Singapore, US, Belgium, and UK are the main importing countries for Panama. Which other countries are you targeting?</h4><p>Our target is to double our exports in the next five years. We have a copper mine project in the pipeline worth $6 billion, and this is attracting FDI. Once the plant is in operation we are expecting the total exports of copper from Panama to be around $2 billion. Our investment agency, Proinvex, focuses mainly on South America, especially Colombia and Venezuela. Our European market also consists of the Netherlands, Germany and Spain, where we are hoping to expand. Our US focus is MNCs. Proinvex will be hosting PR events in Washington and New York, and is also planning on hosting events in other US centers.</p><h4>The current expansion of the Canal will be successfully concluded in 2016. How will this project stimulate the growth of commercial activities in Panama?</h4><p>The Panama Canal was taken over by the Panamanian government on December 31, 1999. Prior to that, it was operated by the US government. Since we have taken over control, we have continually invested in the canal, and our latest expansion efforts it is hoped will enable millions of barrels of gas to pass through Panama. This will enable Panama to become a regional energy hub. We are also investing in a third set of locks, which will create additional maritime routes. Agricultural cycles are different in the southern part of the hemisphere to the northern part, they are seasonally opposite. Companies with agri-industrial facilities have to plant on each side of the equator. We are hoping that our canal expansion plans will improve the infrastructure available to agri-business.</p><h4>What are the ambitions, priorities and goals that you hope to achieve?</h4><p>We expect the growth rate to remain at around 6-7%, far above the regional average of 6%. We are growing 10 times faster than the regional average rate. The current level of unemployment in Panama is around 5.2%. The level of inflation is just under 2.6%. Our investment package is worth over $20 billion for the next five years. Our largest government investment initiative for this year is worth around $5 billion. According to the World Economic Forum, Panama is one of the most economically competitive countries globally. We are working closely in partnership with MNCs in order to create favorable conditions for manufacturing,  to diversify our economic activities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does PromPeru play in promoting Peru internationally and domestically?</h4><p>Our mandate is essentially the promotion of our country, both domestically and abroad. In recent years, domestic tourism has played an important role for our country and an increasing number of Peruvian operators have turned their attention to the domestic tourist. In the past, it was much less of an interesting market. However, since infrastructure and income has improved, so has the capacity to sell holidays to Peruvians. We don't just promote, we also develop strategies to boost competitive destinations. On the other hand, we are focused on the diversification of Peruvian destinations. In this sense, our responsibility is not only to promote traditional destinations, but also to identify new and less-known alternatives. With regard to promotion abroad, we are focused on the Latin American market and the US. The latter represents 16% of the market. </p><h4>How important is tourism from neighboring countries to your strategy?</h4><p>Over the past year we have been working to increase interest among our neighbors Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia. We have more than 800,000 Chilean tourists crossing the border annually. Most of them visit Peru because of health, commerce, and tourism. Gastronomy is also becoming an important attraction. Our advertising pool is focused on the north of Chile and southern Ecuador. </p><h4>What are the biggest challenges confronting Peru in terms of tourism promotion?</h4><p>The challenge is the diversification of our offer. We are well positioned with Cuzco and Machu Picchu as the main cultural attractions. We also have nature, beaches and a varied geography that allows for interesting adventure tourism. At the moment, we are focused on eight regions. In the south, Machu Picchu will always be the star. But we are else promoting aggressively Arequipa and Puno. Arequipa with the deepest canyons in the world, is our second city, and aside from international tourism, attracts the greatest number of domestic tourists after Ica. This city is also gaining attention because it is going to host five important international events, placing it in the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) ranking. In Puno, we have rural tourism due to the lake and we are hoping Tacna will become a gastronomy hub. </p><h4>What efforts have you been making to promote domestic tourism?</h4><p>Three years ago we were evaluating possible strategies to encourage Peruvians to take their holidays locally and all year round. We wanted to make traveling a habit, and years ago, Peruvians traveled regularly and then the numbers decreased because of internal problems. We wanted people to reengage with traveling and make it easy and stress-free. We started an online campaign called “¿Y tú qué planes?" in 2012. Today, the travel search-engine that we created for “¿Y tú qué planes?" is the second most used among travelers after Google in Peru. We worked with operators in each region to create accessible information. We won an award from the World Tourism Organization for the campaign and domestic travel in Peru grew 4% last year. </p><h4>What makes Lima a good destination for MICE tourism?</h4><p>Lima is an international hub in a privileged location. The capital city has great infrastructure and many international brands are attracted to the city. The cuisine is world class, and the city's political environment is generally stable. The quality of services is respected and well known and infrastructure and investments in the city are increasing. </p><h4>Could private investors play a larger role in developing Peru's tourism industry?</h4><p>Yes, and not only in infrastructure, but across the board. Spain is one of the most important investors in Peru. The corporate sector is growing and flight connections are increasing. Lima is not the only destination attracting investor interest, as Tacna has done so, too. </p><h4>What are your key goals for 2016? </h4><p>We want to attract four million tourists to Peru. We have to consolidate markets such as US and Latin America, and will increase our work in these strategic markets through trade and campaigns. It is important to mention that there has been an increase in competition from regional states. We have to stay attractive in order to sustain growth at the same pace. We will keep working on innovative strategies and new products in relation to nature, adventure and culture depending on the demand of the different markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

As a consequence, Panama has dove tailed with GE as the perfect location to lead and coordinate the Central America and Caribbean region, an area with huge potential for all our businesses.</p><h4>In which specific areas do you report an increasing need for your products and services?</h4><p>In general, the countries of Central America and the Caribbean are at a key moment in their development as nations, looking to take a quality leap in industries such oil and gas, healthcare, energy, water treatment, transportation, or lighting, in a way that decisions will lead to immediate and positive impact in every citizen's life. In this environment, GE supports sound government policies and could become a world-class partner in many areas for the betterment of the quality of life of its citizens. With appropriate solutions for the national needs, local and regional capacity to develop projects, particularly those involving public-private participation. GE's with more than 130 years of research and technological solutions development becomes the partner of choice for many initiatives.</p><h4>The Panamanian Government is currently working to modernize the national power grid. What specific solutions does GE offer for the modernization and implementation of the national grid?</h4><p>We develop solutions made for the different needs that may exist, for example: GE Oil and Gas is world leader in advanced technology equipment and services for all segments of the oil and gas industry, from exploration and production to downstream. GE Power and Water provides a broad array of power generation, energy delivery, and water process technologies to solve global challenges. Power &amp; Water works in several areas of the energy industry, including wind and solar, biogas, and alternative fuels. Its business solutions include aero derivative gas turbines and heavy-duty gas turbines, nuclear energy, steam turbines and generators and renewable energy. On the other hand, GE Energy Management designs technology solutions for the transmission, distribution, management, conversion, and optimization of electrical power across multiple energy-intensive industries through its four business lines: digital energy, industrial solutions, power conversion, and energy consulting.</p><h4>The expanded Canal will be able to handle estimated 12 million metric tons of LNG on a yearly basis. How will GE support the development of business related to LNG in the country?</h4><p>LNG is a resource with a wide range of possibilities for energy generation with the additional benefit that it is a cleaner and cost efficient fuel. LNG is greatly exploited in the region, so there is a significant amount for both private and public sectors to explore the possibility of moving and using this type of gas, mainly for power generation but there are other significant applications such as transportation and industrial operations. We could say that LNG is an option gaining its place initially in the regional energy matrix and it will be quite likely that it will find its ways into other areas.  The Caribbean basin in particular has at its extremes significant sources of fuel: US Gulf and Trinidad and Tobago could lead toward transportation cost efficiencies, a prerequisite for its use in the region. Moreover, the regional LNG market will require a location to store, manage, and redistribute, and Panama with the expanded Canal and becoming an LNG route has the opportunity to become key player in the product supply chain—a natural for Panama thanks to its geographical location. Considering LNG as a possible fuel for power generation, it represents a lot to do in terms of management, transportation, and infrastructure for its proper commercialization and further processing of the final product in the region. Aware of this, we are closely working with local efforts from Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, who collaborate with equipment and technology to support LNG terminals and natural gas power generation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Universidad del Sinú started out as a modest local school in Córdoba. How has the university expanded to become one of the largest on the Caribbean coast?</h4><p>My father, of Lebanese extraction, initially founded a nocturnal school aimed at lower income individuals that wanted to study in the city of Monterí­a in Córdoba. The school had an agricultural technology program, which was relevant as Córdoba has a strong tradition of activity in that sector. After this he founded a private university in Monterí­a that began with a law program. He contacted the court stenographers in Monterí­a and provided them with scholarships so they could get a law degree. Nowadays, there are a number of different faculties in the university, including health, law, and engineering, and we have around 7,000-8,000 students registered here. It is the third largest business in Córdoba in terms of services offered and revenue. I studied in the US, but upon my return I opened our institution in Cartagena with an ophthalmology program. After careful consideration we decided that Cartagena was the ideal location to internationalize the university. Today, after 14 years the university in Cartagena has around 3,000 students. Cartagena has a major  poverty situation. Small entrepreneurs comprise around 90% of the population in the city, with just 2-3% medium sized enterprises and 7% large companies, mostly multinationals. Health coverage in Colombia has two categories. The first is the subsidized group, which represents around 60-70% of the population who are unemployed and cannot cover their own health expenses. Individuals who pay a percentage of their salary to cover their health costs constitute the second group. They ultimately pay for the health coverage of the subsidized regime. Taking this situation into consideration, and the geographical advantages of the city's location on the coast and status as a popular tourist destination and a hub for industrial activity, we decided that education was necessary to propel the development of the city. The goal is to transform Cartagena into a knowledge-oriented city with 30 universities. We believe it can become a logistics hub, a tourist powerhouse and an attractive destination for the banking sector. The ocean is another important resource, which is why we opened a marine biology program this year.</p><h4>In which faculties are you investing the most resources to encourage economic growth in the city and the region?</h4><p>We have developed the health faculty for which we built specific infrastructure with laboratories for developing biotechnology. The research will be focused on areas such as genetics, immunology, and pharmaceuticals, among others. The building will also be suited to providing medical services. The three main focuses for the health faculty are education, services, and technology, and we will also have start-ups. The new infrastructure will be able to accommodate around 3,000 students and will be opened in a month. We have also started a project to develop a dental clinic for our dentistry program. It will be around 10,000sqm, but our long-term project is to build a mega-hospital for which we have already purchased land. It will include an area which will serve as a free trade zone in addition to being a cluster dedicated to the manufacture of plastics, and this will be adjacent to the educational building.</p><h4>How is the process of internationalization developing at the university?</h4><p>We are a young institution and we believe we must establish the basic structures of the university first. We are improving the infrastructure in Cartagena and Bogotá and are planning to build a hospital and clinics. This constitutes the second phase of the internationalization plan. We aim to boost bilingualism in the region and foster an entrepreneurial culture, but the construction of a solid infrastructural base is important for attracting international students. The building will be inaugurated by the president in August, and it will mark the beginning of a new era for the university.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors underpin the growth of your company?</h4><p>The principle factor is our customer service and personalization. We are ready to provide service 24 hours a day. This industry is stressful, because you can have events starting at 7pm, but the set up for such an event could begin up to two days before and when the event ends at 11pm, we do not finish until the next day because we have to break down the equipment. Gauss Systems always stays with the customers.</p><h4>How does Gauss Systems help its clients to build a stronger image, and can you elaborate on the main services that you provide to your clients?</h4><p>Gauss Systems is a leading technology and audiovisual services company, both locally and regionally. We have a broad portfolio of several services in the event industry. The main service is rentals, and we offer support to hotels that do not have a qualified staff or expertise in setting up audiovisual equipment. The investment in this hardware is often prohibitively expensive for our customers, who turn to us for support. Another major activity that we are involved in is system integration. We have a department that is involved in systems sales, and we have engineering teams who make original designs for conference rooms, or audiovisual installations, like store displays video walls, as well as videoconference room systems. These systems are for sale and not for rental, and we have a special team who undertakes this work. We sell projectors, like any retail store, but they are for professional level, rather than home use.</p><h4>What is the current potential of the MICE segment in Panama and how do you capitalizing on it?</h4><p>Panama has great potential, and we have many companies offering incentive and corporate tourism who need high quality audiovisual equipment; we have worked with many companies that select Panama to host a major convention. The work that the government is undertaking to promote Panama as a destination is also helping us, because many large groups are choosing to come to Panama as their destination. We have branches in other cities, and some hotels in Panama, and operations in other countries, but these are less formal at this point in time. </p><h4>Are you planning to expand your business in the region? Which country shows the most potential?</h4><p>We started in Nicaragua, which has a growing economy, and we want to be the first to start in that market. People have asked me why we do not enter Costa Rica instead, but that country already has too much competition to my thinking. </p><h4>What is the importance of a qualified team in your business?</h4><p>Human capital is incredibly important, because one person cannot do it all, and on an average day we are working on about six events in Panama. The country has a problem with qualified people, because firstly, we do not have the right education programs to promote careers in this industry. Gauss Systems has to send people to Colombia or Argentina to take specific audio and video courses. We also provide a lot of in-house training, and our human resources team develops courses and seminars for new staff.</p><h4>What are your priorities for Gauss Systems for 2015?</h4><p>We want to grow and move from our current rented office. The company is looking for a larger space where we can centralize our operations and install a retail store to grow that area of our business. We already have a small retail store, see a major opportunity there that requires better facilities. There are an increased number of companies keen to purchase plasma televisions, switches, and other technical devices. We have four stores here—the rental store, the project store, the installation store, and the sales department, which handles projectors, plasma televisions, and so forth. Each segment has a specific characteristic and skill set, so the staff working in rentals cannot work in project design, for example, and we have to lead all the operations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Chamber positioned to support and foster the development of the mining sector in Panama?</h4><p>CAMIPA is the association of mining companies operating in Panama.  We have been working with the mining sector for over 20 years now. CAMIPA is currently pursuing a project due to enter operation by the end of 2017. Panama is rich in mineral resources and we are trying to get the government to invest further in institutional strengthening of capacities and improving legal framework, in order to reap the full potential of the economical, environmental, and social benefits. The Minera Panama mine will be operational in 2017, and will increase the country's exports by a wide margin. To put it into perspective, the exports of this one mine alone exceed the income of the Panama Canal. We also have additional projects in Panama, the development of which will depend on the success of the first project. That is why we have been working for more than 20 years to realize it. We are close to finalizing this phase of the job. CAMIPA is urging the government to make the necessary improvements and advance the legal framework, institutional capacities, and other moves that will create effective regulation and stability in the mining industry.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on the current legal framework? What kind of change should the government promote to enhance the attractiveness of the country, and encourage international investment?</h4><p>Panama's mining code was last amended in 1988, while our legal framework, despite being in place, has never been regulated. This is a major issue, and a challenge to remedy. Our regulations have to be modernized, with the code transformed into a modern legal instrument. Additionally, the legal framework would also determine the institutional capacity and create the institutional entity mandated with supervising the mining industry. Thus far, we have had a low category entity embedded in a multi-sectorial ministry as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The Ministry is engaged with imports and exports, and many other sectors of the economy, in addition to mining. Decisions appear to be 70% political and 30% technical in nature, which is not a workable scenario for the mining sector. The business is overly complicated as a result, and in the future, technical factors must precede political imperatives.</p><h4>The government has identified mineral reserves estimated at $200 billion. How are local and international players capitalizing on these huge reserves?</h4><p>If the government wants to encourage private sector capitalization, it first needs to open the mining sector. Instead, it has decided to wait until Minera Panama commences operations. This is unwise, given the government need to be adequately prepared to supervise this world-class project, not to wait until problems arise to react. Furthermore, there are more metallic and non-metallic mining projects to develop, the entire country has mining potential, but contracts are not being signed.  Companies had filled over 230 applications nationwide, but just seven contracts has been granted thus far. Many of those applications have been held up at the Ministry of Commerce since 1990, and 60% applied before 2000. The current system does not work in any sense.</p><h4>Regarding the $6 billion Minera Panama investment, what are the peculiarities of this project and how will it support the development of the sector?</h4><p>This project will make the mining sector the biggest exporter in the country. Minera Panama will generate more than $2 billion per year in exports of copper, gold, molybdenum and silver. The expansion of the Panama Canal will produce $1.5 billion per year. This demonstrates mining's ability to impact the local economy. That is also why many people are wary of the sector's place in the country. It will upend the current balance of power and influence in the national economy, and businesses here are entrenched.</p><h4>How do companies operating in Panama implement world-class equipment and technology to increase their exploration activities?</h4><p>We bring in exports to teach technical skills. For example, no company has constructed a large-scale mine here to date, whereby these specialized skills need to be taught. Locals wonder why companies bring so many foreigners in to train our workers. While there are welders working on the Panama Canal, mining requires completely different techniques for same job. Panama lacks the equipment to operate its secondary industry. We do not have large-scale manufacturing, as almost everything is imported. Mining will provide an opportunity for Panama to open up its secondary sector in the near future. By way of an example, if in the future there will be two or three large mines in operation producing substantial volumes of concentrates, this will ultimately lead to the establishment of a metal refinery in the country, which means that Panama will eventually export metals and transformed metals instead of concentrates. It could also catalyze local manufacturing, which confirms the true potential to be reaped. This will not be easily achieved however, as refineries require significant volumes of concentrates to be economical. And yet Panama rests at the center of the world, and if we do establish a refinery here, demand will materialize.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the story behind Seguros Confianza?</h4><p>We started from scratch and today are satisfied with what we have achieved to date. We have established ties with reinsurance companies that give us the necessary support to be a reliable and trusted insurance company. This also enables us to face all risks associated with the industry. Over time, we developed a comprehensive portfolio and have aimed to enter underdeveloped segments, such the low-income bracket. The low-income bracket represents around 70% of the uninsured population in Panama. This does not mean we overlooked other more traditional segments, such as industry and commerce. We have focused on response time in claim settlements as our true added value as a company. At the moment, there are 32 insurance companies in Panama and we have reached the 22nd position in the ranking with only three years in the market. Apart from that, our top priority is to be profitable as a company.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of competitiveness in the insurance sector in Panama? What is your strategy to gain greater market share?</h4><p>This is a tough market, and we aim at taking gradual steps to gain the trust of our customers. This is not an easy task, as there are highly professional companies operating in the sector. Ours is a small, but secure market. Key elements in this industry are knowledge and dedication to customers, as well as fast claim settlements. Therefore, our main strategy is to grow by promising what we can actually offer and nothing more.</p><h4>In what segments and categories do you currently invest the most?</h4><p>We target middle-class professionals and people starting families, who are most likely to purchase a housing unit, car, or other big-ticket item. We also have some interesting activity in the corporate segment, although it is not our priority. We have expanded activities in the medium to lower-income bracket through insurance products, such as vehicle insurance. We have also put much effort into e-insurance products, boosting online services, which enable us to be fast in providing an answer to our customers.</p><h4>Can you elaborate on your strategy to inculcate an insurance culture among Panamanians?</h4><p>The middle class has expanded in Panama, and with that we have seen more Panamanians purchasing housing units and accessing credit lines. We have worked together with banks to offer complementary services to their financial products, such as compulsory life insurance for mortgages and housing insurance. Seguros Confianza has also invested considerably in the promotion and education of certain products, campaigns, and the overall need and importance of insurance products. We also developed a strategy to offer accessible and affordable products and services. For example, for $5 a month, we offer a cancer-specific insurance that covers up to $50,000. We also offer many consultancy services to explain the benefits and opportunities to insure the entire family unit, for example. We have also seen that the insurance culture has grown in Panama alongside the rising number of expatriates relocating to the country.</p><h4>What is your geographical coverage?</h4><p>We have a presence in Panama City, as well an office in the central region of the country. We have plans for 2016-17 to open two additional offices; in Chiriquí­ and West Panama provinces, which have great potential for our demographic target. We also plan to increase our portfolio of alliances with financial companies in order to strengthen our presence and position in the national level. Our strategy also includes the broadening of our distribution channels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's background story?</h4><p>Tzanetatos Inc is one of the largest distributors of mass consumption products in Panama, with two in-house brands and other highly recognized imported brands. For over 50 years, Tzanetatos Inc has engaged in the distribution of the leading brands from several segments; food, personal care, cosmetics, household, and automotive, meeting consumers' diverse expectations. Over the years we have also diversified our activities to expand our horizons, and reduce our dependence on a particular market.</p><h4>How does the company support the development of the retail sector in Panama? </h4><p>Our two branches give us nationwide coverage for all product types. We also have a plant that produces cheese, butter, margarine, mayonnaise, mustard, sauces, and other condiments. We have installed state of the art machinery for both production and packaging. Overall, our offering is unique in this country; no one else can offer consumers the same quality and variety. This indicates how much we contribute to the development of the retail sector. At the same time, we serve some of the largest clients in Panama. For example, we provide margarine to Unilever and are the local sector leaders. </p><h4>What is the scale of your distribution network?</h4><p>The company has national coverage, supplying the various distribution channels such as supermarkets 100%, wholesale 95%, pharmacies 95 % and food services 95%. The company has its own fleet of 125 vehicles.</p><h4>How has the company diversified its business activity?</h4><p>Diversification has been a means of growing our business activity and curbing overdependence on any single economic sector. An example of this is when, a few years ago, we entered the construction sector. We built a seven-hectare shopping mall and three office buildings—two of which are about to be completed, with construction of the third to commence shortly. We also developed a Free Trade Zone (FTZ) that will host investors from diverse fields, and will include an assembly plant.</p><h4>What are some of the most demanded products within your portfolio?</h4><p>We have a wide range of products from several segments such as food, personal care, cosmetics, home, automotive, beverages, and spirits. In the personal care segment, we have body care products, products for babies, medicaments, and others. In short, we are the leading company in the sector. Some of the brands we represent are Disney, Lorenz, Quilmes, Isabel, Barbie, Academie, Hormel Foods, Hot Wheels, McCormick, Revlon, Samsung, and Surex. One of our goals is to provide products at more competitive prices, since supermarkets have strict requirements. We are open to establishing new partnerships with international brands in order to further build our portfolio and/or develop joint projects in sectors such as construction or logistics. Our company is looking to develop a maritime port with another partner, which would put us in a stronger position as a distributor.</p><h4>What are your main goals for 2015?</h4><p>We will open two new centers in order to improve our coverage and distribution network, offering products at more competitive prices. We will also develop other types of projects beyond our main business activities. I think the construction sector will play an increasing role in our overall business activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Ministry's strategy to promote and enhance social cohesion among Panamanian people?</h4><p>The current government presented its vision and ideas during the electoral campaign, though many thought that this was only propaganda. We prioritize social equity and development through high-quality education and enacting education reforms that have an impact on both students and professors; through integral and high-quality healthcare reaching even indigenous communities and all areas of the country; and finally through providing a higher quality of life to our people through environmental protection and sustainability efforts. When we took over, our first priority was to catch up as the Ministry and finish whatever remains to be done. We recognized the problems; inequality, poor distribution of wealth, and discrimination. Having said that, the Ministry's focus is on rural regions and on the autochthonous population. Other groups we have identified as high risk are youth, working children, and women. We are focusing on them, and we will develop strategies that will tackle the issues.</p><h4>Due to its position as point of crossing and center of transport Panama is a melting pot of cultures and races. Today do you still consider immigration an opportunity or a challenge for the country? </h4><p>Immigration, if done in a planned manner and with good controls, is a positive opportunity for Panama. We are a rather small country with a population of about 4 million people. Panama itself offers many opportunities and, unfortunately, we do not have enough people to make all of them a reality. However, the country has a lack of effective policies in this regard to make immigration an effective tool for development. The subject has been rather politicized over the years; some argue that it has become excessive, and now we are suffering the consequences. Immigration has already brought the country much in terms of qualified human resources, technological advances, and so on. However, it has also brought some new challenges. In light of this, we need to take action in order to give a legal and regulatory framework to immigration policies.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to create synergy with other national and international institutions?</h4><p>Since we have started at the Ministry, we have developed a social cabinet in which all ministries and main public organizations in the region take part to develop the social policies of the country. The policies are then ratified by the executive committee and finally the parliament. We have achieved a lot since the establishment of the cabinet, addressing social issues the country dragged their feet on for over a decade, such as the equalization of marriage age (18) and the creation of the interagency commission for the development of the Children's Code. We have also developed cooperation agreements with many social entities, such as national universities graduating qualified professionals that can join the workforce in a number of sectors. We have addressed illiteracy—Panama's literacy rate is at just over 94.1%, and we are developing literacy programs and establishing partnerships with the private sector in order to offer more job opportunities. Finally, we have signed social partnerships and agreements with the civil society and many international organizations, such as the EU.</p><h4>What are the main objectives of the Ministry for 2015?</h4><p>Our main goals for 2015 are centered around institutional reorganization, which has already been achieved in large part, the improvement of the impact of our social policies, and the development of an integral social protection plan for the entire country. We  willcontinue improvising social policies regarding social protection, especially when it comes to groups at high risk of exclusion. We will also make sure we develop first class care centers for newborns and children. In this context, our strategy is to upgrade the current centers and develop new ones. Finally, we will be taking steps towards the implementation of emergency and contingency plans in cases of natural disasters. For this purpose, we must organize society. We will also boost volunteering across the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you brief us on the jewelry and gemstone markets in Latin America?</h4><p>Let us first define Latin America from the perspective of the Panama Diamond Exchange. We are talking about a market that covers an area from Mexico in the north, encompassing the Caribbean Basin and traversing all of Central America and South America. It stretches over a vast area, including 20 countries and many islands, with widely divergent population groups. Latin America is a region rich in precious minerals and metals, and a result has a history of jewelry production stretching back literally thousands of years. But despite that, it is today considered one of the most under-developed jewelry markets on the face of the earth. More than two years ago we conducted a survey and discovered that the annual demand for jewelry and gemstones in Latin America hovered above the $8 billion mark. But with 8% of the world population, Latin America consumes less than 5% of the fine jewelry produced. On the one hand that indicates that it is performing way below its real potential, but on the other hand it show that there is room for tremendous growth. This is particularly the case where diamond-set jewelry is concerned, because there the region's market share is even lower. What is lacking in Latin America, when compared to other parts of the world, is a well-organized business infrastructure, which is exactly what we are creating in Panama with the World Jewelry Hub, which will be the first trading center in the region dedicated to the professional gemstone and jewelry trade. The Panama Diamond Exchange, the only recognized diamond bourse in the region, will be its anchor organization.</p><h4>What factors made Panama the prime location in Latin America to establish Panama Diamond Exchange?</h4><p>A variety of important factors provide Panama with a clear strategic advantage. Geographically it is located at the virtual midpoint of the Americas, and this factor is complemented by the presence of Panama's national carrier, Copa Airlines, which is the most connected airline in Latin America, and by Panama City's Tocumen International Airport, which is the most connected airport in the region. It can honestly be claimed that, in Latin America, all roads lead to Panama City. Panama is also home to one of region's most stable and prosperous economies, and it one that flourished, despite the fact that the population is relatively small. Its economic strength has been built on its status as both a regional and international logistics and financial services center, with the largest concentration of banks in all of Central and South America. Panama also has a dollarized economy, which is particularly important in the diamond and gemstone business, itself conducted internationally in US dollars. Panama's government has traditionally been business friendly, and from this perspective we have received strong support for our venture over the years. This was underscored by the government's declaring the area of the World Jewelry Hub a Free Zone, with no customs or duties on goods traded within its confines, and no tax on the profits of companies registered on its premises. And meanwhile, the attendance in person of the official grand opening ceremony in April by President Juan Carlos Varela further emphasized its significance.</p><h4>Panama has the second largest free trade zone (FTZ) in the world: the Colón Free Trade Zone. Why have you decided not to build Panama Diamond Exchange there?</h4><p>The economic environment in Colón is excellent, but it is a Free Zone designed to cater to merchandise coming through the canal on ships. This is not relevant to the diamond sector. Diamonds enter the country by air, meaning that a diamond exchange and jewelry-trading center would better be served by being in close proximity to an international airport. The World Jewelry Hub is situated just minutes away from Tocumen International Airport in the Santa Maria Business District, which is fast becoming Panama City's most exclusive business address. The trade also requires extremely tight security, with careful control over people and merchandise entering and exiting the complex. Furthermore, lighting and trading conditions need to be optimal. The World Jewelry Hub, home to the Diamond Exchange, is being built to the highest standards, and when complete will surely be the most luxurious and exclusive facility of its type in the world. Importantly, with the area of the World Jewelry Hub also having been declared a free zone, the gem and jewelry-trading complex today enjoys the same benefits and advantages as exist in Colón.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of being associated with the US based CROEM Inc?</h4><p>We partnered with it 10 years ago. It was one of the first Payment Card Industry (PCI) companies in the world. Now, Sigma is duly certified and thanks to the partnership with Croem we have our own development center and programmers. To process credit card payments, you require a license issued by the major credit card companies. We were one of the first private companies to hold PCI compliance licenses. Previously, this service was offered and performed by banks only, without the participation of gateways. We negotiated with a number of banks and ultimately received Metro Bank's support, and now our services are being catered to all clients.</p><h4>How would you assess the latest trends emerging in Panama's ICT sector?</h4><p>Technological development in Panama is attracting interest amongst investors. We have a number of professional developers in the workforce. Their technical skills are competitive, although certain other professional skills need advancing. It is important to give staff the opportunity for promotion and to further their careers. At Sigma, we are ardent about supporting our talent. We deal with delicate data here, such as credit card details; therefore, our employees must comply with the terms of trust contracts. </p><h4>How would you assess the competitiveness of the market in which you are operating? </h4><p>Our major competitors are banks. However, while they compete with us on price, they cannot compete on service. These are banks that offer this service without the intermediation of a gateway. For the banks, it is an add-on to their core business. For us, it is our business to provide the best service to clients. Our partnership with Metro is allowing us to offer that excellent service available to their client's as well.</p><h4>What is your strategy to widen your share in the market?</h4><p>We have to go on applying the best international standards to our operations and systems.  We do so through PCI licenses. They are the industry standard. PCI and DSS are the main licenses. When you comply, you are guaranteeing that all the transactions processed through your systems are viable and secure. If it isn't broken, don't fix it seems to be the general business model philosophy in Panama, where family-owned companies are common. Our main strategy is to challenge that way of thinking.</p><h4>Who are the most iconic companies and institutions that decided to work with you in Panama?</h4><p>We are processing all the payments for Cable and Wireless now. We are also processing payments for Movistar, ENA, and PanaPass. We provide services to a lot of SMEs that are our largest share of clients. SMEs make up 94% of the Panamanian economy. It would be ridiculous not to work with those businesses. There are also many self-employed workers in Panama. One of the product lines we develop is portable POS. People such as plumbers and electricians can charge via credit card, which previously was not available locally. The payment industry needs a bank to deposit the funds because by law we are unable to handle funds by/of third parties. We partnered with Metro Bank, our sponsor bank. Opening a bank account in Panama is difficult. With Metro Bank, we created a light account, or merchant account, which facilitates deposits directly. Money can be wired to the merchant account from regular personal bank accounts with ease. </p><h4>What are your main targets for 2015?</h4><p>We hope to close a deal with other telephone companies. We are also launching our payment collection site, Metropago. We are in negotiations with a company that holds collection contracts with public service companies and other private services. Additionally, we are launching the virtual side of that business to enable bill payment by credit card.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the importance for the country of the Summit of the Americas, and what are the main achievements that highlight the importance of this event from the economic side?</h4><p>The Summit of the Americas was an overwhelming success. All countries were invited, and, in particular, there was a dialogue between the US and Cuba. The summit was an important step toward real dialog between the parties represented. On the economic front, the summit was a showcase for Panama. It showed that Panama is a vibrant democracy, where all sectors of the economy are able to express their points of view and their potential. The different summits, the CEOs summit, the entrepreneurs' summit, the summit of the universities, and the youth summit, were all successful as well. The groups were able to reach consensus on several topics of critical importance to the region. We were able to show different American leaders what we have completed in the last few years, what opportunities Panama presents, and, most importantly, what we have accomplished. In the short term, the summit generated $80 million in economic activities. And while the short-term impact of the event is important, I would rather focus on the government's ability to demonstrate the results of our national development. During the summit, Panama attracted some of the most important CEOs and entrepreneurs in the region.</p><h4>What specific segments of the national economy are particularly appealing for international investors?</h4><p>Panama is blessed with an unrivalled geographical position, the logistics sector remains a pillar for the economy, and the airport has been developed by Copa. These are related to that sector and its attractiveness. Secondly, Panama is becoming a financial hub for the region and, over the next decade, we will become an energy hub, too. The new set of locks for the Panama Canal will allow the transit of larger ships, especially energy ships. The next development is to create an energy hub here.</p><h4>You recently led a delegation to Japan. What did you achieve during the visit and what is the importance of establishing synergies with the Asian markets?</h4><p>The local authorities have shown a remarkable interest in the energy reserves in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. The Japanese are looking to LNG supplies to fulfill their energy demands. We expect this market to grow in the next five years. Panama is a hub for Asian investments in the region. Tokyo, in particular, wants to move the discussion forward for financing line three of the Panama Metro. On that front, we were successful. I met with four different ministries in Tokyo, where we agreed on a timetable to complete the financing. In terms of synergies between Panama and Asia, Panama is the gateway for many Asian products. A number of Asian multinationals have their headquarters here. Panama will continue to support that in the coming years and now we are expanding the Canal, and with it the possibility of becoming an energy hub.</p><h4>How are you working to get the country removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list?</h4><p>Our strategy is simple. Panama agreed to develop a plan with FATF. In June 2014, that strategy was clarified and we are following that plan. The last step of the plan is the adoption of new legislation, during the last reunion with GAFI, Panama achieved an important milestone in the legislative field. The National Assembly approved several laws that will help Panama to be removed from the grey list.</p><h4>Can you share your priorities and targets set for 2015?</h4><p>As far as GAFI is concerned, our priority is to implement the new laws and to execute all the regulations for each of the industries. We have to support all the supervisors that will be in charge of monitoring all these entities. We want Panama's economy to grow, maintaining a stable and balanced growth in all the segments of the national economy, benefitting the citizens of Panama—especially the most vulnerable—promoting social and legislative equality. The execution of The Strategic Plan for 2015-2019, characterized by significant public investment, focuses on developing the social component of the country and on enhancing the basic infrastructures, and will help us to reach our targets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	The free trade zone is one of the largest in the world. How does it differ from the free trade zones of other countries?
</h4><p>
	The incentive of having a special economic zone that is considered extraterritorial from the country is tax-free transit. It is similar to other special economic zones; however, our unique characteristic is that we are located in close proximity to the Panama Canal and the vast volume of traffic it generates.
</p><h4>
	How is the free trade zone contributing to the development of the country?
</h4><p>
	We currently face certain difficulty in our dealings with Venezuela and Colombia. Panama, meanwhile, has become a hub, not just due to the canal, but also due to Copa Airlines and the fact it is a tourist destination for shoppers. Panama has been able to leverage the free zone across a range of sectors, which makes it such an attractive proposition. Free zone companies generally supply local stores and malls.
</p><h4>
	What opportunities are presented for the retail sector by Panama's new free trade agreements? What are the main trends in the sector?
</h4><p>
	What we see is the increasing use of the airport and the malls, and improvements in logistical capacity. KLM Air France and Iberia now offer direct flights to Panama, and Lufthansa will be offering the route shortly. Improvements in transport links makes shopping trips to Panama easily accessible. What better place than the free trade zone to be able to supply that demand. The trends are moving towards luxury shopping. Many of the free zone traders, whose sales decline in Venezuela and Colombia, establish shopping centers in Panama. Products in Panama are gaining popularity because of the more cheaper prices.
</p><h4>
	Is there any specific geographical area that you are targeting to expand your operations?
</h4><p>
	It is very difficult to replace countries such as Venezuela and Colombia who have over 30 million inhabitants. Other countries like Mexico and Brazil have their own difficulties with regards to imports. They are semi-closed economies. Difficulties arise due to non-tariff barriers when exporting to those countries. The challenge is to be able to wait out the situation with Venezuela and Colombia by leveraging our position as a shopping destination.
</p><h4>
	What kind of incentives do you offer companies to open shop here?
</h4><p>
	We provide the traditional incentives people have in free trade zones. Panama has a territorial view towards profit, so profits on sales outside of Panama are tax-free. There is a logistical advantage because of the fact that we are right next to the canal and a fiscal advantage because of Panama's treatment of tax on extraterritorial profits. That is the message. It is not anything special that nobody else has. However, many MNC's are unaware of our message.
</p><h4>
	How will the expansion of activities in the free trade zone affect and benefit the city of Colón?
</h4><p>
	One of the things that the new president has focused on is Colón. I see an opportunity in the near future, certainly this year, to establish the benefits that we have here into the city. If you imagine Casco Viejo in Panama City combined with Albrook Mall, a combination of a beautiful architectural city with the offer of a sophisticated mall. Colón in fact has more beautiful architecture present, though spanning across a wider area. This could be another retail outlet opportunity for the free zone traders who currently are in Panama, as well as other areas in Central America and the Caribbean. What we are hoping to do with Colón Puerto Libre is establish a public-private partnership. It is hoped the government will create incentives that attract risk capital from investors wanting to take advantage of the opportunity to recreate the city and restore it to its former glory.
</p><h4>
	What are your main targets for this year?
</h4><p>
	We are supporting the central government with its project to create 5,000 houses for low-income families, having donated a plot of land for the development. The government is regenerating the city for these low-income families. Curundu, for example, was a slum with raw sewage running through the streets and today it is a thriving low-income housing community where crime rates have declined. This project is coupled with Colón Puerto Libre. We want to bring the prosperity that is in the free zone into the city.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of development of the labor market in Panama?</h4><p>As a result of high economic growth (8% on average), all labor market indicators have been favorable. 96% of the workforce is busy, youth unemployment and informality has decreased significantly, while we managed to increase female participation in the labor force. While the dynamism of the economy has decreased, there have not been drastic changes in the labor market, among other reasons, due to the ambitious investment program we run between both the government and the private sector. The sustainability of economic growth is a key factor to generate decent jobs and is a priority for the Ministry of Labor and Workforce Development. We plan to strengthen the human capital program, for there is still a gap between the training offering and demand for skills by the productive sector. This affects the country's competitiveness and prevents the inclusion of a large segment of young people who have dropped out of the system and are embedded in the informal sector, many in conditions of vulnerability and insecurity. Another important task for this institution is to ensure that our workers enjoy better conditions in terms of security, access to adequate pay and their benefits are paid, as has been established in by Panamanian law. As part of a migration policy, we progress in a participatory manner in the design of mechanisms to allow for the orderly entry of foreigners into the country to fill the gaps left by the lack of training of local labor and that has been done more evident in light of the significant national growth in the last decade. </p><h4>What role does the private sector play in the development of qualified human resources in Panama?</h4><p>The private sector invests in schools in Panama, from pre-school to universities. In fact, of the 30 existing universities in the country, only five are public. On the other hand, the private sector, by law, is part of the Board of INADEH and includes three representatives appointed by the Council of Private Enterprise, an institution that is charge of approving all plans and programs of vocational training as well as other job skills program. The development strategy of the Ministry of Education is to offer students an education that reflects the realities of the working world. The Ministry also works with multiple chambers to coordinate efforts and prepare students to work in certain sectors of the economy. Bilingual Panama is a running program that foresees the training of 10,000 English teachers in the country, meeting the demand of the private sector. On the other hand, in face of the difficulties businesses face to fill jobs, especially in the technical area, INADEH is heading to training programs based on the needs of the private sector and with its dual training program, which allows students work experiences in companies.</p><h4>What are the objectives of the Ministry and its top priorities for 2015?</h4><p>One of our projects is the Pro Youth Program, expected to train 2,000 young people for the labor market. This will help improve the employability of this segment of the population; with the participation of INADEH, it is expected to develop a comprehensive training program designed to create the skills that the productive sector needs and increase productivity and competitiveness, while reducing the degree of informality in the labor market, which is 38.3%, although it has reduced since in 2005 when it stood at 46.6%; the number of inspections to ensure compliance with labor laws will increase by 10%; we work on the immigration policy in order to respond to the needs of specialized human resources, something the country still lacks. We also aim to modernize the facilities of the General Directorate of Employment and provide it with specialized human resources to ensure better care for visitors and better management.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main features of the financial market in Panama?</h4><p>The finance sector is a key player in the national economy of Panama, a country that plays a leading role in the region. Current figures and data show that this is a robust and solid finance sector. The sector has the capability of supporting the development of the country regardless of the fact of not having a central bank. In a way, this has been an advantage, for we have been a conservative sector and such an attitude has paid off. As there is no such institution developing monetary policies in Panama, this is something the sector does on its own. The non-performing loans ratio is below 1.2% in a sector with over 100 players and 49 banks having general licenses, figures unmatched region-wide. Having a well-capitalized sector is important within the current development perspective of the country. Growth expectations are highly positive for Panama. After years of fast growth, expected rates are higher than the region average, and certain players in the finance sector are growing at larger rates than the national economy. </p><h4>What are the challenges ahead?</h4><p>The ongoing globalization of markets and economies represent a challenge for developing countries such as Panama. Our standards have to be highly competitive in order to integrate fully into global markets. Our goal is to become the leading finance industry in the Latin American region. To succeed, we need to change the rules of the game. As we bring standards up to international levels and accommodate public policies, Panama looks to become a financial hub for the region, attracting investment from new players. YoY the Panamanian economy readily meets new challenges and implements more robust risk controls.</p><h4>How much is the bank investing in e-banking to improve the efficiency of its operations and consequently to enhance the quality of its service?</h4><p>Human resources and new technologies play a key role in our strategy. During the first 18 months of activity in Panama, we focused on having control over the operating platforms of Banistmo. In 2015, we started offering new services such as e-platform to our clients. Our strategy is to be more available to our clients wherever they are and to meet their needs. We continue working to innovate to provide the best solutions and services. </p><h4>As a leading universal bank, what specific sector are you targeting to consolidate your presence and to widen your share in the local market?</h4><p>We are a universal bank; therefore, we focus on all sectors. However, we now prioritize provision of services and products with high added value. For example, we are offering banking products to teenagers, and we wish to support their professional development and personal growth as clients of Banistmo. We also have high levels of market penetration in retail, however; there are still improvements that can be made in the SME sector. We have a strong sense of social responsibility and we invest in nature preservation. We aim at developing a sustainable business operation by promoting a saving culture amongst young citizens.  We are ready to work closer with all the key economic sectors in this country.</p><h4>What are your main short-term objectives?</h4><p>Our goal for 2015 is to continue implementing the strategy we set up last year; to continue supporting national development and the advancement of its main economic sectors such as construction, agribusiness, Free Trade Zones and commerce. Our target is to provide the support the country needs to keep improving its competitive levels.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the significance of the VII Summit recently held in Panama for the dialogue in the Americas?</h4><p>The immediate concrete result is that after 53 years, hemispheric dialogue is no longer exclusive. Finally, we all talk together, even if simply to comprehend our differences. That, after all, is what democracy and the equality of all states is all about. For years we have demanded that the embargo that isolated Cuba be brought to an end. The normalization of bilateral diplomatic relations between the US and Cuba is a courageous step toward this end that will allow for regional dialogue, indispensable in establishing a new framework for peace and cooperation for development. </p><h4>Latin America has a promising future, despite some uncertainties. What is the role of Peru in the upcoming years?</h4><p>Most Latin American countries have shown their financial and economic strength during this international crisis. Peru has stood out among them thanks to its fiscal and macroeconomic policies. They allowed us to have 16 years of continuous growth and to implement social policies that effectively fight against poverty. Peru will continue as a regional reference on successful economic and social policies. But also, as an attractive country for investors—with an enormous potential in different sectors—Peru will continue to receive investment from global and regional capitals, and show them the opportunities in our internal markets and as a center for regional activities. Latin America is widely known for the production of commodities, but now the region has to take a step forward and position itself as a region in a process of productive diversification. Peru has already been working on a National Plan of Productive Diversification to generate alternatives that boost economic growth and sophistication. In addition, Peru foresees that the Pacific Alliance is an opportunity to make regional economies more competitive and take advantage of complementary markets. </p><h4>The Pacific Alliance has emerged as a significant regional economic force. What are your long-term ambitions for Peru's place in the alliance?</h4><p>Nowadays the Pacific Alliance is in a very good moment. This alliance, as a whole, constitutes the eighth largest economy in the world, and represents the seventh largest exporting group worldwide. It attracts more than 40% of the FDI that flows into the Latin America and the Caribbean region. This, summed up to the results obtained to date, as well as to the tasks still in agenda, has attracted the interest of 32 observer countries from five continents, which makes us realize that we are doing things right. In the long term, I would like to see that the innovative initiatives that the Pacific Alliance is seeking to implement create positive results and serve as a reference to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean region. </p><h4>Peru has seen a decade of strong economic growth and declining inequality. What economic ideology has guided your presidency with regard to balancing foreign investment and domestic policy concerns?</h4><p>A focus on economic growth with social inclusion rests at the core. In this sense, private investment has been essential to achieving meaningful development outcomes that raise people out of poverty. Private investment has led to a higher level of salaries, household income and consumption, which has allowed an expansion of the middle class and a good performance in poverty reduction. For this reason, investment is actively promoted by the Peruvian government, both domestic and foreign. During 1H2014, 56% of FDI flows came from the reinvestment of profits, reaching high rates in sectors such as services (34.5% of total reinvestment), mining and hydrocarbons (32.7%), and the financial sector (15.5%). On the other hand, Peru has been ranked 35th out of 189 countries in the 2015 Doing Business Report, and second in Latin America. An important factor to highlight is that Peru has comparative advantages that attract investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate economic relations between both nations and where do you see the potential for further growth?</h4><p>Panama and Barbados have enjoyed long relations. Between 1904 and 1914 alone it is estimated that about 60,000 Barbadians came to Panama, most of them destined for work on the Panama Canal, with many more having previously come to help the French with their Canal project in the 1880s. Since then, the relationship has been close. So-called “Panama money," as it is called in Barbados, contributed much to the development of the country's wealth in the form of remittances sent back by Barbadian guest workers. We are currently trying to deepen that relationship. In 2010, we signed a double taxation agreement to bolster Barbados' vibrant international business and finance sector, as we see Panama as a very important partner in this. We are now trying to get our air services relationship solidified. I am meeting with the head of Copa Airlines in this regard, as there are currently no flights into Barbados from Panama. They have direct flights to many of our neighboring countries, therefore we hope to elicit some positive responses from them during this meeting and eventually establish improved connections so that Barbadians can easily travel to Panama. </p><h4>The VII Summit of the Americas took place in Panama this April. What would you say is its significance in the dialog between the Americas?</h4><p>This is has been dominated by the fact that it was the first Summit in many years that has involved the entire family of nations in this hemisphere, because Cuba agreed to join us too. It demonstrates the successful beginning of normalization between Cuba and the US. Barbados is very pleased about this of course, because we were one of the four nations in 1973 that took the bold step to decide that Cuba's isolation in the area had to come to an end. This is when we established diplomatic relations with Cuba along with Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Jamaica. We have continued to fight for Cuba's integration into the hemisphere as a legitimate member of the community, so you can guess how content we have been over the course of this Summit. We think that the interactions between the leader of Cuba and the US represent a great leap forward.</p><h4>Where do you see the future of relations between Barbados and Panama? </h4><p>I believe that the language barrier has separated us from one another. As such language barriers are broken down, all of the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean will come together. We are all working toward that, and Barbados is not going to be left out. We are seeing a deepening in the relationship between Barbados and Panama on a cultural level. Recently, I heard from Barbadians living here about how ingrained Barbadian habits and mores are in certain parts of Panama, including culinary habits. They are all present here, meaning there is hope for expanded cultural exchanges and for citizens of the two countries to get to know one another better. There is hope for a deepening of our economic relationship through tourism and international business and financial services. In addition, on a political level, we have a strong diplomatic relationship, and I believe that it is only a matter of time until Barbados establishes an Embassy in Panama and vice versa.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama City has recently hosted the VII Summit of the Americas: how would you assess this international event regarding the creation of a fruitful dialogue between the nations of the Americas?</h4><p>We have now been able to position Panama as a mediator, as a country that tends to help and resolve disputes. Unfortunately, we had moved away from that position during the past few years of the previous government, and now we have regained this position whereby we maintain good relations both with the US and with the leading countries in the region; we have good relations with the countries that form the Alliance of the Pacific, we enjoy good relations with the Caribbean countries and we have regained a strong foreign policy position as a country that allows us to act as a problem solver in the hemisphere, and must recognize in this connection the leadership of President Varela and the Vice-President and Foreign Minister Isabel de Saint Malo de Alvarado. Establishing dialogue is fundamental, and a part of the government's new vision. </p><h4>This year marks the beginning of the government's 2015-2019 strategic plan. What are the Ministry's key medium-term priorities?</h4><p>There are several core programs currently being run by the government. The current administration wants to guarantee the adequate supply of drinkable water in 100% of homes in the country, replacing the so-called latrines in all of houses. We have already initiated that program. We have also initiated a social housing program called “Roof of Hopes," which is designed to solve the housing shortage. Private constructors tend to enter high-end, medium-end, and lower-middle developments, but are less involved in social housing. We are also involved in the renovation in the city of Colón, and will soon have a public bid to contract for the building of 5,000 public residential houses. Colón has been plagued by high unemployment and high crime rates, so we are making these investments to reduce both. We are sure we will achieve all our targets. We are also working hard to expand the Metro in Panama City, which will run from the central part of the city to the eastern part, near the airport. We are also already conducting studies for the building of line 3 of the metro, which will run from the city to the west side of the canal to urban areas there. This will also involve building a new bridge over the canal, and will widen the existing highway from Panama City to six-lanes. Those are the two primary megaprojects to be built in the near future. The expansion of the Canal will be hopefully be completed by mid-2016, and will obviously increase the opportunities of the logistics sector, and this entails a new port on the Pacific Coast. </p><h4>What is the government doing to boost foreign direct investment in the country?</h4><p>Foreign investment is welcome in any sector. The previous government passed a law in which the majority share in maritime services had to be owned by Panamanians. We repealed the law, and now foreign investors can engage in maritime services to make investments in the Panama Canal. That is the first step we took in that sector, and there are more than 100 multinationals active today in Panama with regional headquarters in the capital. We are promoting a new law to increase the number of international companies in Panama, and are in discussions with the Colón Free Zone to enhance their logistics capacity and offer a free zone to investors in Panama. It is important to note that we are actively combatting corruption and actively promoting the rule of law, because the first requirement a country has in order to attract foreign investment is the rule of law.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In a rapidly changing world that is increasingly interconnected, education more so than ever before, is the ladder of opportunity. And that is why the expansion of educational opportunity has, from the beginning, been a central focus of the Summit of the Americas. It is why President Obama launched 100,000 Strong in the Americas to increase the number of young people from the region who are studying in the US, and the number of students from the US attending universities in the region. It is why, in Panama, President Varela launched the Panama Bilingue program, which sends more than a thousand school teachers annually to universities in the US and the UK for professional training. When we gathered in Panama City for the Seventh Summit, we found ourselves encouraged by the progress achieved. We also found ourselves determined to close existing gaps, and are today more aware than ever that we will either go forward together, or else fall behind together.</p><p>In country after country, the people of the Americas have strengthened their democracies and taken steps to ensure the fundamental freedoms of their citizens. And in many, democracy has brought not only freedom from fear, but also freedom from want. Over the past decade, the economies of Latin America and the Caribbean have grown at an annual rate of 4%. Incomes are rising, and the middle class is growing. Moreover, the gap between the rich and poor—though still far too wide—is narrowing faster than in any other region.<br>In our era, we wake each day to a new world. We have to move forward constantly just to keep pace. We also have to hold people in public office like myself accountable. </p><p>We all know that education is a lifelong process. And yet it has to begin in the earliest days, and correctly. Globally, one of the Millennium Development Goals has been to ensure that every child is able to attend primary school. Enormous progress has been made in that direction, and in our hemisphere, primary school attendance is now nearly universal. </p><p>At the 2009 Summit of the Americas, the US launched its Scholarships for Economic Growth program, which provided $50 million for 1,300 students from Latin America and the Caribbean to enable vocational training in the US. President Obama's 100,000 Strong in the Americas initiative builds on that effort, and the results speak for themselves: Already, more than 72,000 students are coming to the US each year from Latin America and the Caribbean.</p><p>America is investing in cleaner alternatives. Since President Obama took office, the US has upped its wind energy production threefold. We have increased our solar energy generation more than tenfold. Our country has become smarter about the way we use energy in our homes and businesses. And all of these examples represent major steps.</p><p>Here in Panama, extreme weather events are creating cycles of flood and drought; events that are threatening the water supplies that enable the Panama Canal to operate effectively and generate electricity. Just a few years ago, due to a record storm, the canal had to close for the third time in its 100-year history, disrupting one of the world's most important economic thoroughfares. In Peru, where I attended the climate change conference in December 2014, tropical glaciers and fisheries are under threat. The rise in sea levels contributes to the erosion of Puerto Rico's coastline around Rincon. And coral reefs are at risk from warming waters and ocean acidification. The number of major hurricanes in the Atlantic basin has increased repeatedly, which damages tourism. </p><p>We can encourage governments, businesses, and consumers to rely less on costly fossil fuels. That means increased investment in mass transit systems, and in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and sustainable hydro-power. We can push for the world's highest standards in the environmental chapters of the trade agreements that some of us are pursuing, and that includes the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which will build prosperity throughout our hemisphere, based on shared principles and shared values. IT is not just a technical trade agreement. The agreement is a strategic opportunity for all, and an opportunity we need to seize.</p><p>So here at the dawn of the 21st century, at the seventh Summit of the Americas, I hope we will overcome stereotypes and not fall prey to cynicism, but rather make the most of this extraordinary period of innovation, entrepreneurial activity, and individual opportunity. And I have great faith in the Americas' ability to lead the world in doing so.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I had a chance to visit the Panama Canal for the first time and saw the extraordinary progress that is being made in the new development that will be completed next year. This project is a symbol of human ingenuity, and also of Panama's central role in bridging the two continents and bringing the hemisphere together. I congratulated the President not only on the success of the Summit of the Americas, but also on the extraordinary progress that Panama has made economically, and the transparency and accountability that his government has shown. Panama is a proud democracy, and its ability to engage in elections and peaceful transferals of power is a symbol of the progress that has been made throughout the hemisphere over the last several decades. As President Varela noted, we are great partners on a whole range of issues—security, the economy, and education—and we had an excellent discussion about how we can further deepen those ties. So, we are very appreciative of the great friends that we have in the Panamanian people. </p><p><span></span>Our goal was to make sure that we had concrete actions that would improve our economies, the opportunities for our people, and security in the region. This is very important to the US, not just because of proximity, and not just because our neighbors here are very close by, but because we have incredible bonds as people. There are Americans who make enormous contributions to our society every single day who come from Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Belize, and all the countries that are represented here today. And so we have ties of family. We have ties of commerce. We share incredible heritage and incredible history. And so it is important for us to make sure that the US stands in solidarity and has a partnership with each of the countries that are represented around this table. Since the last time we met, it has been the goal of my administration that we find ways to concretely assist the countries in Central America so that people in those countries feel that they have opportunity and development. That is in our interest. We know, for example, that criminal elements and narcotics trafficking thrive where people have no other pathways to success. If we can make sure that they feel that their efforts are rewarded in their own countries, then we are going to be much more successful with the security arrangements and coordination that we are involved in. The issue of migration does not just affect the US, it also affects the countries in the region themselves. And the more that people feel that they can find opportunities, raise families, and be successful where they live, the less disruptions there are and the less tensions there are at our borders. As a consequence, I have requested $1 billion in the new budget to support US engagement across Central America. Some of these dollars would be designed to strengthen regional cooperation on security, but some, as President Varela and I spoke about during our bilateral meeting, will be dedicated to human development—education, providing young people pathways to success, and focusing on what is happening at the community level. The US is very excited to work with you to find what you think will be most effective path forward, and then to have a coordinated process moving forward in order for us to succeed. Regional integration on issues such as energy, electricity, and improving trade flows can all be incredibly valuable for the region as a whole, and ultimately will be valuable for the US as well.</p><p><span></span>We continue to believe that part of the regional agenda should focus on governance issues and transparency. And we are in a city right now and a country that I think has done an excellent job on many of those fronts and, as a consequence, the high growth rates in Panama should serve as a useful example for so many countries not just in this region, but also around the world.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>I thank the Panamanian people for having given me the opportunity to serve them. I thank my government and all public officers for continuing to work daily for the nation. I will always guide the country to achieve the common benefit of all Panamanians. I thank the National Assembly for approving all the projects aimed at improving the life and wellness of our people. I want to share the achievements of my government and the challenges we have ahead to advance together as one nation in the search of our full potential. We are the same healthy, peaceful and honest country that lives in this beautiful land washed by two oceans, full of prosperity and where civilizations meet. Today, we are a country very much different from that of a year ago. Since the Panamanian people gave us their support, the country has a government highly committed to transparency, and respectful of the separation of powers, freedom of expression and human rights. This is a government based on dialogue that aims to reach consensus and serve Panamanians. Permanent dialogue will be the main tool to address all social scenarios we might face. I repeat what I said on my first day in office; I am the president of all Panamanians and we lead the country under a single flag. We live in a new era in which social peace, tolerance and justice are the main ruling elements in a country in which nobody is above the law. Politics today, aims at the development of society with a united vision for the country. The government develops all its projects with social criteria to meet all social needs regardless of political color. We respect democratic values and human rights. We celebrated our 25th anniversary of the restoration of democracy and we must take the necessary steps to make sure it continues strengthening and developing. In the early and mid-1990s, our democracy was ruled by other values and it was weakened as a result. Today, it is founded on the constitution and the laws of the country, in true values and the hard work of many people aiming at the social wellness of Panama. Public life in the past was characterized by avarice, and the political pursuit of wealth. Those days are over and Panama is united for beneficial development, and we seek out those who abused public funds. We have a justice based on fraternal correction. As president, I am not focused solely on judicial matters, but I will do what it takes to defend my people, Panama, and their equity. Our administration will continue to focus on developing our government plans and projects, supporting justice and the Public Ministry in their efforts to bring forward these processes. We need to preserve the peace and work together to further develop our democracy. I will do whatever it takes to unite this country.</p><p>Over the past year, we have strengthened our democracy with an honest government open to civil society. Our achievements are those of the entire country and its people. This has been a difficult year, where we have faced challenges from the past and pushed forward many projects. This was aimed at realizing our government plan to benefit all Panamanians. We have seen salary increases, inflation is under control, and the price of food has not increased. We have achieved great development in the agricultural industry with a comprehensive portfolio of services, credit lines, consultancy, and technical support. In terms of security, we advance in two directions; prevention and fulfillment of the law. There are over 4,000 teenagers taking part in the Safe Neighborhood program, which has already generated excellent results. Homicides have decreased by 25%, but this is not enough for me; Panama and its people deserve lower criminality levels. To achieve this, we need the support of all Panamanians, and need to reach core family values to do so. We also need to tackle drug cartels and dealers, and encourage teenagers at risk to make the correct decisions. Our goal is to become the safest country in the Americas. We will achieve it with the support of all the social actors in Panama. This year, we have indicted over 25 criminal gangs and will continue to apply a firm hand in this regard. We also promote the social inclusion of those at risk. We encourage teenagers to respect the rule of law, while we strengthen our security forces. We also increased synergies between all security bodies and institutions of the country.</p><p>In terms of housing, we advance our plans in Colón; we have several ongoing programs with 14 work fronts. With “Hope Roofs," and have realized over 5,000 housing units and have over 25,000 units out to tender. In terms of our basic health program, we reached over 30,000 households through Conades. By the end of the year, we want to have doubled this figure. We have designed a two-way strategy; the strengthening of the water treatment plants network, drilling deep wells and have developed a contingency unit for emergency situations. <br>We have also initiated a national health census to better understand the current state of our people and the health needs. The initial results of the census reveal that around 40% of Panamanians suffer from hypertension or diabetes. We need to promote a healthy life style in society. That is why we will invest in expanding sport facilities across the country. We will also invest in prevention and build new hospitals, the Children's Hospital among them, as well as refurbish and upgrade several other hospitals.</p><p>In August, we will see new developments for the construction of the Health City. We want these facilities to host the new Oncological Hospital as well as the new Medicine Faculty of the University of Panama. I call upon all health segments to come together to work hand in hand for the development of the sector and the benefit of the people.</p><p>In terms of cleanliness, we have allocated a budget to renew the fleet of garbage collectors in all municipalities of the country, investing also in the entire treatment plant network nationwide. Regarding transport infrastructure, we will build Line 2 of the Panama Underground and are holding talks with the Japanese government regarding technical and financing support for Line 3. This year we will also tender the project for the bridge over the Panama Canal. We will soon announce the new Metrobus project, which will become a public company managed by the government. We will provide a secure, efficient and reliable service to society. <br>We also created the Public Infrastructure Coordination Unit in order to strengthen the technical capabilities of the government to tender key projects of national interest. This unit is assigned to the Ministry of Public Works. For example, we tendered the Aguas Frias-Yaviza highway with a budget of $150 million and an extension of 102km, benefiting 48,000 inhabitants of the region. It will contribute to the incorporation of the region to the production unit of the country. We will tender many other rehabilitation and upgrading road infrastructure projects.</p><p>We committed an annual $400 million investment budget for the support of pensioners, increasing, among other things, their pay, and the support of vulnerable communities.</p><p>The private sector also supports us in the plan to rehabilitate public schools. In the first stage of the program, 100 schools will benefit. This means over 200,000 school children, around 30% of Primary School system students. We have also identified several other projects within the education system for a total budget of over $1 billion. Among these we intend to build 10,000 classrooms and 50 new secondary schools. Additionally, we provide training opportunities abroad to our teachers through a Bilingual Program, whereby 1,300 teachers have had the opportunity to travel to the US, Canadian and British universities to improve their language skills. We also need to strengthen tourism as one of the pillars of our economy. We will soon launch a promotional campaign under the slogan “Panama Unites the World", focusing in our three main markets; the US, Latin America and Europe.</p><p>In terms of foreign policy, Panama hosted the 7th Summit of the Americas, which was preceded by four international forums; the Forum of the Rectors of America, the Entrepreneurship and Business Forum, the Diplomacy Forum, and the Teenager Forum. We achieved a re-launch of hemispheric relations, especially between two countries that had no relations whatsoever for 50 years, Cuba and the US. We focused on mutual respect regardless of political system and took important steps in the process of tackling common regional problems. The Summit provided excellent proof of our commitment to dialogue and problem solving within our foreign policy strategy. I lead a government that respects international law and is highly committed to the transparency of our financial system, which has implemented several actions to fight money laundering. We will never allow for any country to harm the image of Panama and label us with inappropriate tags.<br>For our second year in office we have several projects we want to develop such as Colón's Maritime Port and the effective coordination of the national health system network. We will also change certain elements of the political system and the funding of electoral campaigns in order to boost transparency and the election of civil representatives. I make a call to all local authorities to take active part in the dialogue to boost the decentralization of the state. We propose for this dialogue to be based on transfer of competences, a solidarity formula, and strengthening of management capability. In general terms, we have an average growth rate of 6%, we have reduced the country's fiscal debt, increased cash availability and savings, and are set to increase investments, which should further boost our economic growth rates. Meanwhile, we aim to become the first country in Latin America that eradicates child labor. Overall, we have carried out our investments of over $4 billion and those projects will be completed in a short period of time. Let's move forward all together for the benefit of our country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate the performance of the company in 2014?</h4><p>Meyer's keeps growing and we are keeping busy. In terms of the maritime division, this year our company brought in another four tug boats, two in the Pacific and two in the Atlantic. Our expectation was to grow by 5% for 2014 and we're expecting 7% this year.</p><h4>What impact will the expansion of the Panama Canal have on your core marine business?</h4><p>We are in the process of purchasing two or three more tug boats because conditions will change. The port requires more power for post-expansion vessels and we expect to have these at the beginning of 2016. This expansion represents a great opportunity for everybody, and we will increase profits and expect to have a good 2016.</p><h4>Meyer's Group is a diversified company with several branches operating in several sectors of the national economy. Which one is driving your growth?</h4><p>Traditionally, the core of our operations is in the marine business. On top of this, we have recently started investing in agriculture, mainly in dairy and agricultural products. We are developing another project, specifically a farm in Chiriqui province. It is under construction right now and there are large investments being made at the fiscal stage of the project. We are receiving support from Banvivienda, a bank that is supporting all of our projects, including the agriculture focused ones. We are working directly with a local farm on the production of pork, which is expanding production with an increase in livestock from 500 to 2,000 heads this year. We are making improvements on the success it has achieved already, and we want to invest and develop this sector in Panama. We view this project, and all of our agricultural projects, as long term. Our strategy is to develop our agriculture projects as this is going to be the most necessary development within Panama. There are still a significant amount of imports and the country is growing every day. There are millions of tourists coming to the country every year who expect good food, but we are still importing these products. The government is starting to restrict imports and is providing more support to the agriculture sector. Agriculture in the country needs to be improved; farms are still using technology from 20 years ago. Now we are bringing in technology and higher quality animals to the agriculture sector and this is the future of the country. The same thing applies to alternative energy and we need to focus more on this in the future as well.</p><h4>Panama City is growing and many companies are capitalizing on the construction side. How are you supporting the development of this sector?</h4><p>The construction business is gaining power in the company. Our construction operation has been moving mainly in other areas such as Panama City was not interesting in the past because there were a lot of companies already in the marketplace. We are actually now becoming established in construction in the city as the big players are now moving to other countries. Construction is still growing but it is not like two years ago. There is still a lot of construction inventory on the market as there are a lot of new buildings in the area. Panama City is good enough already on construction, so the growth will be outside of the City in other areas of the country. Chiriquí­ is one of the most interesting developing areas of the country right now. On the infrastructure side, we were involved in the construction of Line 1 of the Metro and we are involved in the new highway to Chiriquí­. We are working to support this operation while we await the plans for the expansion of the metro. We worked with the transportation department on the main construction and fully expect to be involved in Phase II as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2015 marks the 100th year of activity of the Chamber of Commerce. What was the philosophy behind the creation of this institution, and what are the milestones achieved here over recent years?</h4><p>The Chamber of Commerce was established in 1915 as an initiative designed to enable businessmen to meet and share common interests in the private sector and to develop businesses after the canal was opened in 1914. Ever since then, the Chamber has played a significant role in the private sector. From time to time, it has been involved in the fight for democracy. Looking back on all that we have done, there have been many presidents who were members of the chamber. We played an important role in the coup d'etat in 1968, and also in the cessation of the dictatorship in 1989. It was also the chamber that led the opposition in 1989. After that we assisted the new government in restructuring and rebuilding our economy. The private sector is now a vital force in Panama, and the nation has been one of the leaders of the past 10 years in terms of GDP growth, and the highest ranking in Latin America. We have a dollarized economy, which is stable, and also attractive for overseas investors. Panama has great connectivity through its airport, and our most important asset is the canal, which was handed back to the Panamanians in 2000. Ever since, the Panamanian government has been a great example of good management and sound investment in the economy. As a private entity we have grown with over 1,800 members today. We are divided into 15 groups or sub-chambers, with every chamber representing a different sector. We have coverage of industry, construction, and development, cars and motors, pharmaceuticals, law firms, advertisement agencies, human resources, education, logistics, and transportation, to name a few. Each sector is represented here, and each sub chamber has between 150 to 200 members. We have good representation on all of the important topics and sections of our economy. </p><h4>What does the chamber do to protect its members and widen its memberships?</h4><p>We offer many services through the chamber. We also have a legal department, which revises every law and initiative on the legislative and executive levels for the private sector. We are vigilant that none of these initiatives impair the security of business and the way we do businesses. We want to protect the private sector, and organize five to six expositions a year. The most important multi sector exposition is Expo Comer, which has been held for the past 33 years in March. We have representation and commercial exposure from over 30 countries and buyers and suppliers form abroad are also in attendance. We also instigate trade between other countries with which Panama has close relations. We also have expositions for the tourism sector, as well as the technology sector and medicine and health. Foreign nationals may also come to Panama and join our chamber. We also provide a medium for arbitration between members, and we are also leaders in social responsibility. </p><h4>What advantages does Panama offer to the international community of investors?</h4><p>We have the highest international direct investment rate in Central America. We have attracted close to 45% of the international investments in Panama and Central America, and we are doing a good job in that regard. We have the connectivity of the canals, and among the Americas, which makes it easy for foreigners to come and see what we have to offer. We enjoy political stability, and the economy, too, is one of our assets. Meanwhile, a convention center is being built, for which we have high expectations. The center will attract international multi-sector conventions to Latin America. The international business community will have greater scope to look to Panama, and perhaps establish a presence as a result. We have over 100 multinational organizations established here in Panama, which speaks to our potential. These companies have their regional offices here, and benefit from special treatment, while their investments create jobs. Our unemployment rate is the lowest in Latin America, and with employment comes peace, progress, and a great quality of life in the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Unique in the Field]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[unique-in-the-field]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your investment expertise and the type of investing activities that Rasameel focuses on?</h4><p>We are licensed both for banking and investment banking. We do asset securitization, sukuk issuances, structuring, arrangement, placement, capital restructuring, and investment advisory. Our activities are largely focused on the debt-side of things—debt capital markets and debt instruments—rather than equity, and we are the only company in Kuwait that has such a specialization. Most investment companies in Kuwait do asset management and equity trading, but we are unique in our field.</p><h4>In 2014 and 2015, Rasameel was awarded Best Islamic Structured Finance House in the GCC. What makes you a leader in your field?</h4><p>It is our focus and our specialization in being an asset structuring house that sets us apart. Banks lend their balance sheets and underwrite according to their lending and credit criteria. Our budget is about KD100 million, which is relatively small when it comes to lending activity. Where we come into play is putting together structuring capability so our clients can respond without burdening their balance sheet. We do off balance sheet funding based on the strength and the quality of their assets and cash flow. Companies are used to going to banks and borrowing to create assets. We buy the assets off the balance sheets, creating equity for them so they can continue doing their business. We acquire portfolios of receivables and leases. We like income-generating assets so we aquire them and sell them in the form of investment instruments that give annuity. That is the kind of different approach that we have at Rasameel compared to the rest of the market.</p><h4>What is your criteria when it comes to targeting the type of clients that you work with?</h4><p>We go after clients that have income-generating assets, namely consumer asset companies, auto leasing companies, aviation, and companies that have long-term contracts of supply, such as contracts with the government over a period of 3-5 years. We can put financing packages around that stream of income because it is predictable. That is what we go after. Our investors on the other side are mainly institutional investors, sometime banks, and those who are looking for income generating assets rather than putting their money away and waiting for it grow. People aspiring to make huge gains would go for private equity, but our side of the business involves more calculated risk with manageable predictable yields in the range of 4 to 7%. Certain clients like to invest in such products because their capital is relatively secure and they have an identifiable source of income that will generate for a period of three months, six months, or a year; they like to play it safe.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the sukuk market?</h4><p>Mainly for consumer financing companies because they have an ongoing need for funding. They are willing to do mudharabah sukuk and musharakah sukuk. There is a growing trend for green sukuks, sukuks that go into funding environmental friendly projects, which is basically directing funding toward an ethical part of the economy. It falls under the same structure as either wadiah, musharakah, leasing, or mudaraba. Our commercial paper program for alghanim, which won an award for innovation. We then bought on their behalf on a third party basis, and they deferred all their sales to our account with a yield up to a certain limit. Anything over and above was their profit. They made a huge profit without having to commit their capital. For the investors, they were happy to see the cash coming in and the short-term nature of the transaction for the client. They were happy to see an increase in sales and, notwithstanding that, they were getting a substantial amount of profit at the back end, because we only took 7% and the balance was for their account. It is win-win for the client, for the investors, and for us.</p><h4>Do you foresee an increase in the utilization of Islamic finance principles from non-Muslims in the near future?</h4><p>Sharia law does not discriminate between people according to their faith. Under sharia law, gambling is not allowed, unethical activities are not allowed, and profit should not be exorbitant, because it is limited to what is the norm and it is pretty much flexible. Two non-Muslims can transact according to sharia; there is nothing to stop them if they find the profits suitable. If the Prophet (pbuh) was transacting with non-Muslims that means that it is pretty much open and it is universal. A substantial number of the sukuk issuances in the Malaysian market are for Chinese-owned companies, because they find it as an efficient market, cheaper, and some times there are tax benefits when using sharia structures as opposed to normal conventional structures. In the 1980s we started to see Islamic finance companies investing in the US market because they were never allowed to invest in international equity. Sukuk means a joint ownership stake in an asset. So the projects are two-tiered, the first tier is tradeable paper, which is called sukuk stock; but the second tier, which is at the transaction level, is totally different when it comes to leasing and musharaka. These are totally different products; one is leasing and the other is partnership. So that is why it is a dual-level structures, with applications on many different structures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zenith Bank is now among the top banks in the world. How has your philosophy as its founder driven the institution's investment?</h4><p>Zenith Bank is simply built on the core values of people, technology, and service. A super synergy between these values has been the backbone of Zenith Bank from inception to date. Zenith thrives by attracting excellent people and putting the right people in the right places. Zenith Bank staff receives the best training available, which has helped to build a strong corporate culture of goal-oriented activities. By the continuous training of our staff and exposing them to best practices in all aspects of banking, our people are empowered to be creative, innovative, and, at the same time, operate at the highest level of efficiency. All these have contributed to a stable and highly motivated workforce in Zenith. As a result of the training and exposure we give to our staff, we have been able to innovate, create, and lead a banking revolution in Nigeria, leveraging cutting-edge technology. Our practice at Zenith is to continually seek ways of improving existing banking practices while constantly challenging benchmarks. The combination of highly motivated staff and state-of-the-art technology produce excellent customer service, which has been our point of distinction within the Nigerian banking landscape. Our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers over the years has made our bank attractive to major businesses home and abroad. As a result of being satisfied with our services, our customers have rewarded us by being our ambassadors as they continue to market us and give us references. This has challenged us to continuously seek ways of making our customers happier. This partly explains why Zenith's markets share of the Nigerian banking business is on the increase.</p><h4>Zenith has been a standout bank since it was founded. How has democracy enabled enterprise in Nigeria?</h4><p>As a Bank that believes in putting the right people in the right places, Zenith has, since inception, attracted and retained seasoned professionals in all areas of our organisation. This has helped Zenith to build a reputation of a compliance conscious bank, which has made it easier for us to work with governments at all tiers and the several regulatory agencies in Nigeria and other countries. Naturally, democracy has helped us to grow as a bank by enhancing confidence and encouraging entrepreneurship. As a Nigerian bank with international footprint, we have supported and will continue to support the programs and policies of government in jurisdictions we operate. As a reward to our conscious efforts on compliance with laws and regulations, and support of government programs, we have received significant support from government in Nigeria and outside and we will continue to work cordially for more support. The consolidation exercise that resulted in having big Nigerian banks has enabled Nigerian banks to compete comfortably with other banks in the world. As players in the banking industry, we expect the new administration to continue to support the growth of Nigeria banks as this helps the banks to create jobs, wealth, and expand into other countries.</p><h4>Zenith has a UK subsidiary, and this year opened a branch in Dubai. What degree of international expansion is appropriate for Zenith, and how has the prevailing macroeconomic situation at home and abroad affected your assessment of expansionary moves?</h4><p>Zenith is continually seeking opportunities to expand and tap into profitable business ventures at home and abroad. Dubai is actually a branch of Zenith UK. Despite the seeming global economic downturn, there are numerous untapped business opportunities especially in Africa and Asia, which Zenith is watching closely.</p><h4>Payment systems are a significant development in East Africa, and are gaining momentum in West Africa and Nigeria. How do you plan to integrate them into Zenith's business model?</h4><p>Yes, you're right, especially if you look at what M-Pesa by Safaricom is doing with mobile money transfers. As a technology driven bank, Zenith has been at the forefront of process automation and championed several projects that resulted in the adoption of electronic banking. Zenith has deployed several platforms that have made banking services seamless and more efficient for customers. Using technology to facilitate payment has always been an integral part of Zenith banking model and with the CBN's drive for cashless Nigeria, Zenith will continue to work with other stakeholders for a more efficient and secured payment system.</p><h4>The CBN has tightened monetary policy in 2015 by imposing FX restrictions on certain imports, a move that some analyst predict will cause inflation in the long term. How have monetary conditions affected Zenith's business, and what, in your opinion, is needed to stabilize the market?</h4><p>This is a brilliant idea. Oil prices have plummeted by almost 50% since September 2014 and have recently dropped to below $45 per barrel. You know as well as I do that the Nigerian economy is overtly import-dependent and this has led to significant loss of foreign exchange. Therefore, the imposition of FX restrictions on certain imports would not only help in foreign exchange management by saving the country FX haemorrhage but would also help in promoting local industries with its attendant spill-over effect on employment generation as well as wealth creation. The current monetary condition is a fallout of dwindling oil prices and drop in government receipts. The implication is that the CBN is not able to meet all the FX needs of every customer. However, Zenith is coping very well with the current situation by FX rationing to meet the needs of our customers while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.</p><h4>The banking system is a key piece of Nigeria's future, but SMEs still have difficulty finding capital, and only 32.5% of Nigeria's have access to formal financial systems. What key policy changes in the public sector and strategic changes in the private sector could result in great access to financial services throughout the Nigerian economy?</h4><p>Access to finance is no doubt challenging especially for SMEs because of high interest rate due to high-cost of sourcing deposits. However, that circumstance is gradually changing since the introduction of various intervention schemes, particularly the Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Development Fund (MSMEDF) with single-digit interest rate by the CBN. It is expected that funding for SMEs will be more accessible than it used to be.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The outlook for the remaining part of the year is bright given the public confidence in the current government since government policies affect businesses to a reasonable extent. Nigeria, being the biggest economy in Africa, is the preferred investment destination for everyone looking to maximize their return on investment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[On Trend]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[on-trend]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What global megatrends has PwC identified and what are their implications?</h4><p>The first of the five global megatrends is demographic and social change. By 2015, we will have added another billion people to reach about 8 billion, with the over-65s the fastest-growing group. But there will be sharp regional variations: Africa's population is projected to double by 2050, while Europe's is expected to shrink. These demographic changes bring risks for businesses that fail to respond adequately. </p><p>The second megatrend is the shift in global economic power. On current trends, the aggregated purchasing power of the “E7" emerging economies—Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey—will overtake that of the G7 by 2030. The global emerging middle class will represent an annual market of some $6 trillion by 2021. Businesses have to address the needs of ever more diverse—and more demanding—customer segments. The ongoing rebalancing of global economic power also brings major implications for investments in infrastructure. Worldwide, we estimate that annual spending on infrastructure will grow from $4 trillion in 2012 to more than $9 trillion by 2025—with a total of close to $78 trillion expected to be spent globally between 2014 and 2025. </p><p>The third megatrend is rapid urbanization. Every week, some 1.5 million people join the urban population, through a combination of migration and childbirth. Rapid urbanization brings major implications for businesses as they refocus their offerings, marketing, and distribution towards and increasingly urban customer base with distinct needs and consumption habits. </p><p>The fourth megatrend is climate change and resource scarcity. As the world becomes more populous, urbanized, and prosperous, demand for energy, food, and water will rise. But our planet's natural resources to satisfy this demand are finite. Business must take the lead in mitigating environmental damage and tackling climate and resource challenges, while simultaneously striving to make their organizations more agile and resilient. Corporate responsibility has evolved from a “luxury" to a business imperative. Ultimately, sustainability is the lens through which every business will be judged by its consumers, workforce, society and even investors. </p><p>The last megatrend is technological breakthroughs. In our latest Global CEO Survey, business leaders told us technology is one of the biggest disrupting forces in their organizations. One aspect is that the time it takes to go from breakthrough technology to mass-market application is collapsing. The price of new technologies is falling equally rapidly. At the same time, digitization via the internet has created extraordinary value, as exemplified by Google. And social media is steadily strengthening its position as a dominant force in the day-to-day lives of people across the globe, enabling many of the world's top brands to capitalize on it to deepen their relationship with customers. </p><h4>How do these translate into Ecuador's economic environment?</h4><p>Countries like Ecuador, very well positioned in terms of agribusiness and other natural resources, could take advantage from this, being an important food supplier for the world, as the population will be added another 1 billion by 2025. On the other hand, rapid urbanization, climate change, and resource scarcity are important challenges not only for Ecuador, which will require infrastructure investments and doing business in a mega sustainable fashion. Ecuador is a beautiful country with a variety of natural </p><h4>What opportunities will these megatrends bring to enterprises?</h4><p>We are finding that our clients are targeting two core sources of growth: the consumption power of growing population segments and the innovative potential of a diverse workforce; another opportunity is global mobility as the number of people being assigned by their employers to roles beyond their home country has increased by 25% over the past decade and we project a further 50% rise by 2020. Emerging markets will challenge developed economies in the production of high-end consumer durables; today's “F7" frontier markets—Bangladesh, Colombia, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, and Vietnam, will become tomorrow's growth markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Grand Hotel Guayaquil recently completed its renovations. What have been the main changes and how will they benefit your guests?</h4><p>Being the largest traditional hotel located at the heart of Guayaquil, we share an entire city block with the Cathedral and are a few steps away from the famous Seminario Park, where hundreds of Iguanas can be admired by visiting tourists. We are in walking distance of the Malecon 2000, a 2 kilometer-long path along the Guayas River, where visitors will find local restaurants, bars, and shops offering souvenirs. And of course there is a spectacular view of the river, where boats provide tours. Because of our hotel's ideal location, we initiated a total interior and exterior renovation, with a $3.3 million investment spanning two years. All of our 183 rooms have been totally upgraded and a new elevator now serves from the basement to the Terraza Racquet Club, were we have a 650sqm sports complex with two squash courts, a fully equipped gym, sauna, steam bath, massage service, and a large social area. Our pool area also has been renovated, featuring a 4m-long Iguana made by a local artist, surrounded by tropical plants. Our 24-hour coffee shop, where we serve our buffet breakfast and a traditional executive lunch buffet has also been renovated, as well as the Turtle Bar, where we serve our welcome cocktail to our guests. The 1822 restaurant is undergoing renovation. </p><h4>The Ministry of Tourism plans to undertake 30 tourist projects by 2017 with an investment of $1.6 billion. What will be the greatest challenges in boosting tourism activity in Ecuador?</h4><p>In short, we need more flexible labor laws and friendlier legislation in order to attract and guarantee foreign investment. </p><h4>The improvement of hotel infrastructure has become a priority for the government in order to optimize and broaden tourist capacity in Ecuador. What is your outlook for the hotel industry, and more specifically in Guayaquil?</h4><p>We expect that demand for hotel rooms will be satisfied with the existing hotel capacity in Guayaquil, totaling approximately 750 rooms. New hotels are already under construction and others are announced to be built, and set to open between 2016 and 2018, totaling a further 1,275 rooms, bringing the total deluxe and first class hotel rooms available in the city up to an approximate 3,475 rooms.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recent establishment of the Convention and Visitors Bureau in Guayaquil?</h4><p>By the end of December of last year, Guayaquil's Municipality created the Municipality's Official Tourism Enterprise, presided by the former Tourism Director of the Municipality, Gloria Gallardo. Guayaquil's Convention and Visitors Bureau is created under the wing of this organization, receiving partial financial support from the deluxe and first class hotels through a tourism tax charged to guest accounts. The tax will guarantee part of the needed budget for the bureau, which is already affiliated with the International Convention and Congress Association (ICCA). The Convention Bureau's objective is to consolidate the city of Guayaquil as a specialized destination for conventions, congresses, and fairs. The city is well-positioned to serve as a hub for business tourism due to its the excellent year-round climate, its airport facilities that received annual international awards for best airport in its category of South America, and that are recognized as being among the best worldwide. The city also has excellent hotel services to offer, gastronomic variety, and of course our tourism highlight for pre and post tours, namely the Galapagós Islands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[All You Need Is Ecuador]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-you-need-is-ecuador]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the partnership with National Geographic in the World Legacy Award emerge?</h4><p>We are pleased with this partnership, and the reason we decided to partner with National Geographic for the award was that we share the same vision and values regarding sustainability. We have a progressive perspective on tourism and sustainability, and we approach this by recognizing that sustainability and profitability are not mutually exclusive. We decided to partner the publication for the first time this year and were the first recipients of the award. It is a promising development for tourism in Ecuador. We were also delighted that the Ecuadorian company Tropic Journeys was recognized for their involvement as well. </p><h4>How do you evaluate Ecuador's current position in terms of ecotourism?</h4><p>Today is a great moment for Ecuador, especially as the government is recognizing its role in the social and economic development of the country. Ecotourism is increasingly being perceived as an important source of jobs and income. It is also important for the value chain, especially considering the size of the country. According to the World Economic Forum, Ecuador is among the 25% of countries who have the highest growth potential in tourism, due to its natural and cultural characteristics. Ecotourism is one of our greatest sources of potential because of the sheer beauty of the country. It is also a major responsibility because tourism is a long-term undertaking, and we understand that we want to increase not only the quantity of tourists, but also the quality and length of their stay here. Our goal, after all, is to generate revenue for the country. </p><h4>Have you seen any direct results from the “All you need is Ecuador" campaign so far?</h4><p>We are very pleased because the campaign shows how much tourism has advanced in the country. It was launched last year, and we decided to sustain the promotion activities because of its success. We have already noticed consumers starting to recognize the "All You Need is Ecuador" campaign. Last year we ran a spot during the Super Bowl, broadcasting a 30-second edition of our three-minute commercial, which proved highly positive, doubling our social media impact. Currently, we are measuring the impact in terms of the free press we are receiving. If we had not advertised during the Super Bowl, we would not have appeared in places such as Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, or the New York Times. Everyone was talking about Ecuador because it was the first country to broadcast during the Super Bowl. We expect to see an increase in visitors this summer, which is the high season for the market. On May 14th, Ecuador launched the second phase of “All You Need Is Ecuador" campaign, an effort that continues the legacy of the first-ever foreign-sponsored Super Bowl ad. We committed $9 million of a $28 million global budget to an integrated marketing campaign in the US, including TV, print, online, and public events in New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Florida, and California. The message is that Ecuador, with its plethora of topographies, people, climates, and experiences all packed into a small geographic cornucopia (you can visit the Amazon, the Andes, the coast and, conceivably, the Galápagos islands in one day). As a result of these actions, Jet Blue, a low-cost airline, announced its intention to serve the route Fort Lauderdale-Quito-Fort Lauderdale. American Airlines has noticed rising demand for flights to Ecuador and is changing one of its planes for a larger one on its Miami-Quito-Miami route.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the demographic of your student body?</h4><p>We currently have 28 different career programs with a total of just under 6,000 students. Very few of them are foreign students—most are Ecuadorians. We are trying to increase the amount of foreign participation through various programs, mainly temporary student exchanges, typically over a semester or a summer, depending on the field of study. We have a number of exchange programs with universities in the US, such as Kutktown University and Taylor University, mostly in the field of medicine. We've also just begun exchange programs with universities in Chile and Colombia. </p><h4>What partnerships and joint programs do you have with universities and institutions within Ecuador?</h4><p>We have various partnerships and programs with universities, companies, municipalities, regional governments, and also regional university institutions. These are mostly training, research, and technology-transfer programs. In Cuenca we have various partnerships with local government, municipalities, and companies, mainly in terms of the practical application of solutions and technologies for their respective needs and purposes. Some of the more important companies with which we have links are the local electricity company Centrosur, the Provincial Council of Azuay, and a kitchen producer, Fibracero. </p><h4>Azuay's medical program has been recognized for its quality and rigor. How important is this for Azuay? </h4><p>We are very proud of this, because it's a relatively new degree at Azuay, with just ten years behind it. But we have observed over those ten years that we have been on the right path, and that the investment we made was well justified. What we operate here is a veritable hospital, and we've worked closely with the medical profession and the private sector to staff and run the hospital. It's a rigorous course that requires academic, research, and practical experience with a very demanding entry and selection process to the program. Of 800 applicants, we'll accept 45. So we're very proud of what we offer, and that our medical school has been recognized for its quality and excellence. </p><h4>What are the biggest and most important investments Azuay will have made by the end of this year?</h4><p>This year we have to complete the construction of a new floor at our Medicine Faculty, which will be mostly for labs and will allow us to expand the school so we can receive more students. We also plan other structural and physical additions to expand our campus and cater to new and increasing needs. </p><h4>What developments do you expect to see in the higher education sector in Ecuador in the long term?</h4><p>The new law in higher education brings about some fundamental changes, which our university supports and has been making the necessary changes according to what is required by the new law. However, there is very little time given to make the necessary adjustments to this new law, and that has been challenging. We're expecting and hoping for some flexibility on the part of authorities in this regard. But all in all, I believe the higher education system is headed in the right direction. </p><h4>Do you think some further regulatory and legislative changes are needed to improve the new restructuring?</h4><p>Yes, and it is important for the law not to be amended by each successive administration, but that the law remains consistent regardless of which government is in power, or what its policies may be.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The company was created in 1989. How have you diversified and generated added value in your production?</h4><p>We began by solely selling our broccoli in bulk packaging to the industry so that at the final destination it would be repackaged, or combined with other products. Today, we are packing it directly for the end-user, depending on the requirements that each client asks us to fulfill. A key step involved diversifying into the organic market, and today all the new products are directed to this market, and we are not only growing organic broccoli, but also spinach, kale, Swiss chard, and quinoa; today, around 35% of our total volume is organic. This is a big step, because it implies that our fields have to be organically managed and have to be certified under sustainable agricultural standards. </p><h4>How strong is your international presence?</h4><p>We export 100% of our production. Our exports are divided as followed: 35% to Europe, 35% to 40% to the US, and 20% to Japan. Our original market was Europe—we have had a presence there for 26 years. We have had a relationship with the Japanese market for 20 years, having worked closely with very few, though prestigious, Japanese importers. In the US the story is similar, but we have also introduced our new organic products, and so we have had to find more clients who are specialized in this line, and that is something that has worked very well, now it is more of a problem of supply than demand.</p><h4>How do you think the EU-Ecuador trade agreement will affect the Ecuadorian broccoli industry?</h4><p>On paper it is going to help us maintain a competitive edge because we will not be paying any duty; the duty for broccoli is high around the world, both in Europe and the US it is almost 15%. If there is no Free Trade Agreement with Europe we would be 15% more expensive, which is not doable for broccoli; it is a commodity, it is a vegetable, and the margins are not that big. With the Free Trade Agreement we will be able to continue business as usual, and we will be on the same level playing field with our global competitors, which are essentially Mexico, Guatemala Spain, Portugal, Poland, and China. Ecuador has also recently been included by the US for the extension of the Generalized System of Preferences, which will immediately boost Ecuadorian exports for around 3,000 products, as all import duties will be eliminated</p><h4>What will be Provefrut's biggest investment this year?</h4><p>We diversified in bioorganic quinoa, a healthy food segment. That was finished last year and came into production this year, in our new production facility called Proquinua. The investment was over $1 million. In total, we invest around $1.5 to $2 million annually, and we have been doing so for the past six to eight years. Where we normally want to invest is either in replacing older equipment for more efficient ones and production capacity growth at our 3 production plants.</p><h4>What is Provefrut's prospect for the year ahead?</h4><p>We are expecting 5-7% growth this year. This year we will come close to over $50 million in sales, and I would say the gross income will be around 8-10%. We ship about 35 to 40 reefer containers per week, which is a lot of volume and logistics. Last year we saw growth of around 15%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors have contributed to your growth over the years?</h4><p>Our company has been in the construction business for over 35 years, manufacturing asphalt membranes for water proofing systems. We started as a small business and are now one of the most prominent businesses in modifying asphalt in all Latin America. Our products are now exported to markets outside Ecuador and that has been one of the main reasons for our growth, our involvement in international markets. </p><h4>How are you diversifying your product portfolio?</h4><p>We have implemented two major changes. As I mentioned, our initial product line was modified asphalt for waterproofing purposes, but a few years ago, we began using this asphalt for pavements, road construction and maintenance. All roads in Ecuador are now being improved, which has been a new market in Ecuador, separate from the segment we initially entered. We are now also diversifying into heat and noise insulation. </p><h4>Has the government's investment in roads and highways affected your growth?</h4><p>At first, we were not dependent on state infrastructure projects, and in fact I would argue that it was our growth that influenced the development of infrastructure. The government began to use the asphalt we were promoting, instead of local unmodified product. Our asphalt also has a component that makes it elastic, so it's harder to break. Highways sustain a considerable impact from vehicles and require asphalt that with shape memory, which is why the government today is using our asphalt for all infrastructure, buildings and highways.</p><h4>In what other areas are you investing your resources?</h4><p>At the moment, the chief investment has concerned our new plant. We have relocated our infrastructure from a plant of 10,000 sqm to one of almost 50,000 sqm. Furthermore, we are planning to open the first Imptek beyond Ecuador in Colombia in mid-March if everything goes to plan. We have been exporting for 15 years, but this will mark the first time we establish ourselves as a known brand in another country. </p><h4>What is Imptek's export profile?</h4><p>We have been exporting our products from Mexico to Chile and the Pacific Coast. The international market represents 30% of our current total sales and we expect it to account for 50% within the next five years. Last year we saw a marked decrease in our sales to Colombia as the Colombian peso was devaluated to Ps2,400/USD, as a result of which Colombia lacked the financial muscle to import products from Ecuador, or in fact anywhere but Europe. We faced aggressive competition from European products. Despite Ecuador's strategic geographic advantage concerning exports to Latin America, we still face high costs in transportation, especially over land, to Colombia and Peru. </p><h4>What are Imptek's plans for regional expansion?</h4><p>The infrastructure we have at the moment demands we go to bigger markets. We are currently at only 50% capacity in this new plant. We have a strategic plan to search for markets in the US, Mexico, and Brazil. We are always looking in America and hopefully one day we will go to Asia. We made an effort to introduce our products in Spain, but there are a lot of competitors at our same level there—it's not the right moment. If the Euro goes back up, we could do business with our products. </p><h4>What is Imptek's goal for 2015?</h4><p>In 2015, our main goal is to produce at a capacity utilization rate of at least 70% at the new plant. We have started at 50%, and adding that 20% would enable a rise in sales of over 50%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Which of the air, maritime, and land business lines are most preferred by your clients?</h4><p>For clients with large volumes, maritime is the obvious choice. You can ship a lot more and for much less. In terms of which industries predominate among our clients, there are diverse sectors and industries represented, but we deal with many textiles and clothing companies, be it primary materials or finished value-added products. We also deal with machinery, white goods, and so forth, where every type of merchandise requires different procedures and time frames, and has different logistical needs. If there are no customs restrictions or tariffs involved, we can get everything through the port and on its way in one day, but it depends on the goods we're dealing with. </p><h4>How important is IT in your operations?</h4><p>It's all about the IT. With logistics operations as complicated as they are today, this can only be done with a solid information technology infrastructure. These processes can take weeks, even months, and you're dealing with paperwork, bureaucracy, physical transportation of goods coordinated across different lines of transport, going through different juridical and political zones with different customs laws and tariffs, and you have to meet your client's expectations to get it there on time and in the right place with everything intact and undamaged. So without a solid IT base, you'd be lost. This has enabled us to be a one-stop shop for our clients, so they only have to deal with us and leave the logistics in our hands. </p><h4>How have certain trade restrictions affected business?</h4><p>This is especially seen in the textiles and clothing segment, as various different tariffs and quotas apply there in different categories. We've seen that our clients are easily discouraged by this, and our country reacts by shutting its own doors to trade, unwilling to tackle the issue except in a knee-jerk way. We at Seyrema are of course in the middle of it all, but we too are affected when our clients are affected. I think it's important not to act desperately or in a knee-jerk way, but instead to take one's time, analyze the situation, make the necessary diplomatic or political interventions, and come up with a strategic plan accordingly. This goes both for our own government and for companies engaged in foreign trade, who can take certain measures as well. For example, instead of shipping or exporting things in large volumes, they may have to do it in small batches, using smaller ships or containers. </p><p>Protectionism, import restrictions, and tariffs are a challenge, but instead of fearing these and becoming pessimistic, companies and governments should consider them obstacles that can be overcome, not just through trade practices and mechanisms, but also in terms of lobbying their own governments and foreign government. Trade restrictions are always essentially a political decision and it's up to the government and the relevant ministry to try and reestablish an equitable balance in trade between two countries. These have always been a factor in international trade and always will be, so we have to work this into our strategic planning instead of thinking of this as a crisis. </p><h4>What's your strategic plan for this year?</h4><p>We're focusing on synergy this year. We have to take time to analyze the situation, and the recent import restrictions and protectionism have slowed things down. We've been around 15 years and we've seen all the highs and lows, so we consider this period to be a fortunate one, because we can take stock and chart our path forward accordingly. The aim, as always, is to continually grow. We want to work with our clients and our customers to try and find ways to diversify and find solutions to various trade restrictions. Companies have to think creatively, diversify. The government has to be proactive and dynamic. If there are restrictions and anti-dumping legislation affecting clothing producers and exporters, they have to find ways to overcome it. If you just stay rigid and refuse to adapt and innovate, you're not going to last.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Yobel decide to come to Ecuador, and why? </h4><p>Yobel came to Ecuador 45 years ago, and from the outset, our goal has been to be a regional player with the support of our partners. Our strategy has been developed with BELCORP, a strategic business ally. We offer outsourcing in supply chain management in 13 countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and the US. We first came to Ecuador because one of our partners wanted us to drive their expansion. Our first services in Ecuador included warehouse and door-to-door distribution, and 13 years ago we began offering direct sales services. </p><h4>What services does Yobel currently offer?</h4><p>The company has gradually expanded to include commercial activities of the sector. Our top priority is to support the expansion and growth of our customers through the services we provide: distribution, warehousing, goods monitoring, assembly and packaging and promotion. Currently, Yobel works with 12 companies in Quito and Guayaquil. </p><h4>What are the largest companies working with Yobel?</h4><p>All the companies we work with are integral to our business, as they have each taught us lessons about the local market. We lead the assembly and packaging activity for Colgate and Pronaca, and we distribute for Nestle and Kimberly-Clark. We support these latter two customers with warehousing services in Quito and Guayaquil. We provide warehousing for 4life, and are currently in discussions to launch a partnership with Cerveceria Nacional, which would represent an important step forward for our business volume.  We also work with Calzacuero supplying warehousing and distribution. It is standard for customers to come and go, but these customers represent our main focus and activity.</p><h4>In your opinion, which economic sector offers the greatest opportunities for Yobel to consolidate its activities?</h4><p>For a developing country, BELCORP offers considerable potential in terms of volume. In this context, we are interested in working with high-volume mass consumption companies such as Unilever. We would also like to expand our partnership with Kimberly-Clark. In terms of food and beverages, we are nearing the closure of a deal with what we believe to be the largest, most attractive partner we could work with, Cerveceria Nacional. </p><h4>How would you describe the supply chain management of Yobel?</h4><p>Yobel provides this service to Peru and Mexico predominately, though we work with companies from India and the US to implement supply chain management as well. We support the entire process: import/export, customs clearance, production, packaging, etc. This is the kind of supply chain management Yobel offers to its customers. Our aim is to incorporate more services into our portfolio and be a 4PL service provider.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Yobel's development in 2015 and onwards?</h4><p>For us, 2015 has been an interesting year in which we saw great development in the assembly and packaging segment that has opened doors and led to interesting business opportunities. It is difficult to talk about overall volumes for 2015, as it depends on the production segment being discussed. We expect to close the year with several new customers. In terms of direct sales, volumes have slightly decreased, but if we look at mass consumption volumes, assembly and packaging and distribution, we will close 2015 with a 22% growth compared to the previous year. This is due to our efforts to diversify our business portfolio. As for 2016, we aim to continue growing and creating more direct and indirect job opportunities for Ecuadorians. It is a great country to invest in and the workforce is highly skilled, hard working, creative and has a growing talent pool among graduates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

At that time, the company was poised to be sold for $16,000. However, we reverted the entire situation, going on to generate income of $42 million in 2013. At the beginning of 2007 Licentiate Roberto Cavanna took over and has been the main driver of our success since then. He managed to earn the trust of all Ecuadorians through a highly secure postal system and nationwide service, which has become one of the best postal services in the entire region. We also have, for example, a CCTV network at all branches and a control center with the latest technologies, as well as three different software programs to track parcels and packages. We are the most secure Ecuadorian logistics company and we are even able to detect narcotics in parcels. </p><h4>What have been the company's main projects and objectives over the past two years?</h4><p>I took over in October 2014 and since then my main objective has been to implement initiatives to decelerate the global decay of postal services and recover from that 25% decrease in turnover. However, this is a challenge. For example, we started providing new logistics services to our customers. We currently perform the distribution of all books and school uniforms for Ecuadorian public schools, which consists of almost 16,000 schools, amounting to 32,000 tons of books. For this service we have two logistics centers in Quito and Guayaquil, which together exceed an area of 10,000sqm. We have plans to open a new warehouse in Manabí­. Another project we have coming up is the distribution of induction cookers, with some half million units in the initial stage. Among our main competitive advantages are logistics capacity, human resources, and synchronization, which put us at an advantage compared to others participating in tenders. </p><h4>How would you assess Ecuador's transport infrastructure today?</h4><p>It has its pluses and minuses. For example, we have an excellent road infrastructure network. However, we still cannot reach the entire country. Road infrastructure currently reaches 85% of Ecuador's population. There are problems in the logistics market, and a rather small transport offering. For example, it is difficult for me to find trucks to provide full service to our clients. I believe that this tendency is now changing, but most logistics companies are obliged to have their own fleet with all the costs this implies. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the logistics sector for the coming years? </h4><p>It is extremely hard to make a forecast of how business will develop in two or three years' time. At the same time, we have many interesting opportunities ahead of us. For example, one of my main immediate wishes is to start airfreight services to the Galápagos. Nevertheless, another problem facing the logistics sector is the limited storage capabilities and air and road transport offering. I also want to launch maritime transport between the islands.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>YachayTech opened its doors in March of 2014. How has the university developed over the year?</h4><p>We have consolidated the university, and currently have 640 students living in YachayTech dorm rooms. All of the lecturers and professors hail from top universities, and all hold a PhD or equivalent according to the Bologna Act. We have opened the Institute of Technology for new professionals in dual programs in collaboration with the German government, the University of Berlin, and the Technical University of Berlin. We hope to have consolidated our infrastructure for the first stage of the project, which is the 280 ha Science and Technology Park, and by September we will have opened two centers of technology to accommodate more than 10 companies in the ICT field. We have acquired a data center set to be the most advanced in Latin America in the field of processing. We also have consolidated a residential area for administrative and academic staff, and for people coming to live in Yachay City of Knowledge, such as employees from industry. We are now the first center of science and technology in Ecuador, with publications in indexed magazines and books specialized in science and technology, including 50 publications between March 2014 and July 2015. We have realized numerous collaborations with research centers in the public sector, other universities, and the commercial area of the enterprises that are associated with Yachay City of Knowledge. We have organized more than 20 seminars and academic events during the year, with more than 400 scientists associated with Yachay City of Knowledge. There are over 650 entrepreneurs associated with Yachay City of Knowledge, collaborating with our Innopolis incubator. </p><h4>What accounts for the growing entrepreneurial community in Ecuador?</h4><p>Considering that social and economic behavior is such a large part of the economy, you almost have a tangible sense of the entrepreneurial spirit in all economic activity. This stretches far beyond the quest for accommodation, to sharing resources toward broader economic progress. The way to increase quality of life is to facilitate the utilization of better technology to improve the productive process and implement best practices. It's a matter of transferring adequate technology to give those working in industry a high value chain in the production process. Right now the challenge for Yachay City of Knowledge and the science and technology system is to boost productive processes. For example, agriculture and ICT are merging to transform activities for precision agriculture. Small business owners are doing better business just by opening new sales channels such as e-commerce and selling online. </p><h4>The total investment in Yachay City of Knowledge from 2013 to 2017 will exceed $1 million.What other investments will materialize this year?</h4><p>We are optimistic about the construction of six plants in the pharmaceutical industry, in cooperation between the public and private sectors. More than $260 million will be invested in basic services in Yachay City of Knowledge to improve their services and complete the urbanization of the park. We are bringing online three optic fiber backup networks in each site in Yachay City of Knowledge. In terms of private investments, in Yachay City of Knowledge we have 27 companies working with us, such as Telefónica, Cisco, and Indra, for a total of more than $20 million, and also with the Chamber of Industries and Production, and the textiles industry where we are developing a project valued at $5 million for innovation labs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the process of negotiations for 4G technologies between the government of Ecuador and the private sector?</h4><p>This government has set the pace for an aggressive negotiation process for 4G. These negotiations have been well structured and all main parties have taken part; we have been the driving force throughout the entire process. We reached a global pre-agreement last October and ever since we have been formalizing everything under the main regulatory frameworks and public bodies. The final and official agreement was reached in January with that the formulation of key legislation, and we are now in the process of implementation. We have already granted licenses to operations—Movistar and Claro for example. There has been a great deal of interest from the main international operators in obtaining an operational license. This has been a long process for all parties and has generated $330 million for Ecuador to date; the Ecuadorian government has long been investing in network and technology for the implementation of 4G technologies. This also means an improvement in the national network and in service quality for all Ecuadorians.</p><h4>What are the competitive advantages of Ecuadorian R&amp;D and how can this sector contribute to nationwide efforts to change the production matrix?</h4><p>Ecuador offers numerous opportunities for R&amp;D, especially in terms of the shift in the production matrix. Ecuador has huge agricultural potential and is a leading international exporter of certain products; R&amp;D can make this, and other potential sectors, still more competitive, increasing their technological threshold. Certain challenges lie ahead and to cope with them we first need a large consumer base with internet access. The ITC sector along with R&amp;D has a key role to play in changing the national production matrix. We are in the process of aligning ourselves with the government's strategy and contribute by making sure that more Ecuadorians have internet access, improving services in fixed telephony, and investing in key segments of the sector, such as education, to boost future development. 4G technologies are therefore a key component in our efforts to contribute to the development of the ITC sector</p><h4>What have been the main changes the telecommunications law brought into the sector and the country as an overall?</h4><p>It created a clearer regulatory framework for all parties involved in the sector, providing the operation basis for operators, and stimulates the sector as a whole. It has also eased up the licensing process for operators; operators today know the benefits and rules of the game. The law also provides support and protection to consumers and sets a clearer understanding of rights, duties, and fines for all parties. The new regulatory framework in the sector represented a turning point in Ecuador's ITC industry. For example, the law now foresees several levels of fines for operators and today a sole regulatory body monitors and implements regulatory policy. All this is vital in such a fast-paced changing industry as ITC, a sector that will drive the growth of Ecuador and its economy in the near future thanks to its flexibility, and within this context, the new law is a key step. One of the challenges ahead of us is to increase broadband penetration in Ecuador, and we aim to offer a $10 per month service to broadband users and consumers. Clearly, a larger number of internet users would also make a positive contribution to the software development industry. Meanwhile, the country is currently engaged in the implementation of a national cloud system that should become the basis of all of the abovementioned developments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What differentiates DIRECTV from other operators in Ecuador?</h4><p>We are a peer television operator focused exclusively on our TV business. Other operators usually have paid TV, fixed lines, and internet components. They have three businesses they can bundle. We have one business and so we have to be good at technology, service, and content. </p><h4>How does Ecuadorian television compare to other countries in the region?</h4><p>The most notable difference between Ecuador and other countries in Latin America when we arrived in 2008 was that penetration was in the low teens; today it is at 26 to 27%. Several markets in Latin America have penetration rates in excess of 50%, with Argentina at around 70%. Ecuador's low penetration in itself is one of the key factors underpinning future growth potential. We have a market with low penetration, and local cable has limited coverage. When we entered the market, national coverage and satellite service enabled us to offer our service nationwide, which enabled rapid growth. We followed this up with our prepaid service to homes, thereby delivering connection to those households who would not have afforded a postpaid TV service. We focus on content, which makes us a good option. </p><h4>Does DIRECTV have plans to expand into broadband internet?</h4><p>We have done so in other countries, such as Colombia, Argentina, and Venezuela. We are examining options here, but currently there is no available spectrum. It would have to be a wireless solution, because then we could provide better coverage for more remote customers. It makes sense if you are delivering content via streaming to have an alternative option for our customers. </p><h4>Apart from content, what innovations have you implemented this past year?</h4><p>We have focused on delivering content beyond the home, enabling the streaming of our and our providers' content. We have original content focused on delivering sports on our own channels. In 2015, we are also heavily focused on the DIRECTV Play app. We have also had considerable success with the World Cup app where our subscribers could watch games, access statistics, and view replays. Many providers have their own platform, and ours enables us to combine them such that the customer can access all content on just one app. This is a simple way to deliver all content on computer, smart phone, or tablet. Last year we changed the interface of our setup boxes, rendering it simpler, user-friendly, and with all content delivered in HD.</p><h4>What are DIRECTV's prospects for the year ahead?</h4><p>We need to maintain our focus on content, which can only be achieved through agreements with programmers, and again, by providing the customer with different means of watching it. We have to strengthen what we have been doing in the past, especially in streaming and out-of-home experience. We forecast double-digit growth, again despite an ever more difficult market. </p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for the market?</h4><p>The market as been reactivated and competition is tougher, which is entirely characteristic of a market seeing rapid growth. We are one of five satellite operators today, which means that other competitors have the same nationwide coverage. We have faced some economic difficulties, but have adapted, and our service provides a good family entertainment option. We have adapted our offer and opened additional options for our prepaid customers, who are demanding more, such as additional receivers for their homes for a second or third television.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Aeromaster founded and can you summarize its services?</h4><p>I founded Aeromaster in 1989, and our principle activities are aviation maintenance support, aircraft assembly and air transport for passengers and cargo. In our industry, maintenance service provides the greatest revenue. We are currently dealing with an increase in industry taxes and are unable to expand our lines of business or pursue other opportunities in the market. We do, however, have a new business that assembles aircraft locally and have signed three new agreements with international aircraft manufacturers. We signed these agreements a year ago and are planning to begin assembly in September of this year. We are working closely with the Minister of Industries on this project, and we just signed an agreement that will give us space at both Manta and Santa Rosa airports. They are C-level airports, and we are trying to start a second business that will provide air cargo transportation from Manta Airport to the United States and Latin America. We are the only company doing this business in Ecuador, and were prompted to provide this service because of the 45% tax increase on imported aircraft and equipment. We are set to increase our employment and revenues by 100% and will directly hire around 400 people. This will help the country save around $300 million. This concerns the government directly, because right now they are paying around $800 million each year for both the military and civilian sectors combined. </p><h4>How would you say the aeronautics industry will evolve in the short term?</h4><p>We will need to make some amendments to local regulations during the coming years and focus on the industry as a whole, and not solely on aeronautics. We need to produce parts and assemble planes here as well, which would keep our manufacturing costs low. Our main clients will be military and flight schools, and in terms of markets, Cuba, Bolivia and Brazil. Any new clients will come through the Ministry of Industry. We do not actively search for them, but rather they look for us, because they know the market and make plans through state policies. We need to create an engineering department to certify aeronautical parts as the Civil Aviation Authority does not have any local departments that take care of this being solely concentrated on airlines. What we need is to bring in expert engineers to help the authorities; once we have them in place, we are ready to begin work. In the meantime, we will use external certifications in line with the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration), EASA (European Aviation Safety Agency) and LAR (Latin American Regulations). Assuming that we have local certification, we will be able to directly reduce cost by 25%. This market will become more attractive for foreign investment once this certification is localized. We have signed contracts with three international companies, ready to enter the market. This will mark a solid first step toward attracting other player, and there are already two prospective companies interested in joining us. </p><h4>What is your prospect of growth for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Next year we will increase our gross income by 30% and will be starting cargo shipments and assembly lines. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main elements that led to the establishment of the Ministry in February 2015 and what is the vision and mission of the Ministry?</h4><p>The establishment of the Ministry is a response to the geological richness of Ecuador, even though the oil and gas industry in the national economy has minimized the mining sector. In fact, the mining sector was formerly part of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, which included the oil and gas industry. President Correa took the initiative to rebrand the ministry as the Ministry of Non-Renewable Energy, separating electric and renewable energies from it. Amid increasing efforts to diversify the nation's production matrix and economy, President Correa created the Ministry of Mining on February 13, 2015. We should also keep in mind that the mining and oil industries are strikingly different in terms of business strategy and structure. This was another reason prompting the establishment of the ministry. Today, most mining companies operating in the country are rather small, and mining techniques consequently suffer. Our two main priorities are social issues in the mines and the situation of workers, and environment. We are also keen to raise the technology threshold of the industry. In this context, the main challenge Ecuador faces concerns the need to develop key large and medium scale projects.</p><h4>What are the main guidelines of the ministry's strategic plan for sustainable development of the mining industry in Ecuador?</h4><p>We should be mindful that all human activity registers an environmental impact. The mining industry is no stranger to this. Our main challenge is to make sure we comply with all environmental laws in place today. This will give public authorities and society the guarantee of fulfilling requisite environmental requirements. In this context, the Ministry of Environment plays a key role in the independent and transversal supervision of the regulation. The ministry makes sure that all the licensing processes comply with environmental regulation. In this context, we channel the decisions of the Ministry of Environment to make sure its decision is well understood by the company operating each particular project.</p><h4>What are the main ongoing mining projects in Ecuador?</h4><p>At the moment, there are five strategic projects. Mirador, with around 5,000 and 6,000MT of copper; Fruta del Norte with 7 million ounces of gold, with the participation of Lundin Gold, and in which we expect to start building the mine in 2016, and Rí­o Blanco with 600,000 ounces of gold. Chinese company Ecuacorriente is in charge of this project, as well as the Mirador project, and we believe that by late 2015 we could start the construction of the mine. Then there is the Loma Larga project with 1.5 million ounces of gold under the leadership of INV Metals; and finally, the San Carlos-Panantza project, which is at an earlier stage than the rest. There are other interesting projects that Ecuador is developing across the country. One of the main tasks we have focused on over the past few years is in the social arena, as in the past private companies operating mines had given much consideration to communities living in the areas of their business activity. </p><h4>What is your medium-to-long-term outlook for the mining industry?</h4><p>I am optimistic about the future, and we view the development of the mining industry as a long-term project. By our estimates with the five aforementioned strategic projects alone Ecuador's mining industry could receive over $8 billion in FDI by 2025. This would generate some $4 billion in exports and between $800 and $900 million in direct taxes. Our main challenge in the medium term is to resume nationwide exploration works. We believe that 2016 and 2017 could become the two most important years in terms of investment, given that several projects are set to commence operations in 2018. We also need to generate the knowledge and human capital needed to meet the country's mining potential. Additionally, we have taken steps to build bridges with small mining companies in order to better understand their financing needs and potentially assist in their growth in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history behind ITABSA, and of its affiliation with Philip Morris?</h4><p>We started our activities in Ecuador forty years ago, and since then, we have been growing our presence nationwide through diverse products and services. Philip Morris International's presence in Ecuador is not only limited to ITABSA; we are one team, but three companies: TANASA purchases local varieties of tobacco for export to 12 countries and for the manufactures of cigarettes, which is our core business; PROESA, the best and one of the largest distribution companies in Ecuador, distributes those cigarettes and selected products from other leading companies in Ecuador to almost 70,000 points of sale nationwide, and ITABSA which provides general and administrative services for all three companies. </p><h4>Where are you investing the bulk of your resources?</h4><p>We have a long lasting tradition of investing in human capital, as we believe that the key to a successful business is people. Globally, technology is changing fast, but in our business we also face constant and accelerated regulatory and taxation changes. Without top-notch people, we cannot react rapidly so as to remain competitive. Our companies have an excellent pedigree in supporting talent, and Philip Morris International around the world has no less than 14 senior managers and directors who launched their careers in Ecuador. </p><h4>How has tobacco agriculture evolved over the past decade?</h4><p>We buy tobacco in Ecuador not only for internal consumption, but also for export to 12 countries around the world, including selected markets in the EU zone, the US, and other Latin American markets. Like all agricultural businesses, uncertainty abounds because of reliance on climate and international prices; yet we are proud to both export and use high quality Ecuadorian Burley, the main tobacco strain in Ecuador, although there is some Virginia tobacco production, too. Tobacco agriculture is greatly important for us, being our main raw material. Therefore, we not only buy tobacco in Ecuador, but also contribute to tobacco growing communities through the application of Philip Morris International's Good Agricultural Practices standards and in social aspects, such as child labor prevention. </p><h4>How important are Ecuadorian operations in comparison to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Regular smokers in Ecuador are few and far between, averaging six or seven cigarettes a day, whereas in other markets it might be up to 28 a day. Bearing that in mind, the local market is small. However, through the development of our exports and distribution of other business lines, we have become the fourth largest operation in the Latin American region, and Canada. </p><h4>How would you assess the current situation in tobacco smuggling in Ecuador?</h4><p>Ecuador, being a dollarized economy, offers good margins for smugglers, especially in the case of products bearing a high tax burden, like cigarettes. A pack of 20 cigarettes pays at least three dollars in taxes (Excise and VAT), which is a huge incentive for smugglers bringing in contraband. The authorities achieved a key milestone with the approval of the new Criminal Law in 2014, which includes a provision that penalizes petty contraband through fines and the seizure of illegal products. We support government efforts through a campaign to increase retailer awareness of the risk to income and security of selling contraband products. Awareness is key, as smugglers are damaging the economy, since contraband products do not use Ecuadorian tobacco, employ  talented Ecuadorian workers, or pay tax to the IRS.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind the partnership with Spanish company Ulma?</h4><p>Ulma is a cooperative group with 4,000 members and six divisions; one of them is specialized in flanges. About 250 people work in this particular division, with annual sales of $78 billion and with 40,000 tons of production a year, covering 47 countries worldwide. Exports account for 97% of Ulma's production. We have been Ulma's partner in Ecuador since 2008, when we faced a problem with Chinese flanges. We saw the opportunity to increase the quality of our services thanks to this partnership. At that time, Ulma did not have a partner in Ecuador and it was a risky decision for us in terms of production costs. We have been able to position a high standard brand as well as introduce a product that did not previously exist in the Ecuadorian market, a “golden flange" at a highly competitive price. The partnership with Ulma evolved very well after that and they have come to see us as the strongest partner they could have in this market. Over the years, Ulma helped us with very valuable know-how transfer and we have been able to increase volumes year by year, entering key national projects such as Petroamazonas, where these flanges are homologated. We target several key projects in the country, such as the pipeline that runs to the Pacific Refinery. Ulma has put a lot of effort into Ecuador enabling us to work hard on positioning and consolidating their flanges, which are the most valuable and reputable products.</p><h4>Is the company looking into other market niches?</h4><p>We have become a strong brand in the oil and gas industry thanks to our sales and post-sales services. The combination of these two elements is what helps to make the difference in the market. We look at the possibility of expanding into the mining industry, potentially for a large pipeline project in neighboring Peru. This would be our first project beyond our borders, and we are proud to be on the right path. We would like to make the move abroad alongside Ulma and I truly believe it will happen shortly.</p><h4>Where do you see Juan Cevallos in five years?</h4><p>I feel very attracted to business opportunities in Peru. The oil and gas industry in Peru is like the Ecuadorian industry a decade ago. We have a lot of experience to share alongside international partners such as Ulma. This pipeline is an Odebrecht project, with whom we have already partnered in Ecuador.</p><h4>What are some of the key projects you have lined up for the near future?</h4><p>We currently work on a highly interesting project regarding the shift in Ecuador's production matrix; a spiro metallic production plant. This idea originated from an analysis of the imports we do as a company and we will partner with Argentinean Flexim. We already have the physical area where we would locate the plant and I plan to set up Ecuador's first spiro metallic production plant.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015?</h4><p>We closed 2014 on a $7.5 million turnover and after the 1Q2015 I can proudly say that we posted 10% growth on the same period in the previous year. This has been possible thanks to our entering several tenders. For 2015, we plan to relocate our headquarters and warehouse. The current facilities are rather small when we are fully staffed—25 people. We have grown at a rapid pace and have consequently exhausted our existing facility. I intend for construction work to commence in early 2016. And meanwhile, on the social responsibility front, we will open our first football academy in 2H2015.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Almost 26% of the total premiums issued in 2014 came from the vehicle segment. However, in October 2014 you decided to hand your vehicle portfolio to QBE Seguros Colonial. What influenced this decision?</h4><p>We have experienced several normative changes over the past few years, by which our industry was affected. Taxes are not always conducive to our business principles. With insurance, you share huge losses with many people, and in this scenario, taxation is a huge restriction. With several new normative changes, we decided to focus our business on the client. We look at medium and large sized companies and provide total solutions for them. We realized that it was almost impossible to maintain two types of business that are really quite different. The auto segment and the car insurance business are necessarily distributed on a large-scale commercial basis. We were able to do so, but with the legislative changes it became expensive. This kind of business has to be managed by volumes rather than margins, and that is what is used to control the prices, which are increasing everyday with imported cars coming in. We were one of the first companies to make the swap, and we did not make the decision as a cash business, but rather a strategic business. We thought it was the best opportunity to show the benefits of insurance. We still have work to do, and we need to demonstrate the advantages of our coverage. The community can sometimes have a negative view of auto insurance, because it is sometimes regarded as a tax. For us it was not a huge loss to end the auto insurance side of the business because it was restricting our commercial strategy. </p><h4>Which markets are currently the most interesting?</h4><p>The formal and traditional private sector has growth potential because of the current economic situation in the country. There is more room in personal business, and we conducted studies to prove this as well. Much of the Ecuadorian market is not attended to by the insurance sector, especially along the personal lines. From life insurance to car insurance, there are many product lines that are growing, and that have grown in the last ten years. There is a market for residential fire insurance, and this kind of market is where the future lies. There is much demand in the education segment as well as in employment insurance. We are also seeking alliances in life insurance because we do not have that product line right now.</p><h4>What is your long-term outlook for the sector?</h4><p>It is difficult to say what will happen in the industry because the minimum capital requirements have changed. We thought that there would be a fast reaction from the sector, but there was not. We do not know why, because there is not enough business for everyone with these conditions. You have to optimize the market, and there are perhaps too many companies competing for the same business. The market still needs companies specializing in solutions. There needs to be an even focus on different areas, and that is what our strategy is. We want to focus and find out where the markets are, and prepare and develop products for them.</p><h4>What growth prospects do you have for this year?</h4><p>For this year we are anticipating 14% growth, which is large because the industry has gone down by 15%. The automotive business will not grow that fast, and we doubt that car insurance will help with that. We are offering more solutions because sometimes clients need to be pushed towards a certain company when the offerings are all so similar. With a captive market, we can take advantage of that. We launched the new corporate branding, the main reason being to add an inflection point. We are one of the first companies that already have the minimum capital requirements, having made a $3 million investment last November.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the biggest successes of the past year? </h4><p>Issuing $2 billion in debt and bonds was a major success for the country. Ecuador defaulted in 2008, and therefore reclaiming the market proved difficult. It may be also highly beneficial to the private sector by ultimately allowing it to issue in international markets.</p><h4>How would you assess cooperation between the public and private sectors? </h4><p>As additional infrastructure projects and power plants are set to come online in 2016 and 2017, a national surge in utilities will follow. And given that the government faces a liquidity shortage, the public sector understands that it cannot undertake these projects alone. The government is therefore inviting private players to combine forces on key infrastructural projects. This will take some time, however. Ecuador is seeking to attract the private sector into such initiatives and should the business climate improve we may register a measure of progress on this front in late 2015 or 2016.</p><h4>How can Ecuador effectively attract higher levels of FDI?</h4><p>If political noise and the economic risks subside, the pricing environment in Ecuador would improve across many areas of the economy, such as banking and real estate. Less controversy results in more foreign investment. To improve foreign investment we should open up areas of the country, such as the mining sector. Ecuador has significant mining potential but we lack the right incentives. Other Andean countries that have more or less the same mining potential have greater incentives for investment, and Ecuador needs to catch up. Ecuador is attempting to tax mining profits before the mining sector is actually generating any, which is premature. The mining sector is unwilling to make substantial investments because it is concerned that once they are made, Ecuador will change the rules of the game. The government should also encourage investments in certain areas such as electricity and ICT, for example. We also should be working to initiate discussions with Facebook to reach an agreement—as Colombia and Panama have done—in terms of improving the connectivity of Ecuadorians to the internet. We have to eliminate the 5% tax on remittances abroad. Before investing, people think about how that 5% tax is going to effect or change the investment or return they are expecting. The only reason we have a tax on the money sent abroad is to keep the currency locally to stimulate economic activity. But if country risk is mitigated, the 5% remittance tax is eliminated, and the investment climate is improved, foreign investment will increase as will export-related businesses, and there will be plenty of dollars in the country without having a tax to stop money from going overseas. </p><h4>What factors already make Ecuador an attractive destination for investment?</h4><p>The Ecuadorian economy is on the rise. Since 2001 we have had a long period of economic stability. Over the past decade there has been significant growth in the middle class. Ours is a small market—we cannot compete with Colombia and Peru in terms of market scale, but middle class growth provides a good market for small businesses. Multinational companies coming to Latin America tend to seek a broad regional footprint, which provides a good opportunity for Ecuador. There has been some pent up investment that has not entered Ecuador for certain reasons, and now is the time to do so. Mergers and acquisitions that we have seen in Ecuador have been a positive sign that there are opportunities and prices ratios are favorable. Ecuador is not prohibitively expensive, and can serve as an entry point to the entire region. Also, under the assumption that we are set to maintain the dollarization regime, this would be a good environment for companies to keep investing in. If you consider the largest insurance companies in Ecuador, four out of five are multinationals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights for CFN in 2014?</h4><p>Last year was a success for CFN. We worked at facilitating public policy with financial instruments that have proven useful for our clients, namely the private sector of Ecuador, and the productive sector, which received $700 million. As for financial figures, we had a good return on equity and assets, and are sustainable in terms of delivering returns. Though we are a development bank and non profit-oriented, we do need to turn a profit to reinvest our resources in special programs and not depend on government funding. The return on assets was 1.37%, which is an efficient print. We strongly believe that efficiency is a must for a development institution such as ours. We have to be more efficient than private banks, always bearing in mind that our role is, to complement them, rather than displace them. As part of having a lean institution, we began by focusing on shortening credit approval time; we cut it down from an average of 260 days to 100 days. Total assets have risen notably; our loan book has gone up, as well as equity. The increase in liabilities is a positive indicator.</p><h4>What is the aim of the Progresar program, and what is its effect on the shift in the production matrix?</h4><p>In 2014 we worked extensively with the productive sector through the Progresar program. According to the latest figures as of April of 2015, projects included in this facility totaled investments of $122 million, of which fixed assets were $90 million. Investment in fixed assets (capex-capital expenditures) gives you a true grasp of the commitment of entrepreneurs with a long-term vision that is beneficial for our nation. That is why Progresar is particularly useful and has the potential to succeed. The Development Bank of Latin America (CAF) has been of great help to CFN, which is why we can extend long-term loans with grace periods to clients on a project-by-project basis. Repayment of loans run up to 15 years with up to two-year grace period at a 6.9% fixed interest rate. This is unique, particularly in South America. Our government is firmly committed to fostering the productive sector. The objectives of the Progresar program are to increase exports, if possible with value added, substitute imports, and improve productivity. I can cite two examples of the tuna industry and tourism sector. </p><h4>How is CFN supporting the real estate and construction sectors?</h4><p>We are heavily focused on public housing, but only within the $40,000 to $70,000 price bracket, where we cater to the middle class and young professionals. This is part of a harmonized action led by the Coordinator Ministry of Political Economy to put together financing offers and demand for housing, working with the appropriate private financial institutions and public financial entities on this. The private sector extends housing loans to individuals at 4.99% for up to 15-20 years, and we fund the offer of houses to constructors. Since we have been traditionally working with the productive sector, materials used may come from our clients, leading to a win-win situation for all involved. Over the coming year we will be launching several new products. Factoring is a tool that can be applied usefully to many businesses and is particularly convenient for SMEs. There are other sectors of interest, but I should mention an important one for development in Ecuador, which is forestry. Numerous investors recently gathered in Guayaquil and praised the potent incentives and legal framework that has been developed for commercial forestry. Finally, we are working to finance innovation in entrepreneurship. In general there is a valuable presence of development banks, some believe that public financial institutions should analyze and approve projects as part of their daily business, which I dispute. The focus should essentially be on investing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lundin Gold recently purchased the Fruta del Norte project from Kinross for $240 million in cash and stock. Why did Kinross pull out of the project and why is Lundin Gold ready to take on the challenge?</h4><p>Kinross made the decision in 2013 to discontinue the development of the project after two years of negotiations with the government of Ecuador and following the failure to reach agreement on fiscal and developmental terms. Over the next 18 months it tried to reach a resolution. In May of 2014, we began to evaluate the opportunity and moved quickly to close the transaction in December 2014. I have been involved with the Lundin Family for 20 years, and it is a great opportunity for me. The Lundin family has invested $100 million of its personal money into the project and will continue to invest as needed. In 2014 the Ecuadorian government began to become more focused on developing mining as a facet of its economy. The fall in oil prices has created even more of a focus on mining and how this economy needs to diversify.</p><h4>Ecuador has not always been open to mining investment. How confident do you feel about the improvement in the Ecuadorian mining fiscal and regulatory environment?</h4><p>We feel rather confident, but as I have told our investors, this is not a smooth journey. There will be times when we advise investors to fasten their seat belts. However, our approach is slightly different, as most of our management team is in-country and we are committed to Ecuador, working with its government and the people of Ecuador to realize the project at hand. We have Latin American advisors, primarily from Chile, who are convinced that this is the optimum time for the project.</p><h4>Fruta del Norte is unquestionably one of the world's best as-yet undeveloped gold deposits. What are your expectations from this project and what profit do you foresee?</h4><p>Profit is contingent upon the gold price. Many people ask me what my expectations are for the gold price, and my answer in short is that it does not concern me. This is one of the best undeveloped gold reserves in the world and also ranks among the highest-grade sites. We will be profitable at gold prices that might put many other companies out of business, and the government will still be generating returns. We have 18 months since the date that we signed to submit what is called a phase change application to go to exploitation. Therefore, we have multiple engineering efforts currently underway, and other than certain unique specialty areas being done in Canada, all other efforts are being expended in Latin America. Our goal, once we have the feasibility study done and phase changes, is to move straight into construction, and hopefully by 1Q2019 we expect to pour the first gold bar.</p><h4>Does Lundin Gold intend to develop any other projects in the country?</h4><p>We find ourselves in a solid position in that we can hopefully set the standards for responsible mining in Ecuador. We see this not only as an opportunity for Lundin Gold, but also for some of our sister companies such as NGEx Resources Inc., a company with exploration projects in Argentina and Chile.</p><h4>What is the objective of Lundin Gold for 2015?</h4><p>We expect 2016 to be more of a key year for us than 2015, because by June 2016 we are obliged to have submitted our exploitation phase transition documentation, whereby 2015 will require tremendous efforts. We have technological activities on site and will involve significant engineering; working with the government on moving forward with agreements, and starting to work with various financial institutions to ensure that related financing is in place when the time comes to construct the facility. 2015 will be a year of major progress, rather than milestones.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Pro Ecuador's plan for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our strategic plan in 2015 has two main lines of attention: attracting investment and exporting services. The first area focuses on attracting investment into the main productive sector, including the forestry sector. We have already developed several activities to attract investment such as business symposiums and roundtables. There are other sectors besides forestry on which we focus our efforts such as metalworking, and ICT. Our efforts go into building bridges between foreign and local companies, for which our 30 branch offices in 25 different countries are essential. In order to foster a friendly business environment in the country, our work, following the governmental policy, is centered on promoting the benefits of Ecuador in terms of facilities and infrastructure, as well as showcasing its international recognitions as an investment recipient. The government has invested significantly in infrastructure, optical fiber, and related services, which have lifted Ecuador into an upper level.</p><h4>Which were the greatest investments in Ecuador in 2014?</h4><p>Last year, around of $31 million of greenfield investment was brought into the country. An investment of $283 million is expected this year. These investments have all been a direct result of Pro Ecuador's work in sectors such as agribusiness, auto parts and plastics, among others</p><h4>What needs to be done to further promote exporting among Ecuadorian companies and change the investment culture?</h4><p>We need to change the mindset of many companies and make them realize what is needed in order to grow. There are plenty of opportunities abroad for Ecuadorian companies, which might not be fully developed currently, but if they received the correct support, they could change the history of the Ecuadorian commerce. Boosting Ecuadorian exports of products and services with technology and added value will also help to diversify the economy, generating further employment. In this regard, our main results of successful business opportunities have been seen through B2B events. <br>Over the last year, we have also channeled great attention into services exports. We have high hopes for the education sector, for example. Education is one of the sectors set to drive the change in the production matrix. To this end, the government has taken important steps such as creating the City of Knowledge to encourage the role of education and science in the national economy. Another winner is health and medical service; Ecuadorian doctors have an excellent reputation and international patients are aware of the relatively low costs of medical services in Ecuador. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the Ecuadorian economy in three to five years?</h4><p>Our main challenges concern investment, without which, we will struggle to establish a knowledge-based economy. Competitiveness is another challenge facing the country. Finally, we face the challenge of ensuring sufficient qualified human resources; the government has already taken key steps in this context with scholarship programs and attracting pre-retirement academic experts to teach at Ecuadorian universities. However, we cannot rest on our laurels. In terms of the development of lined up investments, I am optimistic, while the roundtables we have organized have yielded positive results, as has public sector investment in areas such as infrastructure. This allows me to believe that we are about to harvest what was previously sown.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In December 2014, the organization opened its new office in Ecuador. What is the importance of Ecuador hosting the headquarters of UNASUR?</h4><p>This office will play a key role in regional integration and is located at an emblematic address—the equator of the world. Ours is a very young organization that brings together all political players of the region. Among the most important projects we handle is the convergence of all regional projects taking place, including Mercosur, the Pacific Alliance, and ALBA countries, among others</p><h4>What are the main differences between the construction processes of the EU and UNASUR?<br></h4><p>We start off from a different point of view; as a region, we have a common language and history, as well as a similar geography and conditions. We are the fourth largest economy in the world and we started building this on the common regional identity the countries in the region display. We have common regional projects within the infrastructure, connectivity, and institutionalization fields, among others. </p><h4>The Banco del Sur aims to become the main financial institution in the region. At what stage of development is the bank today?</h4><p>One of our main objectives is to financially strengthen the region through several tools such as the Andean Development Corporation, the Latin-American Reserve Fund, the Mercosur Infrastructure Fund, and the Southern Bank. This project has developed at a slow pace, but has already established its directory. I believe it will play a key role in leveraging the resources of the region. </p><h4>In April 2015 UNASUR created the South American Defense School. How would you assess the new defense policies that UNASUR is keen to implement in the region through this school? </h4><p>In April 2015 we established the South-American Defense School, which aims to achieve a higher level of regional security. We work towards common security and defense policies regarding several risks as climate change. We work to promote sustainability, and biodiversity as these are areas we must promote to ensure security. The curriculum is also concerned with civil security. </p><h4>Ecuador has shown interest in developing a dispute-resolving body through UNASUR. How would you evaluate the development of this body?</h4><p>The initiative has already achieved virtually 100% consensus. I would say that current dispute resolution mechanisms are obsolete and uniformly result in litigation. We have a completely different approach that instead prioritizes consensus. </p><h4>After Ecuador recognized plans to reduce medicine prices by 30%, to what extent could the nation serve as an example for the region in promoting healthcare access?</h4><p>We have three ongoing projects where it concerns access to healthcare and medication, for we understand of the need the region and its people have. Today 30% of health expenditure among people in the region derives from medicaments. We, for example, conduct market research to show people how much they would be charged for the same prescription in selected countries; in some cases, this can be up to 10 times more. In this context, our main objectives in this field are transparency, a map where generic drugs can be produced. We also applaud Ecuador's proactive attitude when it comes to food labeling and are keen for other countries to adopt the same measures. The main policies in the regional healthcare sphere today target childhood obesity, cancer, medicaments, and CNCDs.</p><h4>How would you assess Ecuador's contribution to UNASUR?</h4><p>All countries highly contribute to UNASUR and all the organization's arms. Ecuador is no exception to this. For example, Ecuador is poised to pass legislation regarding its citizens' right to mobility in the region, and vice versa. Ecuador also positively contributes to UNASUR in fields such as infrastructure, new technologies, and education, for example. And meanwhile, the City of Knowledge Ecuador is a hugely interesting project that could yet serve as a template for other countries in the region. It is a prime example of the innovative drive of the nation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

	During the Summit of the Americas, the PM emphasized the importance of regional integration. What is being done in this regard?
</h4><p>
	Our primary area of focus and concern is within the context of CARICOM. Barbados is a small state with an area of 166 square miles with a population of about 300,000 people. That constitutes a small society and a small economy, but, of course, as part of the English-speaking Commonwealth, we share a common historical and social heritage with other Caribbean states, and recognize the value of collaboration and integration. This is a process that has been formalized over several years. We have signed many agreements and we are pursuing a single market and economy. For us, integration is a process that has evolved after independence in post-colonial times. It allows us to integrate our markets and engage the world jointly. There are not only economic and commercial benefits to integration, but it also allows us to become a regional family—literally and figuratively. Many Caribbean people have familial ties across the region, so within this context, integration allows us to realize a number of synergies, economic or otherwise.
</p><h4>
	What should be done to strengthen bilateral ties between South America and the Caribbean?
</h4><p>
	We are all part of a number of hemispherical organizations including the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, CELAC and the Organization of American States. Within the context of CELAC, we have member states that have strong ties with other member states. For example, Cuba for us has been an important ally and a neighbor in many respects for many years. Barbados is one of four small countries in the region that defied the position taken by the US and recognized Cuban diplomatic relations. We have mostly engaged with Cuba in training and education. We have engaged Cuba in multiple ways since 1972.  Two major areas of cooperation are training and education.
</p><h4>
	In a call by Ecuador's Minister of Foreign Affairs Ricardo Patiño, both Ministries focused on human rights. How are both nations cooperating in this area?
</h4><p>
	Ecuador, like many other countries in Latin America, is a member of regional hemispheric bodies. As a small country, we have been unable to convert that multilateral engagement into strong bilateral relations. Barbados considers human rights a key pillar upon which society rests. We have been involved in regional bodies, of course, but as we participate more fully in CELAC and other bodies, we anticipate the ability to build stronger bilateral relationships. Our engagement in regional bodies must play out at the level of bilateral engagement, nation to nation. Language differences have been an issue that have limited the strengthening of relations between countries, in South and Central America and the Caribbean. The addressing of language constraints is an issue we have been working to solve, and is something we can explore with Ecuador, be it through us learning Spanish, or them learning English. People-to-people exchanges help with this.
</p><h4>What is your short term outlook for the economy of Barbados?</h4><p>
	In the short term, despite the positive performance of key sectors, we continue to grapple with the need to address inefficiencies. The international business sector contributes the single highest percentage of our corporate taxes. We have been looking to diversify our economy away from tourism and international business. One area of focus is agriculture.  Here we are looking beyond traditional approaches, and at the utilization of modern technology to render it commercially viable and attractive to our youth. We also have a renewed focus on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  We are pleased that we have been able to tap the talents of the Barbadian and Caribbean diaspora.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>YachayTech opened its doors in March of 2014. How has the university developed over the year?</h4><p>We have consolidated the university, and currently have 640 students living in YachayTech dorm rooms. All of the lecturers and professors hail from top universities, and all hold a PhD or equivalent according to the Bologna Act. We have opened the Institute of Technology for new professionals in dual programs in collaboration with the German government, the University of Berlin, and the Technical University of Berlin. We hope to have consolidated our infrastructure for the first stage of the project, which is the 280 ha Science and Technology Park, and by September we will have opened two centers of technology to accommodate more than 10 companies in the ICT field. We have acquired a data center set to be the most advanced in Latin America in the field of processing. We also have consolidated a residential area for administrative and academic staff, and for people coming to live in Yachay City of Knowledge, such as employees from industry. We are now the first center of science and technology in Ecuador, with publications in indexed magazines and books specialized in science and technology, including 50 publications between March 2014 and July 2015. We have realized numerous collaborations with research centers in the public sector, other universities, and the commercial area of the enterprises that are associated with Yachay City of Knowledge. We have organized more than 20 seminars and academic events during the year, with more than 400 scientists associated with Yachay City of Knowledge. There are over 650 entrepreneurs associated with Yachay City of Knowledge, collaborating with our Innopolis incubator.</p><h4>What accounts for the growing entrepreneurial community in Ecuador?</h4><p>Considering that social and economic behavior is such a large part of the economy, you almost have a tangible sense of the entrepreneurial spirit in all economic activity. This stretches far beyond the quest for accommodation, to sharing resources toward broader economic progress. The way to increase quality of life is to facilitate the utilization of better technology to improve the productive process and implement best practices. It's a matter of transferring adequate technology to give those working in industry a high value chain in the production process. Right now the challenge for Yachay City of Knowledge and the science and technology system is to boost productive processes. For example, agriculture and ICT are merging to transform activities for precision agriculture. Small business owners are doing better business just by opening new sales channels such as e-commerce and selling online.</p><h4>The total investment in Yachay City of Knowledge from 2013 to 2017 will exceed $1 million. What other investments will materialize this year?</h4><p>We are optimistic about the construction of six plants in the pharmaceutical industry, in cooperation between the public and private sectors. More than $260 million will be invested in basic services in Yachay City of Knowledge to improve their services and complete the urbanization of the park. We are bringing online three optic fiber backup networks in each site in Yachay City of Knowledge. In terms of private investments, in Yachay City of Knowledge we have 27 companies working with us, such as Telefónica, Cisco, and Indra, for a total of more than $20 million, and also with the Chamber of Industries and Production, and the textiles industry where we are developing a project valued at $5 million for innovation labs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of the trade agreement with the EU for Ecuador's economy?</h4><p>Negotiating the agreement became a smooth affair once a common consensus had been reached; yet there are always processes that require implementation to fully appraise its final form. The EU in 2015 extended the commercial preferences for Ecuador to access to the EU market. This is highly important and we believe that the advantages of such an agreement benefit both Ecuadorian and EU companies. Europe is substantial market and we see the agreement as the stability and long-term vision that Ecuador's productive sector requires in order to grow and develop closer ties with the EU. </p><h4>How does this agreement fit into the objectives of the Ministry to generate an inclusive development model?</h4><p>Europe is a highly important market for fair trade and organic products, a niche in which Ecuador already plays an important role, but has much more yet to offer. At the same time, I believe that Europe can provide an answer to the intangible value of our products.</p><h4>What has been the impact of the government's decision to implement a safeguard tariff on imports of 2,800 products for a period of 15 months to protect the balance of payments?</h4><p>This measure has the objective of influencing the kinds of products Ecuador imports. This technical action was developed in accordance to the framework provided by the World Trade Organization (WTO), whom we expect to fully validate it shortly. This is a temporal decision aimed at taking action in a context in which Ecuador has the inability to make a correction of the value of its national currency. We, in this case, need to take similar action to that of devaluing ones own currency. I think this measure has a rather low impact on the productive apparatus of the country and the main raw materials we import.</p><h4>What actions does the Ministry take to boost exports?</h4><p>Non-traditional exports have increased over the past seven years at an average annual rate of 14%. This has resulted from several incentives and efforts from the public authorities that include wider financial tools, tax incentives, and export support, among others. Our efforts have run in parallel to those of Pro Ecuador and its extensive network of offices across the world.</p><h4>Commerce, at $48 million, was the economic sector in which investment flow expanded the most in 2014. How does the Ministry work to further increase investment flow in Ecuador?</h4><p>Traditionally, Ecuador has not been a destination for FDI. However, we have increased the benefits available and attractiveness of the country through tax and other incentives. We have also worked to increase the competitiveness of Ecuador's economy by such measures as eliminating bureaucratic barriers in order to establish companies and setting preferential credit lines. All of these actions fit within the country's legal framework. </p><h4>What are the main objectives the Ministry has lined up in terms of trade and other such agreements for 2015?</h4><p>1H2015 threw highly interesting figures into the mix; we are one of the very few regional countries in which non-oil exports have not decreased. This is vital when taking into account the complex international situation. In 2015, we will strengthen efforts and actions to diversify products, services and markets. We will also ramp up our efforts to better articulate commercial and public policies. And meanwhile, we expect to maintain the level of exports observed in 2014, which would be a significant achievement. Overall, I think that the economic situation of Ecuador will improve; currency savings will increase as we decrease oil derivative imports, for example, to generate electrical energy. I think exports of non-oil products will considerably increase in the near future thanks to commercial agreements as well as the revocation of other types of barriers at the local level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Trinidad and Tobago's role in global democracy and what steps are being taken to move forward in the international scene?</h4><p>Trinidad and Tobago is at a pivotal point, both globally and hemispherically. Our visitors like the Vice President of the US, the President of the People's Republic of China, and Japan's Prime Minister are evidence of this. In terms of global diplomacy, we have always operated according to certain fundamental principles, and been anchored in human rights, peace, security, and democracy. We have attempted to mediate in global affairs wherever we are present and, in that sense, have earned the respect of the global community as a country that takes its position on the basis of fundamental principles that are rooted in international relations. We are also proactive in global issues such as the Arms Trade Treaty. </p><h4>How do you assess the air traffic links between Trinidad and Tobago and Latin America?</h4><p>I traveled to the Dominican Republic and met with the Foreign Minister to discuss connectivity and how we can partner with Avianca and Caribbean Airlines. Those talks have to be followed up with technical discussions for prospects and possibilities. There was a definite interest expressed by Avianca to consider this option for more direct flights to Trinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the aviation agreement we are working on is being finalized. Air transport follows trade and the movement of people. It is expected that as trade and travel increase, so too, will air transport financing is expected improve. The Latin American countries have brought this issue to the agenda, and now the commercial and logistics are being worked on. I anticipate that over the next decade this will become a possibility. </p><h4>Trinidad and Tobago and Ecuador have long enjoyed positive diplomatic relations. What issues have been strengthened over the past few years between both nations?</h4><p>We are very mindful of Ecuador's leading role in UNASUR and the way they have been able to provide leadership in UNASUR. We are not a member, but are constantly apprised of that role. Our relationship to UNASUR and Ecuador is really co-terminus. They are involved in other bodies, but we see them as critical in this respect. They are also an oil-producing country and a commercial relationship exists as well as technical exchanges. This is a natural area of cooperation. </p><h4>Trinidad and Tobago is a major exporter of gas and hydrocarbons and has great experience in refining. How is Trinidad and Tobago cooperating with Ecuador in the energy sector?</h4><p>The global economy is rapidly changing and there are oil cycles with respect to prices. The idea of jointly pursuing exploration opportunities is something that could be placed on the agenda as we both have expertise in this regard, and in that sense, our firms are also interested in partnering Latin America in this area. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the Trinidad and Tobago economy for 2015 and beyond?</h4><p>Three areas of diversification have been successful in Trinidad, one of which concerns energy itself. We have been able to shift from a monoculture petroleum production economy to one that produces gas, petroleum, petrochemicals, and a number of byproducts. We have also been able to extend the scope of our financial sector, which is now highly diversified and robust, operating in the entire region. The services sector is the third area undergoing diversification. While nascent, it is where we intend to focus in terms of diversification, which includes tourism, financial, and IT services—success there has still to be seen.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As we had anticipated 2013, 2014, and 2015 have proven to be difficult in terms of the substantial investments required, and had they been undertaken decades earlier, Ecuador would have been a radically different country today.</p><p><span></span>Before the current external problems being faced, we had estimated a GDP deficit of 5% because of historical and urgent investments in hydropower, multipurpose water management projects, and the upgrading of the refinery in Esmeraldas, which also required a halt to its operations and increased fuel imports.</p><p><span></span>We had not expected a decline in oil prices to match that observed from September 2014, or else the steady appreciation of the dollar, coupled with the deliberate devaluation of local currencies in neighboring countries.</p><p><span></span>The problem has been external rather than fiscal, and the key instrument in tackling such situations is the exchange rate, which we lack in the absence of our own national currency. We needed to take urgent alternative measures, which we duly did. Respecting all international agreements Ecuador is party to, we applied security measures such as 30% tariff surcharges on imports, equivalent to less than 8% of goods available in the economy, which are also not mass consumption goods that impact the food basket.</p><p><span></span>The results have exceeded expectations. Today we consume higher quality products made in Ecuador, benefiting thousands of fellow producers, large and small, and at lower prices.</p><p><span></span>Last year, despite facing several months of falling oil prices and dollar appreciation, we grew by 3.8%. The non-oil segment of GDP, which basically responds to public policy, grew 4.3%—almost fourfold the Latin American average of 1.1%.</p><p><span></span>Today tax revenues contribute more than 50% of the country's general budget. Between January and April 2015, we raised $5.3 billion, exceeding the amount generated in the same period of last year by more than $440 million, on an increase of 9%.</p><p><span></span>Between January and April, VAT on internal operations, which is one of the best indicators of economic dynamism, showed cumulative growth of 15% over the same period last year. Like VAT, withholding tax on income also reflects the level of transactions performed by economic agents. During January-April 2015, this reached $980 million, an accumulated growth of 10% over the same period last year, confirming the dynamism in the economy during this period.</p><p><span></span>The balances of deposits in the private financial system to April 2015 rose 5.13% compared to April last year, on an increase of $1.3 billion; this reflects depositor confidence in the system. The balance of loans of the private financial system grew by 12.9% between April 2014 and April 2015 to reach $2.2 billion.</p><p><span></span>Private banking assets rose 6.3% between April 2014 and April 2015 to $3.1 billion, at the same time increasing its 1Q2015 profits from $96.6 million in 2014 to $107.3 million in 2015, on an increase of 11%. To date, the Deposit Insurance Fund and the Liquidity Fund, created by our government in support of the financial system, have a cumulative value of $3.6 billion. Today, International Reserves amount to $4.8 billion, at almost 5% of GDP.</p><p><span></span>Annual inflation between April 2014 and April 2015 was at 4.3%, and accumulated inflation between January 2015 and April 2015 at 2.5%. The variation in prices this year is due to factors including a harsh winter season that caused certain product shortages, the closure of key roads and highways to domestic trading, and increased transportation costs, which, frozen for years, were recently reviewed by the municipalities. The security measures adopted by the government have, however, not notably impacted inflation.</p><p><span></span>From September 2014 until April 2015 the country stopped receiving $2.2 billion in oil revenues, although no strategic work or project was discontinued, no child left school, and no pensioner failed to receive their pension. I am convinced that the hardest period is now over. In March, with the so-called punishment for quality differential, our oil hit $34.7/bbl, which in many cases is not sufficient to cover production costs. Today the price of oil has recovered to $58/bbl, and we will advance without further difficulty.</p><p><span></span>We always said that our adjustment variable, in the event of difficulties, would be public investment, rather than liquidity funds, which besides undermining the fundamental principle of macroeconomics of converting the most efficient saving into investment, only served to guarantee the payment of external debt. In fact, these funds were abroad, earning interest rates of less than half a percentage point, while the country was still paying bonds with interest rates of 12%.</p><p><span></span>We have shown that with or without oil, our economy is strong. The fiscal situation is also quite solid. In eight years, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have risen from 10% to 13.5%, equivalent to an increase in revenues of $8.9 billion. In this context, $9.14 of every $10 of this increase corresponds to the management of the Internal Revenue Service and just $0.86 to tax reforms.</p><p><span></span>Our current expenditure is at 15% of GDP, three percentage points below the regional average. Since 2007, permanent state revenue has funded all ongoing expenses. In private accounting, this amounts to operational profitability. Ecuador has the highest public investment in the region for the common good of its citizens. While the regional average for public investment is 4% of GDP, Ecuador almost triples this. Ecuador is one of the six less indebted countries in the region with a public debt/GDP ratio of 29.9% in 2014, compared with an average of 39% for Latin America.</p><p><span></span>I know very well that there are structural, external, fiscal, systemic competitiveness and technological bottlenecks that if not remedied, they will never allow us to take off toward development, and that can only be overcome by appropriate investment. This will be achieved by planning, appropriate public investment, effective regulation, and appropriate policies. </p><p><span></span>We have recovered the state to guarantee rights. The middle class has grown and the increasing access to education builds an empowered citizenry that has the obligation to engage with the state to build the common good. We have always been clear that our revolution is citizen-based, as the citizens hold the power. </p><p><span></span>The reduction of poverty and inequality is historic, resounding, and irrefutable. All studies show that since we have been in office, poverty is less severe than before; economic and social gaps have been shortened; and we have experienced upward social mobility.</p><p><span></span>The National Secretariat of Planning and the Statistics and Census Institute has released the results of the Living Conditions Survey 2013-2014. This survey, conducted on average every ten years, shows a significant drop in consumption poverty from 38.3% in 2006 to 25.8% in 2014—down 12.5pp, of which 7.1pp is due to redistribution and 5.4pp to economic growth policies.</p><p><span></span>The Living Conditions Survey also shows that between 2006 and 2014 all households in the country improved their level of consumption by an average of 23.6%, while consumption of the poorest 10% of the population increased by 54.9%, while consumption of the richest 10% grew by 15.9%. Everybody improved their levels of consumption; however, the increase was significantly greater in those who need it the most, allowing lower Gini coefficient for consumption, the main measure of inequality, from 0.45 in 2006 to 0.40 in 2014.</p><p><span></span>Our growth has been pro-poor; that is, the welfare of the poorest has grown faster than that of the wealthiest, leading to the foundation of a more equal and cohesive society. We note that the reduction of inequality and poverty in turn is a brand of the Citizen's Revolution.</p><p><span></span>However, there is something more important and denotes a further structural change. In our government, poverty and inequality reduction has been based on access to rights. The increase in tuition, transit, and exit at every stage of education has been faster in the poorer strata than in the rest of the population. The same applies to the increased access to social security and health.</p><p><span></span>This democratizing access to human capabilities breaks the intergenerational transmission of poverty and inequality that our society has suffered. The Citizen's Revolution is a transformation of the mind that, from a historical perspective, has considered future generations and held responsibility for them.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the Ministry's strategy to promote and enhance social cohesion among Panamanian people?</h4><p>The current government presented its vision and ideas during the electoral campaign, though many thought that this was only propaganda. We prioritize social equity and development through high-quality education and enacting education reforms that have an impact on both students and professors; through integral and high-quality healthcare reaching even indigenous communities and all areas of the country; and finally through providing a higher quality of life to our people through environmental protection and sustainability efforts. When we took over, our first priority was to catch up as the Ministry and finish whatever remains to be done. We recognized the problems; inequality, poor distribution of wealth, and discrimination. Having said that, the Ministry's focus is on rural regions and on the autochthonous population. Other groups we have identified as high risk are youth, working children, and women. We are focusing on them, and we will develop strategies that will tackle the issues.</p><h4>Due to its position as point of crossing and center of transport Panama is a melting pot of cultures and races. Today do you still consider immigration an opportunity or a challenge for the country?</h4><p>Immigration, if done in a planned manner and with good controls, is a positive opportunity for Panama. We are a rather small country with a population of about 4 million people. Panama itself offers many opportunities and, unfortunately, we do not have enough people to make all of them a reality. However, the country has a lack of effective policies in this regard to make immigration an effective tool for development. The subject has been rather politicized over the years; some argue that it has become excessive, and now we are suffering the consequences. Immigration has already brought the country much in terms of qualified human resources, technological advances, and so on. However, it has also brought some new challenges. In light of this, we need to take action in order to give a legal and regulatory framework to immigration policies.</p><h4>How does the Ministry work to create synergy with other national and international institutions?</h4><p>Since we have started at the Ministry, we have developed a social cabinet in which all ministries and main public organizations in the region take part to develop the social policies of the country. The policies are then ratified by the executive committee and finally the parliament. We have achieved a lot since the establishment of the cabinet, addressing social issues the country dragged their feet on for over a decade, such as the equalization of marriage age (18) and the creation of the interagency commission for the development of the Children's Code. We have also developed cooperation agreements with many social entities, such as national universities graduating qualified professionals that can join the workforce in a number of sectors. We have addressed illiteracy—Panama's literacy rate is at just over 94.1%, and we are developing literacy programs and establishing partnerships with the private sector in order to offer more job opportunities. Finally, we have signed social partnerships and agreements with the civil society and many international organizations, such as the EU.</p><h4>What are the main objectives of the Ministry for 2015?</h4><p>Our main goals for 2015 are centered around institutional reorganization, which has already been achieved in large part, the improvement of the impact of our social policies, and the development of an integral social protection plan for the entire country. We  willcontinue improvising social policies regarding social protection, especially when it comes to groups at high risk of exclusion. We will also make sure we develop first class care centers for newborns and children. In this context, our strategy is to upgrade the current centers and develop new ones. Finally, we will be taking steps towards the implementation of emergency and contingency plans in cases of natural disasters. For this purpose, we must organize society. We will also boost volunteering across the country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind Petra Group?</h4><p>We look at things that make a difference. I'm a social capitalist. What we're about is making money, but in the process of that seeing if we can make a difference to society, and if we can improve things. I always look for businesses and ideas that can achieve such progress, whether it's in biotech, in industrial tech, or whether it's in our movie business. For me it's just finding new innovations. We're all about strategic partnerships and we're very keen to work with other people. So it's not just about selling something, it's also about contributing to creating a more affluent society. I need to play a role in education, to help people move up, to make an impact on society. If everyone did something, imagine how things would change. Once you do that, you've earned all the bells and whistles. You've earned your money.</p><h4>Could you fill us in on the nature of your movie business?</h4><p>The fastest growing area in Asia is entertainment and the delivery of entertainment. The challenge is how to entertain the new generation of Asians who are growing by double-digit percentages annually, and whose demand for instant gratification is higher, and how to also educate them through entertainment. We undertake the production of movies and are also aggressively looking into technologies that are related to the media. We have also been working on a number of TV series.</p><h4>The group, through its subsidiary Green Rubber Global, is engaged in recycling rubber. What social problem does this address?</h4><p>The world's number one environmental problem right now, believe it or not, is waste tires: we throw out 1.4 billion tires a year, which go into landfills, tire mountains, or are burnt for energy. Burning tires for energy is disastrous, releasing sulfur and toxins into the air. Yet if you bury tires, you contaminate the soil and the water table. As for tire mountains, they breed mosquitoes and hence diseases like malaria or dengue fever. And if these piles catch fire, you cannot extinguish them. It's not talked about because it's not a product you can claim to want less of. The more development and wealth, the more cars, and the more cars, the more tires. So what we've come up with is a way to recycle it back into a compound that can then go back into tires, or shoes, or any rubber product. It's the world's only truly commercialized process for recycling rubber for tires. So it's true recycling, and the recycled compound is cheaper than the original. It's one of those few products where nobody loses. I win, the manufacturer wins thanks to the lower cost, and the end user wins, too. We're opening a plant in the UK now, which PM David Cameron has recently announced, and also here in Malaysia and in the Middle East. We will export this recycled rubber all over the world. We want to expand into America, South America, Southern Africa, and indeed, comprehensively. Our aim is to make it the focus of a poverty eradication program that allows communities to recycle their waste. So the idea is to visit communities and teach them how to turn what is waste into green rubber. This will galvanize communities into considering the environment, while at the same time empowering them as they will be generating income in the process. In short, it's a good balance.</p><h4>To what causes is the Sekhar Foundation committed?</h4><p>About 60% of Petra Group is owned by my foundation. The foundation builds schools and orphanages around the world. We have orphanages in Colombia, we built a school in Armenia, and have facilities in India. We want to build and contribute wherever there is a need to be met. We are involved in programs for autism, also helping terminally ill children—all programs that have a tough time gaining public awareness. We believe that businesses must be involved in advancing society, and that society must be defined as the people living in it, as communities. This is not about getting a CSR box ticked off. It's got to be a part of what you do on a much more integrated level. That's why we set up our Sekhar Institute for Social Capitalism &amp; Leadership, where we are set to research and provide coverage of social capitalism, leadership, and how companies and governments can play a role. It's beyond a think-tank, and is an actual research institute. We are set to stage our first social capitalism conference soon; a platform from which we will endeavor to change the public mindset for the better. We are keen to start the debate to make a lasting difference.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>It appears that the situation will not be a pleasant one. That being said, down cycles are where opportunities lie. No matter what people know about Malaysia, they know of its success as a trading nation, and ultimately the backbone of this trading nation is the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) and industries operating within it. Local SMEs and SMIs are thriving, and inspire much faith for the future. As a nation we have been blessed with a well-educated and English-speaking workforce, natural beauty, rubber, palm oil, petroleum, timber, paddy (rice), and little to no major natural disasters. We'll get through these issues, but what foreign investors must see now is opportunity, and Malaysia will be this land of opportunity for the next year. We have to go through this down cycle. We have to accept that the US will introduce higher interest rates, that this will impact the dollar, and us. It will happen. But the fundamentals are strong, and the small and medium size industries are what drive this country, regardless of the politics. We'll continue to thrive and trade no matter what. Politics and other sources of noise aside, the nation is nothing if not an example of opportunity, strength, and promise.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	What impact does Le Gray's strategic location in downtown Beirut have on the guests' experience?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>When people say that location is of utmost importance, in most cases this really is absolutely true. Situated where were are, on Martyrs' Square at the main entrance of downtown Beirut, which used to be one of the historical gates—Bab El Serail—we are ideally located for access to the business district, shopping, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs, which makes it ideal for both business and leisure. The very fact that guests can just walk out and are within minutes of what they want to see and do without having to take a taxi is a huge advantage. It is, of course, equally important for the local clientele to be able to access us so easily.
</p><h4>What is the concept and philosophy behind Le Gray's design and how did it evolve?</h4><p>
	<span></span>The concept was very much about creating an original hotel that was designed for Beirut. As a high-energy and sexy city, we really wanted Le Gray to be part of this and become a hotel that truly belonged in such an environment with its pool, restaurants, and terraces; a real meeting spot and hub in Beirut. I never want our hotels to be trendy or super fashionable, but rather they are created to be modern classics as our philosophy is very much based on being built to last. With its design and extensive art collection, we wanted it to have a sense of individuality and excitement, and it has been proven that whether it be relaxing in the Cigar Bar, having dinner on one of our terraces, or partying at Cherry on the Rooftop, the Lebanese were ready for it.
</p><h4>Efficient and well-trained human capital is one of the key success factors in the hospitality industry. What is Le Gray's approach to human resources?</h4><p>
	<span></span>This is my favorite area. I love the staff. For me, taking a team and training, inspiring, and leading them is one of my greatest passions. I love the Lebanese, their attitude to service, and their attitude to life. They have made creating Le Gray one of the greatest pleasures I have had experienced in creating a new hotel. It is a joy to see how they work as a professional, closely-knit team, and they are truly our secret weapon.
</p><h4>What trends in Lebanon's boutique hotel sector can you identify and what is your vision for the future of this segment over the medium term?</h4><p>
	<span></span>I don't think that boutique hotels in any way are a trend. It is absolutely a change of desire on behalf of the traveler to have a much greater sense of individuality and originality. It is now possible to travel to almost anywhere in the world and be able to source individual, unusual, creative, and often privately owned and much loved hotels. There is something special about private ownership, which not surprisingly is where so many of the great hotels of the world began and where the pride in personal and special service is the prime focus. At Campbell Gray Hotels, we are aware that we must be ready for the arrival of the intelligent guest. We focus on issues relating to the environment and believe that the future of hotels is about providing great comfort without excess; I never believe that excess is luxurious and neither does the intelligent guest.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of UNESCO's recently launched #unite4heritage campaign in Lebanon, in terms of raising awareness and increasing protection of diversity and cultural heritage threatened by violence and sectarian discourse?</h4><p><span></span>In May 2015, I visited Lebanon and seized the opportunity to launch the #unite4heritage campaign in the National Museum of Beirut, which is a symbol of the greatness of this region and its diversity. In reaction to sectarian propaganda, this campaign uses the power of social media to create a global movement to support the protection of cultural heritage. To fight violent extremism, we must stand together and show that all cultures are linked, while explaining the value of heritage and resisting all forms of hatred. UNESCO relies on Lebanon to take this campaign forward with its unique social fabric and uncompromising defense of freedom of expression and with its committed and educated young people. Lebanon has already proven its commitment to peace by receiving hundreds of thousands of refugees as neighboring conflicts wreak social and economic havoc, and has also played a vital role in the fight against the illicit traffic of cultural property. </p><h4>What steps are being taken to strengthen the work of the UNESCO Office in Beirut? </h4><p><span></span>We have recently launched a new project, “Enhancing Access to Secondary Education and Quality Results for Youth Affected by the Syria Crisis (EASE initiative)," as part of UNESCO's new strategy called “Bridging Learning Gaps for Youth." By collaborating with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education, UNESCO Beirut Office will support tuition for more than 1,500 secondary education students that will also benefit of preparatory and remedial classes. At the same time, teachers and administrators will benefit from capacity development activities with a focus on psycho-social support, inclusive education, ICTs in education. In collaboration with the ministry, UNESCO Beirut Office has also been implementing the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) to reintegrate out of school children in Lebanon. In the context of the UNESCO Regional Project on Cultural Dialogue funded by Saudi Arabia, the Beirut Office has implemented several capacity building activities, including the coaching of certified trainers on dialogue skills, and developing a credit based University Course now adopted in six Lebanese universities. UNESCO-Beirut Office and the Council for Development and Reconstruction signed an agreement to provide advisory services and high-level technical assistance to the Directorate General of Antiquities at the Ministry of Culture. UNESCO will monitor the execution of archaeological works in the World Heritage sites of Tyr and Baalbek, respecting their outstanding universal values, integrity, and authenticity. In the same context, prioritizing youth concerns is a key objective for UNESCO in Lebanon. UNESCO is integrating youth priorities in all its programs, and is trying to build an effective partnership with them. </p><h4>What activities and events will be launched in Lebanon in the framework of the organization's 70th anniversary?</h4><p><span></span>The celebration of UNESCO's 70th anniversary will honor the organization's achievements and actions throughout the world to strengthen the foundations for lasting peace and sustainable development, through education, culture, sciences, information, and communication. The Lebanese National Commission is organizing a series of activities in December. An international conference on "Safeguarding heritage and cultural diversity in times of crisis" will be organized at the UNESCO Palace in Beirut along with a series of events taking place at the closing ceremony. Students of UNESCO associated schools will present a show featuring folkloric dances from all five continents and songs illustrating the values of UNESCO. There will be an exhibition of drawings around the theme “Describing UNESCO," and a competition will be addressed to university students on producing a documentary about the Organization. Other initiatives include a painting seminar on the themes and values of UNESCO and a culinary festival.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What mechanisms have been activated by the Ministry to protect and preserve Lebanon's cultural heritage?</h4><p>In Lebanon, there are two types of cultural heritage: tangible and intangible. Tangible cultural heritage refers to archaeological sites and patrimonial buildings. On that level, the ministry is taking all the necessary measures to maintain and preserve these sites while closely cooperating with the UNESCO. As for the intangible, we succeeded to enroll Zajal, a traditional poetry form, on the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage List which would protect this form of traditional art. All in all, the ministry has adopted a policy to develop and promote Lebanese culture and arts through a variety of events while submitting drafts of bills and legislations for that same purpose.</p><h4>What measures does the ministry implement to create synergies between culture and education, and other areas in the economy?</h4><p><span></span>Arts in Lebanon are well developed, the Lebanese movie industry is booming, while Beirut increasingly hosts cultural events. Artistic and cultural festivals have abounded this summer and have spread out across Lebanon. Archaeological sites and museums have received a significant number of visitors. All these cultural and artistic undertakings have contributed to the Lebanese economy. The Ministry of Culture has worked to financially support cinema. In addition to that, Lebanon's publishing industry is one of the most developed and active in the region, especially in the field of children's books. These books are widely distributed across Arab countries. They are published in Arabic, French, and English, and Lebanon hosts the French book fair, an impressive step for a small country like ours. </p><h4>What major cultural and tourist initiatives can be expected to take place in Lebanon in 2015-16?</h4><p><span></span>One of our major events was launched just recently—a virtual museum of contemporary art. We launched the virtual museum to exhibit the Ministry of Culture's collection of paintings. The ministry owns around 1,500 paintings of famous Lebanese painters, and the virtual museum is a retrospective of contemporary Lebanese art with commentaries in four languages; these multi-lingual texts aim at drawing the Lebanese diaspora together and keeping it involved in Lebanese culture. It is designed to first promote our culture, second to attract tourists, and third to enhance relations with the Lebanese diaspora. Language, the arts, and archeology can all contribute to tying closer bonds between Lebanon and the Lebanese diaspora. In order to further promote and display our historical heritage, the Ministry of Culture launched a small museum, a permanent exhibition with many valuable artifacts- at the Cedar lounge (MEA) of the Rafic Hariri International airport. The Ministry is currently working on extending this exhibition to the whole airport. On the other hand, the Ministry has also launched a national prize in Arabic literature for the best and most imaginative prose work of the year in Lebanon. Add to that that the Ministry is collaborating with a consultancy Company in order to launch a roadmap to cover the next decade for Culture in Lebanon. Sponsoring several cultural activities in different fields taking place in the country (cinema, literature…) is another of the Ministry's initiatives. In 2016, the Ministry will undertake the project of refurbishing the typical Byblos House and turn it into a museum.</p><h4>Looking forward to 2016, what are your biggest aspirations, as the Minister of Culture?</h4><p><span></span>As I told you, we are working on a road map for the Ministry of Culture for the next decade. The Ministry is collaborating with professionals—one is a consultancy company, and the other is a cultural association. All these stakeholders are deploying efforts to present our vision to the Lebanese government along with specific projects.<span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to Shadi A. Karam, the Basel III requirements and fierce competition in Lebanon's banking sector are likely to lead to further consolidations. What opportunities do you see in that regard?</h4><p><span></span>Basel III requirements are summarized by capital (strengthening capital through common equity and creating conservation buffers), risk coverage (more rigorous credit analyses, substantial strengthening of the counterparty credit risk framework, etc.), containing leverage (non-risk-based leverage ratio that includes off-balance sheet exposures will serve as a backstop to the risk-based capital requirement), risk management and supervision, and market discipline. These requirements, when added to fierce market competition, trigger further consolidations in the banking industry. The policy of the US Treasury aimed at enhancing compliance is a key driver toward consolidation, especially due to substantial additional cost burden on small players.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the development of Lebanon in terms of corporate governance standards?</h4><p><span></span>It is a little slow, but definitely sure. Banque du Liban continues to be the main driver of the governance initiative, through a large series of regulations, directives, and guidelines aimed at enhancing corporate governance. The Capital Markets Authority is launching another series of regulations aimed at preserving the integrity of the capital markets and protecting the consumers. There are three law enactment projects that are outstanding and have not yet passed by the parliament, regarding transfer of cross border cash, anti-money laundering, and tax compliance. Lebanon has to seriously consider passing these laws to preserve its dealings with the international financial system. As anywhere, the private sector has demonstrated its ability to abide by higher levels and standards of governance through adopting internal policies, directives, and governance principles that are aligned with international standards. It makes me proud to name in this regard Bank Audi, which is not a client of the Firm, FFA Private Bank, Malia Group, and Africell Group which are clients of the firm.</p><h4>How does AJA cater to multinational clients?</h4><p><span></span>AJA, like many other reputable local law Firms, provides high quality services to multinational clients. The legal industry in Lebanon hosts a large number of legal counsels holding degrees from reputable US, UK, and French universities, and have benefitted from foreign experience enabling them to service adequately multinational clients.</p><h4>What advice would you give to a foreign investor seeking opportunities in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon is the only democracy in the MENA region (other than Cyprus and Israel), and has substantial needs and opportunities in the telecom infrastructure and energy sectors. Lebanon enjoys a great banking sector, skilled labor, and quality living environment, and accordingly can serve as a key platform for global corporations wishing to carry out business in Lebanon and in the region.</p><h4>What is AJA's main focus as well as expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>We aim to pursue AJA's expansion plan aimed at reaching a size of 100 attorneys in three to four years (we are currently 46), with a key focus on vital business areas for the economy, mainly banking, finance, energy, telecoms, real estate development, media, and governance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are UNESCO Beirut Office's main areas of action as a regional bureau?</h4><p><span></span>In the field of education, with the emerging challenges brought about by instability and armed conflicts confronting the region, promoting and sustaining equitable and inclusive education is at the heart of what UNESCO does in the Arab region. As such, UNESCO invests considerable financial and human resources to support Arab Member States to realize their national education development aspirations, particularly in countries affected, directly and indirectly, by conflicts. Safeguarding cultural heritage particularly in Syria is another priority for UNESCO. At the same time, UNESCO works on promoting science for the benefit of society in the Arab region. Social and ethical dimensions are also central to UNESCO, as it strives to reach out to the most vulnerable segments of society and to contribute to peace, human rights, and poverty eradication through a human rights-based approach in all its fields. At the regional level, UNESCO is implementing programs and activities focusing on advocacy and sensitization on gender equality and promoting gender mainstreaming. UNESCO also is the only UN agency with a specific mandate to protect freedom of expression and information. The Communication and Information Sector's program at UNESCO in places emphasis on freedom of expression, unbound access to information, safety of journalists in the Middle East, and media awareness among the youth. The Middle East is notably one of the most dangerous regions in the world for journalists. As instability arises and persists throughout the Arab States, the region becomes increasingly risky for journalists, reporters, and media personnel. Finally, as youth in the Arab States are calling for more decisive roles in legislation and in the government process, UNESCO has responded by creating events to promote a greater involvement for youth in planning and decision making. </p><h4>What are the main highlights of the recent agreement UNESCO Beirut Office signed with The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR)?</h4><p><span></span>UNESCO and CDR have signed an agreement (UDAS) to assist the government by providing advisory services and high-level technical assistance to the Ministry of Culture/Directorate General of Antiquities, with respect to the two World Heritage sites of Tyre and Baalbek in Lebanon. Implemented by international and national specialists with extensive experience in Cultural Resource Management and Preservation, UNESCO will monitor the project design and execution CDR's Cultural Heritage and Urban Development (CHUD) project. For this purpose, the CDR, the DGA, and the Italian Cooperation Development Office have coordinated their action together with UNESCO for launching the UNESCO Documentation &amp; Advisory Services (UDAS) project. The UDAS aims to help the DGA in organizing high level technical workshops dedicated to the works in both the Baalbek and Tyre archaeological world heritage sites. These workshops will monitor the execution of works respecting the sites' outstanding universal values, their integrity and authenticity, in respect with international standards of practice.</p><h4>What are UNESCO Beirut Office's main priorities for the years to come?</h4><p><span></span>The priority of the UNESCO Office in the next 15 years is to support Arab Member States to progress towards achieving the global goal, of “Ensuring equitable and inclusive education for all and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all," though UNESCO's areas of expertise, in partnership with the UN family and all the partners. Our second priority is to respond to the many political and societal upheavals and transformations the Arab world has undergone in the past 15 years. It may safely be said that almost no country in the region has gone untouched or been unaffected by one crisis/conflict or another. Therefore, UNESCO will do its utmost to contribute to the resilience building of  national governments and their citizens through contextually relevant, rights-based multi-sectoral program.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the last year in terms of overall tourism activity and what do you expect for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Stability has facilitated activity, which has grown since June and July 2014. Tourism has increased almost 25%, which was the highest rate in the region. Of course, this increase has come after a substantial deterioration between 2011 and 2014. We have also recorded even higher rates of Lebanese living in the Gulf region, Europe, and Africa returning home for vacation, who were not visiting in large numbers between 2012 and 2014. Both foreign tourists and the Lebanese are coming to Lebanon for the holidays. We can say fortunately that we had a high rate of increase despite a sluggish or difficult political situation. Lebanon has a degree of immunity to political problems. Of course, the threat of terrorism is present all over, but in Lebanon our security forces have managed well.</p><p><span></span>There has also been excellent activity in restaurants and exceptional activity in civil society; non-governmental agencies and the private sector have a remarkable dynamism, which prove that Lebanon is rich in terms of civilized values, liberty, and culture. There are more than 100 events scheduled between July 15th and the first week of September. Tourists are very much influenced by Lebanese expats, so when they decide to come with their families it encourages a lot of tourists. </p><h4>What are the most important initiatives promoting Lebanon as a tourism destination that the Ministry of Tourism is currently involved in?</h4><p><span></span>We are working on a program for religious tourism, which should be ready by the end of 2015. We have a touristic program being designed for the diaspora, which should be ready at the end of the summer. We have a particular focus on a five-year plan for rural tourism. Today, rural tourism doesn't represent more than 8% of tourism in Lebanon, but it has the potential to increase within three years to reach 20%. We also have an ambitious program, which was launched by the UN World Tourism Organization, called the Road of the Phoenicians. This is being designed modeled on the Silk Road. We are also focusing on medical tourism. We aim to control, evolve, and monitor traditional tourism, conferences, businesses, shopping, the central district, and traditional mountains. We are building programs for medium- to long-term benefit, and even if there is another downslope in the sector, we will continue to work because the potential of tourism in Lebanon is very big whether it be leisure, adventure, cultural, conferences, and we are preparing the infrastructure.</p><h4>Where do you see the untapped potential in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>Of course, 2016 will reap the benefits of the work we are doing in 2015. One of our projects is Byblos, the Arab tourism capital, which would benefit all of the bay regions. The main challenge is the road infrastructure needs to be improved. These regions have a lot of potential. In 2016 we plan to have an Arab Tourist Minister in Lebanon and to have programs ready. We are planning a mini conference for tourism in Lebanon in 2016, either in the first or second quarter. Some of the regions are being developed, for example the Beqaa Valley has huge potential. Even some regions that are handicapped by security fears, especially on the border with Syria, we encourage these regions to organize themselves for future potential. We are working now on Tripoli, where I plan to organize a visit with journalists. We are doing some work on regional cuisine as well. NGOs have been creating programs geared towards young people. Another challenge is we need to change the mentality of the tour operators. Between 2011 and 2014 they sold outside of Lebanon. We need to make a huge effort to promote and sell Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of R&amp;D and innovative technology at Saint George Hospital University Medical Center?</h4><p><span></span>We do not conduct a significant amount of clinical or applied research because of a lack of funding. We do not fund research ourselves, and the pharmaceutical companies do not foot the bill unless it is in their interest, therefore the research that is being conducted is very minimal and limited. Advanced technology is a separate issue—our doctors and our senior staff are our ears and eyes, and they travel a lot, attending conferences and visiting other hospitals.</p><h4><span></span>Is it difficult to stay competitive with so many hospitals and clinics opening in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>It could be a challenge, however we are not focused on what they are doing, we only concentrate on ourselves and on delivering the best that we can. If someone is delivering the service better than us, they may have better resources than us, but we are not in competition with them. We know our resources, financial and otherwise, and we operate accordingly.</p><h4><span></span>How would you describe the relationship between the Lebanese universities and clinics?</h4><p><span></span>It has been proven that the best hospitals are the academic medical centers. When hospitals are not linked to a university-based medical school, the service over time becomes commercial. The Lebanese University Medical School disperses its students over many hospitals, which are not university medical centers. In reality there are only three or four academic medical centers in Lebanon, while the rest are teaching hospitals.</p><h4><span></span>What challenges are facing the healthcare sector in Lebanon and what is your assessment of its development?</h4><p><span></span>One major challenge is the general lack of governance in this sector. Everything in the country—including healthcare—is based on individual efforts at all levels, both academic and non-academic. As a result, the sector suffers from a lack of a unified strategy and common vision as to the future of healthcare services. But despite these challenges, Lebanon remains well-positioned for its excellent services in healthcare and universities. This is the case when successful individualistic behaviors take over conformity. The literacy level in Lebanon is generally elevated and the Lebanese at large are well educated. As such, individuals try to improve their own niche or area of expertise. This is why collectively the Lebanese are flourishing. If it were planned, it would not have succeeded. Thirty years ago, they brought into the country a specialist in government economics. He spent a year in Lebanon, and finally concluded that he could not do anything and recommended to remain as we are, adding that if we would organize the health sector could fail.</p><h4><span></span>How would you assess Lebanon's potential to become a medical hub for the region?</h4><p><span></span>Do not underestimate Arab countries' capabilities. Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have high-quality hospitals, equipment, and training of doctors and health workers. If you look at the admissions at our big four hospitals, patients are predominantly Lebanese, there are not many non-Lebanese being referred from Arab countries to come to Lebanon. Over the past decade the political situation, coupled with the unsteady and often insecure climate, may have affected the potential to bring over patients from other neighboring countries. Unfortunately, health tourism has not succeeded here. Our health tourism should be addressed to Arab countries, but this is not happening. If patients go to Europe and take their families, they are crippled if they do not speak the language, while if they come to Lebanon, the families can speak Arabic everywhere. Regardless of that they still go to Europe, not Lebanon, and this is a huge missed opportunity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Turkish Airlines is a European airline with the highest number of originating destinations in the Middle East. What factors differentiate your airline from the Middle East carriers?</h4><p>Due to the geostrategic position of Istanbul—a city that is within reach of major cities in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa in just two to four hours—Turkish Airlines naturally gains a big advantage in respect to other carriers in the Middle East. </p><h4><span></span>What are some of the opportunities and challenges you encounter in the Lebanese market?</h4><p><span></span>The exemption of the visa regime between Turkey and Lebanon has boosted traffic between the two countries, but the instability in the region has affected the incoming traffic to Lebanon. </p><h4><span></span>In 2014, the total number of passengers carried by Turkish Airlines increased by 13.3%, reaching 54.7 million passengers. What destinations have enjoyed the biggest popularity and how would you assess Beirut's performance?</h4><p><span></span>Every year Turkish Airlines announces new destinations and ranks number one in terms of country destinations flown. For the past few years the Lebanese market enjoyed services provided to Sao Paulo, Los Angeles, and Montreal with Turkish Airlines. With three daily flights, Turkish Airlines' Beirut office provides its passengers with minimum connection time and a wide network choice that has reputation in the Lebanese market. </p><h4><span></span>What strategies do you implement to stay competitive in the Lebanese market, and is Turkish Airlines undertaking any initiatives aimed at increasing the interest in Lebanon as a tourist destination?</h4><p><span></span>Turkish Airlines conducts many advertisement campaigns in the Lebanese market to increase its brand awareness. Furthermore, Turkish Airlines organizes family trips to various destinations in Turkey and abroad for its agents and corporate customers in which they have the chance to explore new destinations for their customers. Unfortunately, due to the unstable situation in the region that is affecting Lebanon, the incoming traffic has decreased. However, as the situation improves, Turkish Airlines will take initiative in promoting Lebanon as a tourist destination.</p><h4><span></span>Which new routes or regions is Turkish Airlines prioritizing as part of its expansion strategy?</h4><p><span></span>Turkish Airlines is planning further growth in Africa in 2015 with at least six new destinations. Turkish Airlines already has the largest network in Africa among foreign carriers, overtaking Air France and Emirates, as it has added a staggering 25 African destinations over the last three years. By the end of 2015, Turkish Airlines will have at least 45 destinations in its African network across 30 countries. North Africa continues to account for most of its African capacity but Turkish Airlines also has established a large presence in East, Central, and West Africa. Turkish Airlines is able to enter relatively thin underserved African markets by offering a myriad of connections to Europe, Asia, and the Americas. Narrow-body aircraft have been the driver of the African expansion strategy as it has used 737-900ERs to open up destinations as far as seven hours from Istanbul.</p><h4><span></span>What is your main focus for the year ahead as far as the Lebanese market is concerned?</h4><p><span></span>For Lebanon's market we are seeking to enlarge all our flights with wider aircrafts to be able to provide extra capacity for our passengers and provide them with a unique service experience on our new wide-bodied aircrafts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[no-time-to-waste]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main areas of Batco Group's expertise?</h4><p><span></span>Batco Group is a family of companies offering a wide range of engineering, construction, and solid waste management and related technical services for the public and private sectors. We started off as public works company and contractors, and we then developed into service providers. In the early 1990s we broadened our vision towards the future and ventured into the environmental services through Lavajet, an Italian company specializing in solid waste management. Besides waste management we are also involved in water treatment through the acquisition of majority shares in EMIT, an Italian company operating worldwide within the water, wastewater, solid waste, and energy production from renewable sources. </p><h4>Since its inception Batco Group has developed many impressive projects throughout several countries. What are the largest goals and aspirations that govern your activities?</h4><p><span></span>We are committed to working for the public good, and that is our ultimate mission: urban excellence, urban betterment, and urban development. The core of our business is comprised of infrastructure works—dams, tunnels, water, sewage treatment, etc. We work not only in Lebanon but also have operations and projects in Turkey, the UAE, Egypt, Bahrain, Italy, Nigeria, Oman, and elsewhere. </p><h4>What is Batco Group's further expansion strategy?</h4><p><span></span>Batco's next challenge is Saudi Arabia. We have started tendering in Saudi Arabia, and there is a lot of work that we can do there. It's a big, stable market, and even though we have not yet tapped into it, we are committed to getting in there. Other than that, we're also expanding in Africa. We're putting in new proposals in Liberia and expanding in Mozambique. In terms of which have been our biggest and most successful markets, the UAE has always been a big market for us. They have very large, constant, and ambitious infrastructure programs that we have been a major part of. </p><h4>What role do technology and innovation play at Batco Group?</h4><p><span></span>We can't sustain our business without constant innovation and the use and application of the newest technologies. It's a tough market. You could have the best cost control, the best prices, but you can't stay in the market without technology and remain profitable. You have to invest in the best there is. You also have to invest in the best people to provide the best services. So technology, research, and innovation is key.</p><h4>What is your assessment of the development of the infrastructure sector in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>We're very far behind, due mainly to issues of political stability. It's been lacking infrastructure for a long time in all areas—roads, sewage, water treatment, everything. There is no real commitment for development here. The bureaucratic process is too long and difficult.</p><h4>How has Batco Group contributed to the development of the Lebanese infrastructure?</h4><p><span></span>Over the years, Batco has built a reputation of excellence and uncompromising commitment to developing a proper environment for successful and sustainable projects. We've participated in most of the infrastructure projects in Lebanon. We've invested a lot of time and money into Lebanon, and some projects haven't even been paid for two or three years. We've done mostly water-related projects. We also have extensive waste treatment work, like the Zahle landfill. </p><h4>What is Batco Group's medium-term development strategy as well as main objectives for 2015?</h4><p><span></span>The government is launching two major waste treatment concessions, which our company Lavajet will be tendering for. These are big projects. We'll take the risk, invest, and give a good proposal. Another project that interests us is for building wind farms and producing electricity from wind. Besides these projects, our dam construction projects will continue, and the Mseilha Dam is due to be launched in 2015. Hopefully the government will be able to execute and undertake these projects, and hopefully we'll be involved in them all. Now, after having acquired EMIT, we have this whole sector ahead of us in industrial water and sewage treatment projects. EMIT operates in Romania, Turkey, Croatia, Egypt, among other countries, so we also want to do projects in Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In terms of service, how does Maersk Line work to be the best in the sector?</h4><p><span></span>For Maersk Line it has been an ongoing process to deliver better service. The latest change we implemented in terms of global service was through collaboration between Maersk and MSC. We have east and west trade service, and this is by far the biggest alliance we have in terms of sharing vessels. Beirut has always been looked at as an interesting location for the line. The industry is changing, and every line will be looking for value differentiators. In this sense the services will be shared with MSC, and we need to strive for something different.</p><h4>How has the volume of containers through the Port of Beirut and the Port of Tripoli changed over the past few years?</h4><p><span></span>The Port of Tripoli is not considered a main container port as most of the containers are going to The Port of Beirut since it has an advanced container terminal. The volumes are definitely bigger than they were a few years back, and this is not just due to growth in the market. The situation in Syria has caused a shift from land transportation to sea transportation, and that has caused some growth although it is still slow because it is diverted cargo. The market has not been growing 5% or 7% like other markets. </p><h4>How does Lebanon's negative balance of trade influence Maersk Line's operations?</h4><p><span></span>It puts more pressure on the lines because the costs will be higher. Eventually when it is not balanced, the movement of empty containers is not as lucrative as those that are full. The market is still beneficial though because of its size, and the cost at Beirut is not significantly high. Beirut is also serving the main services of Europe so it does not require a specific route. However, we are constantly looking at how to increase exports. So far we have a good market share on the export side in an attempt to create more balance for us. </p><h4>What trends do you identify in the regional maritime industry?</h4><p><span></span>The region has changed significantly, and there have been a lot of things going on all around us. Turkey has the highest growing ratio in the region, yet Syria is a different story as it is now out of the scope. Egypt has shown the highest profits in the last year, and for Lebanon, we took advantage of what was happening around us to a certain extent. The industry is working towards stepping into help move things towards positive growth. </p><h4>How does the maritime sector in Lebanon compare to other transportation hubs in which you operate worldwide in terms of infrastructure?</h4><p><span></span>The Port of Beirut is well adapted for the region, and the technology there is advanced. We do not have any issues in Beirut, and they operate a new generation of vessels. The challenge comes outside of the port in terms of infrastructure. We get customer complaints about not getting things quickly because of traffic jams and electricity problems. These issues affect production and cost of production. Infrastructure is doing well in some places, but in other places there is still a lot to do. </p><h4>How do you assess the current regulatory framework in the Lebanese logistics industry?</h4><p><span></span>Customs Administration is working on several changes, most recently with cargo being inspected. Some see it as a positive approach, whereas other see the implications being unfavorable, mainly for the traders. The customs and port administration are working on digitizing more of the systems. There is still a lot to be done, and most of the regulations date from 1940.</p><h4>What steps should be taken to enhance the Lebanese logistics sector?</h4><p><span></span>The sector is divided into two parts, between shipping lines and forward orders. Every segment has its own syndicates and chambers. Every part of the industry is trying to work on simplifying processes as it is benefit for us and the customers as well. We always see obstacles as catalyst to find solutions and make things more efficient. For example, digitizing the delivery order will help with this. Unfortunately it is not entirely possible because we still have to obtain a stamp and signature, and this is outdated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon was one of the first countries to implement the Get Airports Ready for Disaster (GARD) program. Could you tell us about the importance of this initiative? </h4><p><span></span>GARD is a program developed jointly by UNDP and Deutsche Post DHL to assist countries in assessing the capacity of their airports to handle the additional volume of cargo that would materialize in the event of a natural or humanitarian disaster. Aviation and airport professional employed by Deutsche Post DHL have designed the training material and the airport assessment format. The same aviation &amp; airport professionals delivered the training and assisted with the airport assessment. The program assists the authorities in ensuring that the airport is prepared for a disaster and is a way for DHL to put its expertise to work for the good of the country.  It is also a great honor for us to be involved in the program and working alongside the Lebanese Army and Civil Defense, Civil Aviation, UNDP, and Middle East Airlines. </p><h4>Considering DHL's global reach, what importance does the company give Lebanon within its international portfolio?</h4><p><span></span>From a global perspective Lebanon is a medium sized country. However, because we belong to a global network which is committed to a consistently high level of service in every country we operate, it is important that the level of service a customer receives in Lebanon is as good or better than the service received in a large country. DHL Lebanon is committed to providing industry leading service levels and continues to make the investments that enable us to support our customers and our global network.  Customers in Lebanon who arrange for collection of their consignments before noon will benefit from a next day delivery to most destinations in Europe and the Middle East. That is just one example of how DHL is providing industry leading service levels in Lebanon. Lebanon's service has been further enhanced by the commencement of dedicated DHL flights. DHL began flying a Boeing 757 Freighter with a cargo capacity of 32 tons into Beirut once a week in 2013.  As volumes increased additional flights were added and we now fly up to three times per week.  The flight provides customers with a direct connection to both our global air network, and the Middle East road network.  The flights support our core Time Definite or what is commonly referred to as “courier" or “express" products as well as our Economy Select product.  Economy Select  is a door to door product designed for shipments over 150 kg to and from countries in the  Middle East.</p><h4>What areas is DHL investing in the most and on which services have you been focusing most of your growth?</h4><p><span></span>We have, over the years, created a strong network of service points—we operate a dedicated airport facility that was recently expanded.  We also established a logistics center in the free zone over 10 years ago.  So in terms of facilities and infrastructure we are where we want to be.  Our focus is now mainly on using our local and global infrastructure to better meet our customers' needs.  Of course we continue to invest in our people, technology and training but we are not planning any major infrastructure projects this year. Our core business is still express documents and packages; what we refer to as our Time Definite Product Portfolio, and that is where we focus most of our attention.  The growth in these products is very strong as customers continue to rely on DHL to deliver their documents and parcels in the fastest most secure fashion.  </p><h4>How would you assess Lebanon's potential to become a regional hub in the Middle East?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon could easily become a regional hub; that is something that we have always looked forward to capitalizing on. Lebanon has a lot going for it.  Geographically the country is well positioned.  The airport has capacity to handle more cargo.  The seaport has seen a major transformation and is now well-equipped to handle large container vessels and the workforce is highly skilled and multilingual. All the necessary elements are in place.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of Cisco Systems' business performance over the past year?</h4><p><span></span>For the last few quarters we have been achieving solid results time and again, as well as showing growth in every aspect of the business. This is proof that our strategy is working, and our customers are taking notice of the change of pace. We move forward with new technology or expand on the technology that we already have in place. We are emerging from the competition due to the elevation we bring to the market and the integration of the different elements of technology. We are focusing on integrating our industry-leading products in every category and this is delivering focused business outcomes. Every initiative that we undertake, we have been able to deliver.</p><h4>With the increasing number of cyber-attacks, how do Cisco Systems' solutions help businesses to protect their networks?</h4><p><span></span>We are one of the leading companies in the world that provide security services. We have seen an increase of 14% YoY from 2003 to 2014 and this is the highest average according to our Cisco 2015 annual security report. We are actively building a necessary defense mechanism. We cover every aspect of the network, so we have a wide portfolio of products, from solutions to access control policies, manual protection, email security, firewall security, network security, prevention, security management, and so on. If there is a new virus or some other risk, our systems immediately react. We have been successful in securing organizations of all sizes for years. Our firewall is one of the most successful products that we provide. Now we are also moving into data analytics, so we will be able to segregate some of the incoming traffic and learn how to address it. </p><h4>How do you assess the potential for progress in the Lebanese ICT industry over the medium term, as well as Lebanon's potential to become a regional technology hub?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon has always strived to develop the ICT sector to the highest level and there is no reason why we cannot continue to strive for it. We missed certain opportunities in the past, but that has to do with the availability of bandwidth, the priorities of the government, and the instability of the country. Nothing stops us from becoming a hub now. We continue to realize Lebanon's potential, and we portray the country in this light. We have the human capacity, the languages, and the technical skills. We need the support of all the economic and regulatory elements to achieve our goals. </p><h4>What is your outlook for e-governance and the digital economy in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>Digitization is vital. However we don't have clarity in this regard from the government. The private sector doesn't want to wait for the government, but we have been engaged with government leaders for transforming the country into a digitized country. There are a lot of isolated engagements to digitize the environments, mainly in the private sector. That will eventually push the government to accelerate more, but it will be challenging only private entities are offering us the services we need. However there are many projects that are underway towards smart environments, smart cities, and smart planning.</p><h4>What are your targets for the second half of 2015?</h4><p><span></span>At this stage, the plan is to build an integrated country platform and move towards digitization—not necessarily in terms of having a revenue stream, but in terms of having a clear plan to push the government to digitization or a transformation towards the best use of the internet in support of businesses. Another priority is to develop our Cisco team and our interns, in order to get the youth to understand there is an educational and career path in this field. We want to promote Cisco locally in the country, because people want to know how things develop and how it will impact their business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the importance of Lebanon to Microsoft in the context of the company's global reach?</h4><p>Lebanon is a gateway for innovation in the region and a base for talent. Lebanon has proven to be resilient and even with the current geopolitical situation, we are growing year after year compared to other countries around us. Lebanese IT companies have been successful in taking their services not only to the Gulf and Africa regions, but to Europe as well. Microsoft is helping the country keep a leading edge when it comes to technology and innovation, and empowering its citizens, businesses and educational institutions with programs like TechDays, Imagine Cup and MACH (Microsoft Academy for College Hires). Microsoft is pioneering the next generation technology in Lebanon.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about Microsoft's relationship with the Lebanese universities?</h4><p><span></span>Education is one of Microsoft's main pillars. We work closely with the Ministry of Education and Higher Education in Lebanon as well as public and private organizations to drive transformation in the school and faculty experience through technology. The well-established education system in the country is fertile ground for Microsoft to achieve our overarching mission to help students and educators realize their full potential through strategies and programs such as Microsoft Global Forum, Microsoft Partners in Learning, Imagine Cup, IT Academy, Student Advantage, and DreamSpark. We also support entrepreneurs and start-ups through programs tailored specifically for them like BizSpark, TechDays, and DevCamps.</p><h4>Considering the country's solid education system, how would you assess Lebanon's potential to become a regional technology hub?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon is an incubator for talent; add to this the rock-solid education system and the people with the right exposure and ideas, and you get a country full of potential and possibilities. Microsoft is working closely with government entities, individuals, businesses and educational institutions to help establish Lebanon as a technology and innovation hub in the region.</p><h4>What makes the Lebanese market unique and which of Microsoft's products generate the most sales in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>Although a continuing economic slowdown is being reported within the context of the adverse spillover effects of the regional conflict, the analysis of economic sectors report an increase in productivity of small and medium enterprises flourishing under these circumstances compared to bigger enterprises: small and medium business and entrepreneurs are the hope of the country. This is how we build a thriving local partnership ecosystem that is at the core of our support for the local IT economy. The right tools and partnerships can help people connect to valuable skills and new jobs, help businesses grow and secure future stability for the country. Large enterprises and SMEs alike are all moving towards the cloud. Many of our partners in Lebanon started out as young startups and we helped them develop their businesses and take their offering outside the Lebanese borders to the whole Middle East, North Africa and even Europe.</p><h4>How would you describe the success of Windows 8 in the region and specifically in Lebanon, as well as the adoption rate in terms of both users and software developers?</h4><p><span></span>Windows 8 was a complete transformation for people to adopt. Windows 8.1 came after we really listened to everyone and made a lot of changes to adapt to what people wanted. Here you have to divide between consumers and enterprises when it comes to adoption. On the consumer side, the adoption is much better because in general, Windows 8 is coming with new tablets that have touch capabilities. On the enterprise side, the adoption is gradual because you have more testing and compatibility that has to be done, but I believe it's progressing in the right direction.</p><h4>What other steps is Microsoft taking to enhance its competitiveness in the local market?</h4><p><span></span>We are in the process of introducing Windows 10, which is currently available for review, with a wide range of experiences designed to usher in a new era of more personal computing. Windows 10 will be delivered as a service to offer a safe, innovative and updated experience for the supported lifetime of the device. As the world's first holographic computing platform, Windows 10 enables new ways to communicate, create and explore that are more personal and human.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Ministry has recently confirmed a $6.4 million loan to help create startups. How is this program going to support the Lebanese youth in establishing technology startups?</h4><p><span></span>The Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project's (MIEP) aim is to strengthen innovation and entrepreneurship in the Lebanese mobile internet ecosystem. The project will foster economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness in the economy, through the creation of a culture of entrepreneurship, the development of a pipeline of startup projects, and the enhancement of the talent pool's skills to meet the global standards of the ICT industry. The project will extend the use of ICT tools, particularly mobile internet, to traditionally competitive industries in Lebanon (such as the creative industries, media, advertising, and banking) in order to increase their competitiveness in international markets where the use of ICT tools is prevalent.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to increase internet penetration among the Lebanese population?</h4><p><span></span>The MoT will soon be announcing a strategic three-to-five-year plan, where the access network—the famous “last mile"—represents a major part. The planned access network allows full coverage and reachability, scalability, as well as enhanced broadband speeds and latency.</p><h4>How do you assess the reaction of the communications sector to the population boom?</h4><p><span></span>The challenge is actually broader than just a population boom, it resides also in technological booms with much shorter time frames. We stretched the network capabilities to their optimum to cope with these booms. The new plan has been developed to allow a true technology leap</p><h4>How do you assess people's receptiveness to mobile locations in Lebanon and what is needed to further increase the mobile penetration?</h4><p><span></span>In Lebanon, we encounter very little resistance to site installations. Actually, people are knowledgeable that all international studies have not confirmed that mobile installations are harmful. On the other hand, these installations represent a non-negligible source of income to those who accept towers/antennas in their properties. Lebanon has reached 92% mobile penetration, which is quite significant considering the economic and political situation. So any additional 1% requires extreme effort and struggle. Nevertheless, new plans and packages are launched during the year so as to address specific groups such as the young, the elderly, specific professional categories, the military, and foreigners. Also, we have significantly reduced prices in June 2014, which resulted in an increase in penetration and traffic. A noticeable increase however happened on the mobile data landscape, whereby we expanded from 25% to 75% penetration—in other words, 75% of SIM card holders use data.</p><h4>The Lebanese telecommunication industry is becoming increasingly appealing to investors. What is your vision of the role of the private sector in this industry?</h4><p><span></span>The private sector holds a key role in the Lebanese telecommunications landscape, and our intention and strategy is oriented towards empowering it where possible so as to keep both public and private sectors healthy. As the MoT, we keep track of our increasingly demanding market. At the same time, we accept and embrace the fact that the private sector possesses key advantages such as agility, committed performance, and services through service level agreements (SLAs). In the 2002 Telecommunications Law, the vision is working towards a fully comprehensive PPP by building “Liban Telecom." We are currently working on bringing it back to the front scene. As you may understand, the current political situation does not help much. </p><h4>What can be done to nurture talent in the ICT sector in Lebanon and how would you assess Lebanon's potential to become a regional technology hub?</h4><p><span></span>MIEP is a key project in fostering and nurturing young or mature talents in ICT. The ministry also sponsors and financially supports numerous other projects and initiatives, launched by the private sector.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends in the industry are you currently seeing in Lebanon and how does Transmed respond to them to better serve its clients?</h4><p><span></span>Transmed is basically an extension of the partners that we work with, whether it's Procter &amp; Gamble, Mars, Danone, Clorox, Sysco, Mondelez, or any other company or brand. We are the sales and distribution arm of those companies. They are not really present on the ground there, but they support all our marketing and advertising activities to build their brands, while we handle the trade and all key accounts, import the products, and distribute them. In terms of keeping a finger on the pulse of trends, we get firsthand experience with our on-the-ground contact with consumers. Certain trends do stand out; for example, most households that consume the products we distribute are double income households where both the man and woman are in work. That leads to growth in demand for products that are easy to use, easy to handle, and convenient, because those are the kinds of products that people with limited time most appreciate.</p><h4>How do you ensure that each product gets the best promotional exposure from your sales teams?</h4><p><span></span>We make sure not to sell conflicting brands, although some of our principles can have two or three brands—but brands that cater to different markets and consumers. For example, we distribute three kinds of detergent, namely Ariel, Bonux, and Tide. These three brands cater to different consumers. Ariel is the best cleaning detergent on the market, and the most expensive of the three, whereas Bonux is more affordable, with Tide somewhere in between. So they cater to different income groups, but we would never have two brands or two principles that directly compete with each other in the same territory. We make sure we have dedicated focus by principle and by channel. We have one team that covers modern trade (MT), one that covers middle trade, and another that covers the small stores and bakkalas.</p><h4>What type of partnerships are you looking for to strengthen your core distribution business?</h4><p><span></span>We tend to operate alone most of the time in our other markets, relying on our own skill sets. We regularly transfer people between the various markets, and believe that the wide experience this promotes helps us better serve consumers and clients. Having said that, should a partnership opportunity arise somewhere, we would gladly assess it.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in West Africa and what is your growth strategy in the region?</h4><p><span></span>We entered the African market seven or eight years ago, beginning with Sudan. Since establishing ourselves there we have expanded into West Africa, and are on the ground in three regional markets; Ivory Coast, Senegal, and Ghana. We also cover several markets including Togo, Benin, Burkina Faso, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Mali, Gambia, and Cape Verde, and have distribution relationships in all of them, with an export team based in Accra, Ghana. Consumers are all quite similar; everyone washes their hair, brushes their teeth, washes their clothes, and enjoys a biscuit or a chocolate. But you do have to cater to different consumers in terms of affordability; GDP per capita in West Africa is far less than what it is in the Gulf and GCC. In the UAE you have GDP per capital at around $43,000, while in West Africa it's somewhere between $1,500-$2,000. So you can't provide the same detergent, shampoo, or diaper. That is the main challenge we face in West Africa, although we expect to continue expanding there, and are now looking at entering Nigeria. With over 180 million consumers, Nigeria is a tough and large market, demanding serious resources in terms of capital and HR.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> What steps is the ministry taking to improve the sector's competitiveness in the region and worldwide?</h4><p><span></span>The industrial sector faces a serious challenge with the cost of production contingent on the high cost of facilities. The scarcity of land in a small and mountainous country like Lebanon is behind the soaring prices of property. There is simply less space for housing agriculture and tourism. The price of land and energy is high in comparison to other countries in the region, especially the countries that provide energy subsidies. The cost of labor is also high, compared to neighboring Arab countries such as Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. Lebanon is not rich in raw materials or natural resources like petroleum or phosphates. As a result, our industry's competitiveness is limited. After signing two major trade agreements and conventions with Arab countries and the EU, we entered new markets. Despite the resulting improvement in exports, the country still suffers an ongoing deficit in its trade balance, except for trade with Iraq. Lebanon's GDP is around $50 billion. The country's deficit in trade balance reached $17 billion representing a one third of the GDP.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Industry work with the Ministry of Economy and Trade in terms of implementing incentives to improve Lebanon's balance of trade? </h4><p><span></span>Lebanon is a small country, with a high population density of 4.5 million per 10,000 km2. We have a multifaceted economy including banking, insurance, tourism, agriculture, and industry.  The diaspora has always represented a fundamental support to our economy.  Not everyone in Lebanon has the education to work in services or banking; part of the population subsists on agriculture and other industries. Industries and exports are vital to our economy. The limited success in exporting manufactured products to Arab countries is attributed to the region's comparative advantages: subsidies, market protection policies (trade/technical barriers), etc. So many families depend on the industry sector despite its shortcomings. We have to take measures to increase subsidies similar to the ones previously allocated to agriculture and exportation. Energy must be equally subsidized; however, right now it is not possible because of the severe deficit in our budget and the ever-growing national debt. We must work to protect the industry through trade and technical barriers, or direct protection. </p><h4>Which subsectors are you focusing on the most?</h4><p><span></span>Agrifood is an important sector, as is jewelry and fashion. IT is important, and we are becoming known for pharmaceuticals. Our industry is very advanced, but eventually, it boils down to the cost of production. Our knowledge comes from other developed countries and our education level is extremely advanced as well.</p><h4>What is your strategy to attract foreign investors into the industrial sector in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>We are trying to attract foreign investors in IT and industrial technologies. Lebanese people are highly educated, and we have the capacity to finance all kinds of industries in the country, but competitiveness remains an obstacle. Even in technology and IT because they are not trademarks of Lebanon.  We are competing with India and Pakistan that produce at a low cost. Cost and level of life are higher in Lebanon. </p><h4>What can be done in the future to improve and facilitate exports and trade?</h4><p><span></span>We need political decisions to be made in Lebanon. We simply have to adopt policies that allow us to have an equal and fair trade agreement. Measurements must be taken to grant Lebanese exports opportunities similar to the EU. An arbitrary testing on our agricultural products is required before export, rendering trade nearly impossible. </p><h4>What are your greatest aspirations as the Minister of Industry?</h4><p><span></span>My focus is to boost exportation by increasing our trade partners. We need to enhance our participation in exhibitions, to improve the quality of products and training of workers and industrialists. We must diminish the cost of production by reducing taxes, particularly exportation taxes, by 50%. We also must improve research in the industrial sector and create trade regulations to be on the same page with our partners.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Environmental degradation has emerged as one of the key challenges facing Lebanon's economic and social development, costing the country $908.8 million each year. What initiatives aimed at improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of solid waste management is the Ministry of Environment currently undertaking?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Environment is involved in two initiatives. The SWAM project consists of building and operating sorting and composting plants and sanitary landfills in Lebanon. This project will lead to the closure of several open dumps and will stop the open burning activities. The second initiative is the national strategy for solid waste management issued by the Ministry of Environment, which is now in the bidding process and should be implemented starting end of July 2015.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Environment promote recycling and re-usage of materials among the Lebanese population?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Environment promotes recycling through supporting awareness campaigns by participating in workshops, conducting lectures, and approving plans and programs related to sorting at source for NGOs and municipalities</p><h4>Over the past decade, forest fires have been increasingly seen in Mount Lebanon. What steps are being taken to reduce the intensity and frequency?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Environment in collaboration with AFDC (a national NGO) and the concerned ministries developed in 2009 "The National Strategy for Forest Fires Management In Lebanon," which was approved by the Council of Ministers. The strategy covers five axes, including research and analysis, forest protection, forest fires eruption preparedness, combatting forest fire, and rehabilitation. The five axes are the responsibilities and prerogatives of many ministries and institutions. Regarding rehabilitation, the Ministry of Environment has executed a national reforestation program aiming at the rehabilitation and restoration of degraded forest areas in all Lebanese regions. </p><h4>The proportion of forested land in Lebanon was 10% in 2014, a big reduction on 30% forested area 40 years ago. What is the importance of afforestation and reforestation projects in the drive for recreating “Green Lebanon"?</h4><p><span></span>Due to the rapid growth of Lebanon's population, coupled with the development of agriculture and urban construction, as well as improper forest management, the degradation of forest resources in Lebanon has been accelerating. The Lebanese government has increased its focus on forest conservation and restoration of degraded forest ecosystems. A series of measures has been put in place through the National reforestation strategy applied by Ministry of Environment. Afforestation causes fundamental changes in ecosystem structure and functioning, all of which may affect local and national biodiversity. On the other hand, afforestation and reforestation projects are among a suite of approaches available to address the challenge of climate change and the inclusion of land use change.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the transformation of the energy sector in Lebanon and what are the prospects for the future of clean technologies and renewable energy production in the drive for economic growth?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon demonstrates a high-capacity potential, exceeding our electricity demand for years to come, through the deployment of three renewable energy technologies: hydropower, wind power, and solar power. If renewable energy sources are incorporated into Lebanon's energy mix, the overall cost to the economy will be reduced and will consequently boost growth in terms of employment, sustainability, and overall economic health as government funds are reshuffled and reprioritized. That is the essence of the low-emission economy we are working toward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Beirut Life benefit from its relationship with Bank of Beirut?</h4><p><span></span>It has become internationally acknowledged that banks are no longer banks in a sense of offering only banking products but rather financial institutions offering financial services and products. This includes a broad range of banking, insurance, investment, and financial advisory and planning services, with any combination of them. While bankers are professional in banking, underwriters and insurance experts are professional in insurance and financial advisors are professional in planning and investment. When it comes to banking and insurance, these industries are complementary to each other, since bankers are risk averse and insurers are risk takers. Bankers accomplish their analysis of the finances and the current ability of clients to meet their obligations, and transfer all or part of the unforeseen risk to us to study and manage. Therefore, in order to become providers of a complete line of financial products and services, we joined efforts to design the products needed to satisfy our clients' needs, and convert our branches into a one-stop-shopping place for financial products and services. For us, Bank of Beirut comprises a captive client and their customers are our largest target market. Their physical locations and branches are our best channels of distribution. We see synergy as a situation where one plus one equal more than two, and with Bank of Beirut we experience synergy at its best. This is not an edge to our group only, but to our clients as well, who benefit from our lower costs leading to products and services that are fairly priced.</p><h4>What does Beirut Life add to the Lebanese insurance sector as a newly established company?</h4><p><span></span>We believe that competition is the only way towards perfection. We have a vision of becoming providers of specialty life insurance products, thus driving other companies to compete with us to the ultimate benefit of our customers. We aim to enhance the awareness of our market base on the importance of planning and protection against the financial impacts of life's unfortunate events and their resulting trauma. We also aim to tackle our customers' priorities by offering the most appropriate solution. All this will be coupled with the proper education, which will feature and emphasize the qualities of each product, its target and limitations if any. Only then will the client learn how to compare and contrast and choose the best. In addition, our ability to physically reach a wider market through our branches will certainly help the industry gain new insurance loyal clients and contribute positively to the size of the national portfolio. </p><h4>What steps does Beirut Life follow to promote insurance awareness in Lebanon and the region?</h4><p><span></span>Although awareness is not a variable that can be measured in numbers, other indicators may be used to depict its magnitude. Once we realize that an average citizen of Ireland spends 35% of his income on insurance products and that of England spends 25%, while an average Lebanese citizen spends only 1% on insurance, we will simply conclude that awareness among other constraints is inadequate. Moreover, most people fear the unknown, or more specifically, things that they cannot comprehend. In this context, we have to admit that an insurance contract and its fine prints is a document that is hard to grasp and consequently can generate ambiguity. At Beirut Life, one of our objectives is to contribute to the process of building customer awareness and invest to gear up and enhance the image of insurance in Lebanon. To accomplish that, we intend to play three major roles while assuming our duties as insurers. We intend to be educators, distributors, and fair claims payers. Each of these roles will have an obligation towards our customers, which will ultimately lead to more awareness, trust, and confidence.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the current state of the Lebanese electricity system in terms of its sustainability? </h4><p><span></span>Sustainable socio-economic development is a primary objective for the Lebanese government. Ensuring the security and efficiency of supply of energy is vital for the accomplishment of this objective. The fragile political and security status are putting enormous pressure on Lebanon's natural resources as well as on existing infrastructure. Subsidized electricity and water tariffs are imposing an additional burden on the national budget. The Policy Paper of the Electricity Sector includes ten strategic initiatives to develop the sector's infrastructure, balance supply and demand, and enhance the legal and administrative frameworks. </p><p><span></span>The Ministry of Energy and Water is investing all needed efforts to lead in transforming the energy sector towards a robust mix of traditional and renewable energy sources. Lebanon has committed itself to reach 12% of renewable energy by 2020. In addition, the policy emphasized the inclusion and the participation of the private sector in the electricity generation process.</p><h4>For a small country, Lebanon has significant wind resources. How do you assess the opportunities for developing wind farms in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>The national wind atlas of Lebanon shows that we have considerable wind energy resources, with a feasible potential of around 500 MW. The Ministry launched a national process to develop the first wind farm by the private sector back in 2012, and today we are finalizing this process. </p><h4>How does the Lebanese Government support the private sector in preserving country's resources and developing green technologies?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Energy and Water is setting a clear path towards developing green energy technologies in the country. The Ministry is working hard to be a good example for the private sector to follow. The Ministry also invests considerable effort through the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) to improve the quality of companies and services in the sector. </p><h4>What are the main advantages of investing in Lebanon's energy sector and what steps are being taken to attract FDI?</h4><p><span></span>The price, or tariff, at which the energy is being sold, is significantly below its cost. The solution would be to raise the tariff as needed to reach the balance between revenues and costs. The approach that the Ministry is using is to increase the tariff gradually as the hours of electricity supply are increased over time.  The government needs to reach a situation that allows the tariff adjustment in order to reduce the burden of subsidies. The energy sector offers big opportunities for investment, especially since the banking sector in Lebanon is well developed. Lebanon is also aiming to open the door for private sector entities to invest in renewable energy sources like wind and solar.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Lebanon's alternative energy future, as well as for the goal of the renewable energy policy to generate 12% of power from renewable energy sources by 2020?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Energy and Water is keen to develop renewable energy sources as well as energy efficiency measures. Today, the Ministry through the team of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation is evaluating the 2011-15 plan and is now developing the 2016-20 plan towards achieving our national target of 12% renewable energy by 2020. The set targets are challenging, but I am optimistic about the path the country is taking in energy efficiency and renewable energy. </p><h4>Looking to 2016, what are your main goals as the Minister of Energy and Water?</h4><p><span></span>The concerns and goals of any Minister of Energy and Water is to ensure the smooth continuation of projects in the Energy and Water sectors since these projects are long-term government investments. This is particularly important for the energy sector since it is a vital one that can have strategic, economic, and environmental impacts.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In March 2014, the BSE signed an agreement with Euronext for the implementation of a new trading application platform. What is the importance of this new system and how does it contribute to enhancing the credibility of the local financial market?</h4><p><span></span>From a technical perspective, the BSE has always been well structured and our technical infrastructure is being constantly up-dated to match the highest international standards. Currently, the BSE is using the NSC-UNIX trading system, which is developed and used by Euronext. In addition, we adopted an online trading system and developed an up to date website to provide our investors an easy use search engine for market data and listed companies' information. Recently, we signed an agreement with EURONEXT to set up an advanced, state-of-the-art, electronic trading system in the coming two years that will improve the technical performance of the market and support the expected growth in equity listing and the entry into new asset classes in the Lebanese markets.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to promote the financial markets in Lebanon and attract more institutional investors to the BSE?</h4><p><span></span>In an effort to foster the development of the financial markets in Lebanon, the Lebanese Parliament endorsed law #161/2011 in August 2011; I participated in different panel discussions of the law in the parliament, and suggested many amendments to it. The law has been drafted according to recognized international standards, and aims to develop sound and transparent financial markets in Lebanon. It is expected to boost the activity of the Lebanese financial markets, increase its transparency, its liquidity, as well as its efficiency. The new law governs all operations related to the issuing, purchase, sale, or promotion of financial instruments that are directly offered to public subscription and that are listed or traded on the stock exchanges. The market authority will be entrusted to issue rules in relation to the operation of financial markets, to regulate the IPO process and the listing of financial products, as well as to look into ownership issues where listed companies are involved. Moreover, it has power to award licenses and authorizations, particularly to financial rating agencies, collective investment schemes, financial intermediation companies, stock exchanges, and companies that offer consultancy and other services relating to financial products to the general public. It monitors financial markets, conducts investigations, issues sanctions, and prompts criminal proceedings where necessary. It also identifies the publications, disclosures, and information to be provided by the listed companies to the investors. In addition, the new law provides for the establishment of the Financial Market Court to which the Chairman and members must devote their time. Finally, the new Financial Market Law takes into consideration the privatization of the BSE by turning it into a Lebanese joint stock company in the first stage, to be established in Beirut and dominated “Beirut Stock Exchange SAL," and in a later stage assigning its shares to third parties from the private sector, through a public or private offering, pursuant to a decision of the Council of Ministers</p><h4>Most Lebanese businesses, industries, and services are family owned. How does the BSE work to educate entrepreneurs on the importance of disclosing their activities and raising capital through the stock exchange?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanese businesses, both in the commercial and service sectors, are, in the vast majority, small family-owned firms that prefer to finance their activities through bank credit in order to keep control over their companies. However, the BSE Committee is trying to correct the current situation by giving increasing attention to educational and promotional programs that aim to attract and convince medium-sized Lebanese companies to list their shares on the BSE and to increase their capital through the broadening of the shareholder base, by highlighting the importance and advantages of financing through the stock exchange.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges and respective opportunities facing the CMA and what are the key steps that CMA has undertaken towards effectively implementing its mandate?</h4><p><span></span>The CMA was established two and a half  years ago. Law 161, which governs capital markets was passed in 2011, and the government appointed the Board of Directors in Mid-2012. Before the establishment of the CMA, a dedicated capital markets regulator did not exist in Lebanon. The stock exchange was a self-regulatory organization, and Banque du Liban (BDL) as the overseer of the capital markets had limited scope through one of it's departments; the Financial Markets Department. Law 161 is important because it is one of the most complete in the region, and has divided capital markets into three main pillars: The CMA Board, the Sanctioning Committee, and the Tribunal. Those are the governing pillars of capital markets in Lebanon and they are independent from each other, and as such, the structure of the law insured a major advantage in favor of more transparency in the market. The Board of Directors of the CMA issues regulations, develops, oversees and supervises the market, whereas the Sanctioning Committee is responsible for sanctioning any foul play and determines where fines should be applied. As CMA Board, we cannot apply any fines, only the Sanctioning Committee does. However, it is in our legal capacity to penalize participants by revoking licenses, or demand partial or complete stoppage of activities by any participant when deemed necessary. Also, the Capital Markets Law has established an independent tribunal, the first of its kind in Lebanon, specific to and specializing in capital markets. This tribunal is also governed by an independent board, and by law, the tribunal should deal with any case that is presented to it by a maximum period of six months. Such a legal condition carries great significance; it ensures efficacy and efficiency in market activities, while also increasing the confidence of investors in the local market. Should any problem arise with any institution or any capital market issue, they can go straight to the Tribunal and know that within six months they will have a verdict. Those who do business in Lebanon shall attest to how revolutionary such a tribunal is. The stock exchange is a government institution, and this affects its performance. The law stipulates that the government should transfer the Beirut Stock Exchange from an existing government institution into a joint stock company within a year, and then a year later they will have to privatize it. This should be the first thing on the cabinet's agenda. Ideally, we would like to see the Beirut Stock Exchange carry the flag and be the only exchange in the market—having its primary platform, its alternative investment platform, and commodities platform. </p><h4>What role does the CMA play in encouraging and enforcing the culture of good corporate governance?</h4><p><span></span>We actually transferred the existing regulations from the Central Bank to the CMA, and within six months we rewrote all the existing regulations together with the World Bank taking into consideration IOSCO standards and best business practices. When the internal work was complete, we took those regulations and went to the market, invited everybody, had a town hall meeting, and discussed the regulations in details with the market. Not only was the market ready, but the way we saw it is that they were eager for a regulator that understands how things should move forward, and they are changing the way they do business today. We are greatly encouraged about how the market is proceeding and are embracing these changes.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What needs to be done to enhance the regulatory environment in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>The regulatory framework is obsolete and is not doing the industry or the economy any favors. The law was issued in the sixties. There was some adaptation throughout the years, but nothing much. However, what we have seen is that the regulator has tried to adapt and has tried to use whatever rules and whatever rights he has to enforce certain changes, certain requirements, to try to improve the market condition, financial stability and the financial condition of the insurance companies. This is very challenging. When the Syrian market was opened to the private sector, the average capitalization required for insurance companies was $17 million, compared to Lebanon's current $2 million. Minimum capitalization in Saudi Arabia is in excess of $25 million, in the UAE minimum capitalization is also in excess of $20-22 million, and they aim to increase it. This small capital requirement in Lebanon is the tip of the iceberg. We have so many other requirements that are not adapted. For a Lebanese market that is $1.5 billion in terms of premium income, one of the highest expenditures per capita and one of the highest penetration ratios of the GDP, which is one of the highest in the region. The Lebanese market and Lebanese companies are more or less self-regulated and they are doing an extremely good job without proper regulation. To be so advanced in terms of marketing, distribution, sales, and product development while there are no proper rules and regulation is testament to the capability of the Lebanese insurance industry to be entrepreneurial, resilient, and strong.</p><h4>Do you foresee any relevant changes in the regulatory framework in the coming months?</h4><p><span></span>Unfortunately, the insurance industry hasn't been on the agenda for any government in Lebanon in the last ten or 15 years. The insurance industry insures and provides risk management solutions, continuity, and peace of mind for investors and families. It also enhances risk assessment and risk treatment. When you look at the duration of the liabilities that insurance companies have, it can be multiple years and it can be very long term. Therefore, the insurance industry has the capability of investing on the long term. It is an important investment tool that even the banks do not have because the investments of banks are short term and the assets have to match the duration of the liabilities. The Lebanese economy is not using this because the laws are outdated. </p><h4>What is the importance of networking events such as General Arab Insurance Federation (GAIF) conference for Chedid?</h4><p><span></span>GAIF is a major event for our industry. It rotates, last year it was in Sharm el Sheik in Egypt, prior to that it was in Morocco. In 2016 it will take place in Lebanon. Last time it was in Lebanon was in 2004. The event gathers all the insurance companies from the MENA region. It is also an attractive venue for international players that want to understand the market, the region, the threats and opportunities. For us it is a major event because we see all of our clients in the space of four or five days. There are in excess of 400 insurance companies in the Middle East region. If each company sends two or three attendees, plus the international insurers, you will have a gathering of around 2,000 individuals. It is a very interesting event but at the same time very challenging from a logistics and networking point of view.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What factors lie behind BLOM's success and what have been the major milestones for the bank over 2014?</h4><p><span></span>Between 2007 and 2014, assets grew at a CAGR of 7.8% to reach $27.98 billion, and lending grew at 14.6% to reach $6.91 billion. We have also been remarkably profitable—profits grew during the same period at 8.4% to settle at $365.38 million; in addition, we have maintained a high ROAE, which stood at 15.8% at the end of 2014. It is noteworthy that this was all accomplished during the global financial crisis, the Arab Spring, and the ongoing instability in Lebanon. </p><p><span></span>One of the main accomplishments in 2014 was our investment in the three “knowledge economy" funds—Impact, Leap Investment I, and Berytech II—as part of Banque du Liban's (BdL) directive 331. We also established a joint credit card with Beirut Traders' Association (BTA) for small- and medium-sized traders, reaching more than 700 members so far in the prime shopping malls and zones of the country. Lastly, entry into the promising Iraqi market by opening a branch each in Baghdad and Erbil was a big achievement for us last year. </p><h4>What steps is BLOM Bank taking to maintain its market share, and how does this strategy differ between markets?</h4><p><span></span>We are constantly working on not just maintaining our market share but increasing it. We are the leading bank in Lebanon for retail lending—our retail lending increased between 2007 and 2014 at a CAGR of 24.9% to reach $2.7 billion—and we are at the forefront of introducing new products and services. In Jordan, we run a very successful retail operation, enjoying the highest growth rate in the banking sector there. In Egypt, we have solid business in retail, corporate, trade financing, and asset management; and we have just established a company to run our expanding Egyptian asset management services. In Saudi, our investment banking operation is very dynamic, and we have currently the fastest growing business in real estate funds. In the UAE, our trade finance and corporate activities are doing well and expanding, and in Qatar and Europe, we are working diligently to enhance our corporate and private banking operations. </p><h4>What role does technology play at BLOM Bank and what innovative solutions have been recently implemented?</h4><p><span></span>Technology gives banks a competitive edge in delivering accessible and up-to-date products. We have the unique e-Cash service that allows our customers to send money from anywhere in the world to individuals who can cash it at our ATM machines and do not have to be our clients. Our POS machines are also able to converting payments into the currency of their choice. All our tech-based services are highly secured and come with the utmost protection.</p><h4>What are BLOM Bank's future investment plans?</h4><p><span></span>BLOM's short- and long-term investment plans are always designed to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and the sustainability of our profits. Our major investments are: cash and central bank 36.9%; loans 25.3%; securities 25.1%; and interbank 10.1%. BLOM participated in BdL's directive 331 initiative, investing $30 million in start-up funds to help shore up the “knowledge economy" sector in the country.</p><h4>How has Islamic banking evolved in Lebanon over the past years and what was BLOM Development Bank's role in its development?</h4><p><span></span>Islamic banking remains a niche market in Lebanon mainly due to the predominance of conventional banking and the cultural and religious diversity of the country. BLOM Development Bank (BDB) has done fairly well in this limited market, experiencing double-digit growth rates in the past few years. BDB was the first Islamic bank in Lebanon to undertake sharia-compliant short- and long-term placements with BdL. It has launched debit cards and e-banking services, and was selected by The Banker as the “Best Islamic Bank in Lebanon for 2013." </p><h4>What is your assessment of Beirut's potential to regain the role of a major banking center in the region?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon successfully played that role until the 1975 civil war, and the frequent skirmishes that followed since its culmination in 1990 have further weakened the position, especially considering the emergence of markets in Dubai and Bahrain. Lebanon could now develop as a center for the Arab Eastern Mediterranean region and Lebanese banks would play an increasingly influential role in the region as a whole.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malia Group is a diversified group of companies with activities spanned across several sectors. What strategies do you follow in order to create synergies within the group, while at the same time, enhancing partnerships with other players in the market?</h4><p><span></span>Malia Group is currently going through a period of transition and restructuring. In 2016 my responsibilities will move away from being both CEO and Chairman and will focus on the Chairmanship of the Group. The restructuring on the corporate level will include two CEOs—one for Malia Holding and one for Malia Invest. Furthermore, the restructuring includes the appointment of a corporate secretary who will ensure that corporate governance is being implemented now that we have the financial systems in place. As a result of our adoption of corporate governance that we did in consultation with IFC, we have established committees that also include external stakeholders and advisors. We will also be recruiting a chief financial officer in the near future. Moreover, we believe that restructuring in such a way sends a positive message to all our stakeholders that will guarantee that Malia Group will continue to grow and expand. Furthermore, the restructuring includes a new strategy based on full transparency, and we are planning to go for an IPO in the near future and depending the region and international factors. </p><h4>Looking forward to Malia Group's regional and international midterm future, from where do you anticipate the core revenue streams to originate?</h4><p><span></span>We believe in investing during times of uncertainty and that opportunities present themselves when uncertainty is peaking. We act as pioneers in different market and are present where other do not have the vision to be yet. But it's important to properly assess the risks and react to uncertainty in a well-studied manner with a long-term strategy, because we believe that we should smartly invest where there are real and present opportunities. </p><h4>What is your main focus as well as expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>We have a three-year plan that essentially includes investment in Lebanon in our pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, Pharmaline, whereby we will be working on the third extension of the plant. Since we are partners and representative of Honeywell, which is one of the biggest technology suppliers of mobile solutions, we are now expanding our cooperation for different markets. We are looking to do the same in some African countries.  Also, on the regional level, which for us is the Gulf market, we are developing Pharmaline Saudi Arabia. As for Iraq, we have three exciting new projects under construction. Our aim is to renew the growth of investment over the coming years. We always want to invest despite the uncertainty of the region. We must reengineer the way of doing business to give more security for the future and sustain the growth at the same time. </p><h4>Malia Group has been involved in the industrial production of personal care for 60 years. What challenges and respective opportunities have you encountered while building an enterprise in the Lebanese market?</h4><p><span></span>In the personal care business, the challenge today is to develop new formulations and new products, and to perform in a way that the market can absorb them. In the coming weeks, we will launch a new hair dye for a younger generation which has an easy-to-use concept. We are continuously reformulating our shampoo formulas and our styling gels according to generational trends. This is what basically makes us successful both locally and regionally. Now we are moving outside the region. We are looking to export Cosmaline, our in-house personal care brand, in Africa. We have to focus on an African range of products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the latest developments concerning privatization in Lebanon, and what initiatives are the Higher Council for Privatization (HCP) currently working on?</h4><p><span></span>The only sector that could benefit from privatization in Lebanon today is, in my judgment, the telecoms sector.  Unfortunately, there has not been much progress on that front to-date. The current Minister of Telecommunications has expressed willingness to apply the Telecoms Law and so create an integrated operator, to be called Liban Telecom. We are now waiting for that process to start. On the public-private partnerships (PPPs) front, we are still awaiting the enactment of legislation and have issued a book of guidelines for the tendering of PPP projects in Lebanon. But even though we do not have PPP legislation that mandates international best practice as yet, there is PPP activity going on. Parliament has passed legislation in 2014 to allow the Council of Ministers to license PPP power plants, usually referred to as Independent Power Producers (IPPs). We are waiting for the Ministry of Energy to take the necessary steps to start that process. </p><h4>What is the importance of PPPs for the sustainable development of Lebanon's economy?</h4><p><span></span>The importance of PPPs to the economy is tremendous. I personally think that it is the only thing that will make a difference in improving our economy at this point. We are in desperate need of infrastructure and PPPs are exactly designed to finance infrastructure. We need roads, bridges, towers, and telecom infrastructure. We need power plants and dams. We need prisons and public transport. We now have bank assets in Lebanon of about $190 billion of which about $160 billion are deposits. This is a huge monetary mass for a country the size of Lebanon where the GDP is $47 billion. As a result, banks are interested in funding PPP projects; they see it as an alternative to simply continuing to finance the Government on an unsecured, non-recourse basis. We have Lebanese entrepreneurs who have been very active for the past 15 years creating and undertaking PPP projects in the Gulf, Saudi Arabia, and various regions in Africa. We have the need, we have the financing, and we have the entrepreneurs to do it. There are also now 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon. This situation has led the lowest cost of manual labor in relative terms in the history of Lebanon. We should take advantage of that fact. It creates a win-win situation, where they help us build our infrastructure and we organize their presence in the country. Furthermore, today our economy is based on enterprises that are often family owned, and individual enterprises do not create employment. In order to create jobs in large numbers, you need large projects like infrastructure development. These projects will not only be employing manual laborers but also local architects, engineers, managers, accountants, lawyers, IT people, and admin people. Creating jobs is the main priority for our economy. Not only to create better living standards, but also to stem the tide of emigration. Through emigration we lose our best and brightest, and this has been happening for the past 30 years.</p><h4>Are public authorities doing enough in terms of improving the framework for investors and promoting the country?</h4><p><span></span>Public authorities need to primarily focus on job creation, which has not been the case because they have been sidetracked in other directions. One of the most important factors in job creation, beside stability and economic growth, is having an investor-friendly environment.  In Lebanon, we still have work to do in this regard and the public authorities definitely need to give it more attention.  Red tape and complicated and unnecessary procedures are among the elements that still hinder simple matters such as the creation of new companies and the dissolution of old ones.  A series of reforms has been identified, which require changes to legislation and are being sent to Parliament for action.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Lebanon's Prime Minister, what are your administrative and legislative goals for improving the ease of doing business in Lebanon?</h4><p><span></span>Our services have been working in the framework of a project supported by the IFC to simplify administrative procedures related to the constitution of the various types of companies, or their liquidation. The same project addresses reforms in the areas of commercial registry, types of assets placed, and collateral and bankruptcy procedures. All this is meant to improve the business climate while safeguarding rigor and transparency. The resulting policy recommendations will soon be translated into new laws and executive decrees.</p><h4>What sectors are the most promising for attracting foreign investment over the medium term, and what are you expecting for 2015 in terms of inflows?</h4><p><span></span>We believe that energy, real estate, and tourism constitute attractive opportunities. The law on PPPs will be promulgated as soon as the political environment permits, which will provide an effective conduit for investments in all these areas. In addition, the launching of the activities of the Capital Markets Authority will no doubt boost the Beirut Stock Exchange and facilitate the movement of capital for investors and for the domestic market by affording flexible access to both equity and debt. Traditionally, Lebanon has a positive balance of payments due to a steady flow of remittances estimated at around $7 billion. Noticeably, bank deposits have increased by close to 3% at mid-year, despite regional and local political uncertainties; this is a clear sign of sustained confidence in the stability of the country and of the continued attractiveness of the banking sector.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to reduce the country's public debt?</h4><p><span></span>Public deficit has decreased this year as a result of a slowing in expenditures and a slightly improved tax inflow. However, the durable solution is in achieving high growth levels because it automatically improves fiscal revenues without introducing additional taxes. Mathematically, a higher GDP will also cause a fall in the ratio of debt to GDP and bring us closer to internationally acceptable levels. It is important to note, however, that economic activity, though insufficient by our standards, remains at satisfactory levels when compared to countries of the region and beyond. This represents an achievement in a country witnessing the political difficulties Lebanon is going through; a country that, in addition, has seen, in less than two years, a massive inflow of foreigners who now constitute one-third of its national population. This is a proof of the high resilience of the private sector and a demonstration that the uniqueness of the Lebanese model of democracy, tolerance, liberalism, openness, and coexistence is, and will continue to be a powerful attraction for investments and business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to Fadi Saab, Chairman of the Lebanese Society for Quality, the annual cost of corruption in Lebanon amounts to $6 billion, equivalent to 12% of country's GDP—how is the World Bank supporting anti-corruption initiatives?</h4><p><span></span>Generally speaking, Governance and transparency to serve secured and faithful transactions are the main underpinning of the World Bank Group's engagements worldwide. Safeguards and rules are devised by the management of the World Bank and approved by its Board of Directors. Each of the countries in which we operate is represented on that board, meaning each rule and regulation is owned by the countries where we operate. Therefore, we are not imposing rules on member countries, but rather implementing  rules, regulations, and guidelines that have already been approved by representatives of the 188 member countries. Through our operations and financing, we aim to build the capacity of the government agencies with which we work, and to do so by instilling transparency and predictability in our procedures and processes. Subsequently, those agencies are exposed to the makings of good governance. Our main thrust is to build long-term capacity of local institutions. We need to provide institutions with a sound basis for their business. This is important, because when foreign and local investors weigh the risks of investing in a certain country, they need to be confident of predictability, transparency and accountability at all levels. The Lebanese Minister of Finance has lately taken a strong public stance on corruption. He has mentioned in no uncertain terms that  the system as it is functioning today is inefficient, and works to the detriment of the Lebanese people and Lebanese institutions. He stated that the presidential vacuum is taking a toll on all institutions, and that consequently Parliament was rendered ineffective and unable to perform its basic legislative duties. He is looking aggressively at addressing the corrupt practices that seem to be plaguing the system, and he cited the energy sector for instance as one of those areas where more needs to be done. </p><h4>The World Bank recently granted Lebanon a $474 million loan for the construction of the Bisri Dam aimed at improving water supplies in the country. What is the significance of this project?</h4><p><span></span>This is the largest project that the Bank has ever financed in Lebanon. When this project is finished, it will give potable water to 1.6 million people in Greater Beirut and Mount Lebanon. These citizens represent 45% of the Lebanese population. This will make a major difference in the way Lebanon manages its water potential. This is a country that is extremely blessed with water resources and should not be experiencing supply shortages.  However, till now, its water resources have not been properly governed. In an ideal world, Lebanon should be able to export water to neighboring countries. The new project will have transformational outcomes, by establishing new, comprehensive systems for water treatment, distribution and management. It is part and of a package of projects in Lebanon that the Bank has been financing for a few years. It is a huge infrastructure undertaking, which will take six or seven years to be complete, and another year or two for it to be operational.</p><h4>What can be done to better integrate the Syrian refugees into the Lebanese society?</h4><p><span></span>We need to keep pushing for lateral and bilateral donor financing. Donor countries, regional and international financial institutions need to see the situation for what it is, and engage with Lebanon.  The fact is that whatever money, infrastructure and natural resources Lebanon has are inadequate to cater for 5.5 million people on its soil.  Lebanon has been providing the world with a global public good by opening its borders. Imagine if Lebanon had closed its borders, how much different the situation would have been for those people. Lebanon is sparing the refugees a tragic fate, and also easing the pressures more affluent countries would have had to shoulder. Lebanon cannot continue to pay for the good it is providing.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In March 2015, the Prime Minister sponsored the launch of the roadmap for the national strategy of sustainable development, which aims to support economic, social, and administrative reform. What is the role of the Ministry for Administrative Reform in this strategy?</h4><p>Our ministry is effective because it works with the World Bank, the EU, and some Arab funds that are granted as gifts for the Ministry of Administrative Reform. That said, we have a lot to do, especially in the area of e-government. E-government is about easing the life of our citizens; however, it is difficult to do in Lebanon as almost everything is politicized. Every decision made has to be accepted by every party, meaning everything takes a lot of time. My vision is to have a kind of public-private partnership (PPP), especially for the development of the e-government. All the Gulf countries are advanced in e-government, and many of them are managed by Lebanese companies, not local ones. These people naturally want to offer the same services to their home country, Lebanon. The idea of e-government started a long time ago, before I was a minister. I have an e-government unit here in the ministry. My vision is different; I want to outsource all the services while the e-government unit coordinates and leads the project. I want to divide the whole e-government process between different sectors for taxes, e-payment, general security, and e-learning for the public sector, for example. I want these private companies to come and undertake each sector, all coordinated and led by our e-government unit. We have already started creating some services, such as the general security section that covers passport services, and we are starting new services with the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture regarding permits; however, it is still weak.</p><h4>What is Ministry's position regarding the public sector wage funding?</h4><p><span></span>When you don't pay money from your pocket, it is easy to tell people you are going to give them such and such amount of money or pay increases, for example. Therefore, when you have a new law concerning salaries and decreasing taxes, it is important that if you are going to increase salaries in the public sector, you also have to state within the same law where that money is going to come from. If tax decreases are proposed, it also must be stipulated what will make up for that tax decrease. Decreasing taxes will naturally have an effect on wages as well. Increasing wages in such an environment is counterintuitive. If you increase wages for public servants, the army will demand a wage increase, and so will the public teachers, and so on. They all deserve it too. But if you want a well-functioning government you need well-paid public servants; hence, I'm now trying to convince the government and the parliament that we have to do that. </p><h4>Looking forward to 2016, what are your biggest aspirations as the Minister of State for Administrative Reform?</h4><p><span></span>My biggest aspiration is to launch our outsourcing of the e-government to attract investors, so procedures for official paperwork and formalities are accessible online, without having to leave their homes or offices. When you have a political crisis in a country, that's where you need to invest. That's why people need to invest in Lebanon. <span></span></p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the role of women entrepreneurs in the region, and how does Lebanon stand in comparison to other countries in the region in that regard?</h4><p><span></span>The Arab world has witnessed significant changes in regard to women's empowerment and gender equality over the past 20 years. Gender parity in primary and secondary education has been nearly realized and more women than men enroll in tertiary education in most countries. Women have seen improvements in health, including access to reproductive health services, and various national systems have made advancements in terms of guaranteeing women's rights at the legal and political level. Despite this progress, the region as a whole has yet to see a significant change in women's economic participation. Most notably, and despite impressive rates in female higher education, the region has some of the lowest representation of women in the workforce. Women in Lebanon face many of the same challenges as they do in other countries in the region. In 2010, Lebanon ranked 88 out of 113 economies in The Economist's “Women's Economic Opportunity Index," which measures specific attributes of the environment for female employees and entrepreneurs. And according to available figures, Lebanese women make up only 22% of the labor force, and 10.7% of senior staff and managers. Moreover, the share of Lebanese women in the MSME sector is quite low with figures ranging between 8% and 10% as per UNDP (2008) and ILO (2007), despite the fact that the legal system does not impose any gender-based restrictions on setting up businesses, acquiring bank loans, or owning property. Recent years, however, have seen positive developments in supporting the potential of women entrepreneurs in Lebanon. In 2005, various legal and administrative measures were undertaken in support of women entrepreneurs, for example the Labor Code was amended to allow women to work at night, tax laws were revised to ensure gender parity on tax reduction. Various programs, mostly led by international organizations and private banks, were also developed to support the competitiveness of entrepreneurial initiatives and the MSME sector, including female-owned businesses. Yet, many of these lack a gender dimension and a clear understanding of the specific needs of women entrepreneurs, particularly those operating at a small or medium scale. Given the nature of the Lebanese economy, dominated by the private sector with heavy concentration in small enterprises, the country stands to benefit significantly from supporting the prospects of, and increasing opportunities for women entrepreneurs. </p><h4>What opportunities does the concept of Arab integration offer, and what political, economic, social and cultural developments are needed to achieve the economic prosperity in the region?</h4><p><span></span>For the Arab world to experience improved economic prosperity and human development for all, issues across the region need to be addressed. Only addressing narrow targets for economic growth (i.e. trade) fails to address broader dimensions of the real economy, such as education, standards of living, and welfare. Therefore, in the “Arab Integration: A 21st Century Development Imperative" report, comprehensive reform is put forward as a main goal for the Arab region. </p><h4>What is the main focus of UN-ESCWA for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>ESCWA is working strategically with its Member States in helping them bringing the issues of the region to inform the global discourse on development agendas, including the preparation for the negotiation process towards developing a regional perspective on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); financing for development in the context of means of implementation of the SDGs;and the climate change negotiation process. UN-ESCWA is also analyzing and rethinking the current Arab development model taking into account the challenges from socio-economic and environmental aspects, including the consequences of conflicts and crises. A forthcoming report on Vision 2030 aims to advocate Member States toward realigning their policies and programs in a way that keeps people at the center of development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

Lebanese migrants have enriched Australia's society with their enterprise, civic spirit, and vibrant culture. Today, Lebanon faces grave challenges, as it hosts an enormous population of refugees and is faced with rising extremism in the region. I welcome the generosity and fortitude demonstrated by the Lebanese people at this time. Australia stands by Lebanon and is a committed supporter of its sovereignty and prosperity. Countering the threat of terrorist groups such as ISIL is a priority for countries around the world, including both Australia and Lebanon. Our main areas of cooperation with Lebanon currently include defense, law enforcement, and counter-terrorism. Australia and Lebanon are both members of the international anti-Da'esh coalition. Australia offers a number of places on Australia-based joint training courses to selected members of the Lebanese Armed Forces. Australia has also participated in the UN Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) since 1956, in Israel, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. The Council of Australian-Arab Relations has supported cultural exchanges between Australia and Lebanon. In 2014, the Council supported the Adelaide Festival to feature the work of Beirut-based artists and filmmakers Joana Hadjithomas and Khalil Joreige. Our relationship with Lebanon is strong; however, I believe there is scope to do more, including boosting trade and investment. A number of Australian companies are considering the potential of investing in Lebanon's oil and gas sector.</p><h4>What were the main highlights of your visit to Lebanon last year?</h4><p><span></span>I visited Lebanon as Australia's Foreign Minister in April 2014. During my visit, I had a productive discussion with HE Gebran Bassil, Lebanon's Minister for Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, on the strategic challenges we face in the Middle East. I highlighted Australia's strong and continuing support for Lebanon as it addresses the challenges caused by the continuing humanitarian crisis in Syria. The conflicts in the Middle East today are the worst we have seen in many years, and during my visit I had the opportunity to see firsthand the effect on Lebanon. I met with asylum seekers, UNHCR and UNICEF representatives at a processing camp to discuss Australian support for those affected by the Syrian crisis. At the time, I also welcomed the formation of a Lebanese government, which was a crucial step for stability. Lebanon needs strong and united leadership and Australia encourages Lebanon's politicians to work together towards this end.</p><h4>What support has Australia provided to help combat the Syria crisis?</h4><p><span></span>The conflict in Syria is the largest humanitarian, peace, and security crisis facing the world today. Syria urgently needs a political solution to the conflict that can end the violence. Australia will continue to urge all parties to agree on an inclusive process, as outlined in the Geneva Communiqué, which allows the Syrian people to determine their country's future. Australia's response to the Syria crisis is one of our largest to a humanitarian emergency. Since 2011, the Australian Government has provided $155.8 million in humanitarian assistance to help vulnerable people in Syria and its neighboring countries. More than half has been allocated to the regional response to assist Syrian refugees and their host communities, including $30.6 million earmarked specifically for Lebanon. Our assistance has delivered food, water, shelter, protection, health services, and education to communities in need. Australia recently announced a further $20 million in humanitarian assistance at the third international pledging conference for Syria hosted by the UN and the government of Kuwait. This includes support for the World Food Programme and the International Committee of the Red Cross in Syria, as well as UNHCR and Australian non-government organizations in Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What trends do you identify in US-Lebanese trade activities?</h4><p><span></span>Consuming America is always a trend, everywhere in the world really. While nothing dramatic has changed, the exchange rate between euro and the dollar has had an impact. The dollar was becoming very strong versus the euro. This will automatically encourage certain fields of imports from Europe versus the US. Nevertheless, we have a dollarized economy in Lebanon, so we are very comfortable about this level of exchange.</p><h4>What trends have you witnessed in terms of companies applying for membership in the last years?</h4><p><span></span>We have always kept a steady number of companies who are joining the chamber. Most of them are the major corporations operating in Lebanon, either Lebanese or American companies. In fact, there hasn't been much change in the structure of our membership in the chamber. </p><h4>What is your outlook for US-Lebanese trade levels in the medium term?</h4><p><span></span>The outlook is good. In fact, I recently came back from the US where Amcham and Startup Megaphone held the first Start Up Lebanon conference in NYC. This is the future of the economy, especially in countries like Lebanon. Definitely any development of this sector would be towards the United States because this is the biggest market in the world for start-ups. We had a very interesting and successful trip there. We took approximately 40 start-ups from Lebanon, introduced them to major players in the US, and it was impressive to see the level of interest in Lebanon. We had around 250 people the whole day during the conference. All start-ups had the chance to meet with major investors, funds, and VC's. We are optimistic about the next period. </p><h4>What is your assessment of the overall business environment in Lebanon and where in particular can new reforms be implemented in order to facilitate country's further economic growth?</h4><p><span></span>The competition is the strongest from the Gulf region.  Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar are developing so quickly and unfortunately the political problems in Lebanon affect our ability to compete with these markets. But, at the same time the business environment in Lebanon is not only about investing in the infrastructure and telecommunication sectors, it is also about the Lebanese way of life. To be in Lebanon, you need good internet connection and ICT, which are now available. We had some hiccups over the years but we are now in a steady period. The only challenge we still have is to attract more international companies so that the investor in Lebanon will be better exposed to the global market—this is a major advantage the Gulf states have over us. In terms of reforms, there is a lot to do. The major things we should focus on is the public sector; refurbishing the infrastructure, developing the ICT sector, pushing for privatization, investing in the facilities that would attract investors, and building new airports. The capital market is also important because to invest in a company you need an exit strategy and you can't have an exit strategy if you don't have a capital market. Laws have to be changed or amended concerning investments and exit strategies in Lebanon, and intellectual property protection laws, in particular, need tougher enforcement. </p><h4>What sectors of the Lebanese economy are in the highest need for FDI and what are Lebanon's advantages as an investment destination?</h4><p><span></span>Energy is important for Lebanon because it is a way out from the burden of debt. Unfortunately, I don't see it growing in the near future. The next thing that should be done besides developing the ICT sector is investing in the Lebanese people through the educational system—not only the private education system. The public education system was very good before 1975, now it is almost non-existent. A good public educational system will enable the Lebanese people to have the chance to be a part of the country's development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the strength of Lebanon's financial system, in terms of managing the deficit?</h4><p><span></span>Setting a limit for the deficit in the short and medium terms is one of our primary objectives at the Ministry of Finance, since it provides guidelines for our capacity to spend and ensures a sustainable debt path. The ratio of outstanding public debt to GDP in Lebanon is among the highest in the world. As of end December 2013, total public sector debt was 138% of GDP. While the ratio has come down from its peak of 180% in 2006, this ratio has increased most recently from 132% at the end of 2012 to 138% at the end of 2013. The main objective of public debt management is to ensure that the government's financing needs and its payment obligations are met at all times, at the lowest possible cost over the medium to long term and consistent with a prudent, acceptable degree of risk. As public debt management is highly interdependent with monetary policy, the essential coordination is institutionalized in the High Debt Committee. On the other hand, the solid financial and banking systems play an important role in financing the deficit in both local and foreign currencies.</p><h4>Regarding the Ministry's efforts to improve the debt-to-GDP ratio, what is the importance of improving the efficiency on the revenue collection side?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Finance has undertaken extensive measures to improve collection in several areas, primarily in income taxes, VAT, and property taxes, and to increase the tax compliance.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to ensure equitable economic growth throughout the country and what role does the Ministry of Finance play in enhancing financial inclusion?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Finance ensures that capital spending is disbursed in a balanced manner throughout the country and through several sectors. In addition, the Ministry contributes to enhancing the credit growth through the interest subsidy.</p><h4>With a large diaspora, Lebanon has relatively stable remittances inflows. What is the importance of this for the banking sector?</h4><p><span></span>The remittances inflows have a substantial role in providing a resource base for the Lebanese banking system, as well as in providing it with foreign currency—one of the prime sources of accumulating reserves in the Central Bank, which supports Lebanon's policy of stabilizing the exchange rate.</p><h4>What strategy does the Ministry of Finance follow to promote investment, and where are the most fruitful opportunities at the moment?</h4><p><span></span>Lebanon has several investment opportunities, primarily in midsized manufacturing and services, and in technology services. The Ministry of Finance promotes investment by improving the infrastructure and supporting these sectors, as well as through the provision of exemptions allocated to some newly established industries</p><h4>What is your outlook for Lebanon's economic performance in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry of Finance expects the economy to maintain a low rate of inflation, and a stable growth rate in the range if 2.5%. We predict most activities to maintain their pace of performance with the exception of the tourist sector, which has been suffering due to the difficult regional situation. The banking system is expected to continue attracting inflows that support overall financial stability of Lebanon's economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Lebanese banks are known for providing a vital anchor of stability for the national economy despite regional challenges. What factors have created this resilience?
</h4><p>
	The stability of Lebanese banks is related mainly to the monetary policy implemented by the authorities in Lebanon, which helps to ensure the stability of the currency exchange rate, and provides a good environment for banking and financial stability. Lebanese banking stability is also affected by the implementation of international standards—it is an important issue for us in Lebanon to implement international norms. We are implementing all standards related to the financial field, particularly accounting and disclosure standards. We are in more than 30 countries and around 100 cities worldwide, and you cannot have a different set of standards for every country. That is the second importance of adopting and implementing international standards, enabling you to operate in Jordan, Egypt, or Paris. Diversifying and investing outside of Lebanon is a good management tool for us.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>The Lebanese banking sector has always been a pioneer in implementing international norms, such as Basel. What is the significance of keeping ahead, in terms of reinforcing the image and increasing confidence?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Promoting the Lebanese banking sector is very important in order to have a robust industry. The reason so many countries want to deposit and save with Lebanese banking is because it is solid and robust in implementing international standards. The main factor behind the Lebanese banking sector expansion over the last 20 years has been the implementation of sound banking. We have been tested many times during the last 20 years, yet we survived several severe crises nationally, regionally, and globally.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What are the other advantages of investing in Lebanon, and what would be your message to international investors seeking opportunities in the region?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Unfortunately, during the last two or three years we have seen the FDI in Lebanon decline more than 30% compared to the 2010 figure. It was not attractive for investments; and this also impacted investment in Lebanon. The entire region is changing, but our banks continue to attract foreign investors for many reasons; the main Lebanese banks are listed, and they are publishing and disclosing their results every semester. The other reason is that we have been dealing with certain countries in our region where we have had a solid clientí¨le base for more than five decades. The investors in these countries are very pleased with our professionalism and our prudent management and finally with our transparency, and they trust us and like to invest in our banks
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What is your assessment of Beirut's potential to regain the role of a major banking center in the region?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>Throughout the last 30 or 40 years, the banking centers emerged in Arab countries like Bahrain, the UAE, and Qatar. Also, they developed in Jordan, Cairo, Morocco, and Tunisia. We cannot be number one in size taking into account the size of our economy, but certainly we will stay among the main regional banking centers. We are operating in more than 10 Arab countries and 20 other non-Arab countries. We have a lot of Arab investors in the capital of our banks. I believe we will continue to play the role of an active regional banking center, even though the competition is strong.
</p><h4>
	<span></span>What are your expectations for the year ahead?
</h4><p>
	<span></span>I do not see any dramatic changes occurring in 2015 for the Lebanese banking industry. We are fighting to keep our industry developing at a good growth rate—aiming at 6-7%—and if we can attain such a growth rate, it will be enough to finance our economy and the public sector in foreign and Lebanese currencies. We need a minimum amount of growth to continue to serve our economy and state adequately. Our other main objective is to maintain banking stability and not to have any ripples in the system. The structure of prices is expected to stay stable also in 2015; this is a manageable issue.<span></span>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In June 2014, Banker ME officially designated Bank of Beirut as “The Fastest Growing Bank in Lebanon" for 2013. To what do you attribute that success?</h4><p><span></span>It was the vitality and dynamism of my colleagues. We operate in a team-oriented environment; I believe we were very fortunate to have been able to bring together a remarkable team at all levels and in all divisions. We are one of, if not the, youngest bank in the marketplace. The average age of our staff members is the lowest in the banking industry of Lebanon. What differentiates us is that upon taking over Bank of Beirut in 1993, we did not inherit a senior generation of employees. Our team is very young and highly educated. We do not spare any effort to employ additional well experienced staff from overseas who can further add to our existing knowhow and experience; as their international exposure would enhance our business.  The advantage of one bank over another is the extent of opportunities captured from the new generation of bankers as the tools currently utilized are much more sophisticated than those in the past. A young team provides a high competitive edge to our daily operations. The outlook is different, the horizons are different, and the energy is unlimited.</p><h4>How would you assess Bank of Beirut's performance in 2014?</h4><p><span></span>We did very well in 2014 in all growth indicators. Our total assets grew by 9.69% year- over- year, and net profit after tax increased by 20.65%, to reach $175 million. For the last 20 years, Bank of Beirut has each year outperformed the previous one. It is obviously another consequence of the productivity of each and every team member in all market segments. </p><h4>What strategy will Bank of Beirut follow to sustain growth in 2015?</h4><p><span></span>Bank of Beirut is primarily a trade finance oriented bank. Each bank has its own characteristics. We are the leader in the market in trade finance, in housing loans, and in asset management. We intend to add additional segments in the near future. Regretfully, 2015 will be much different than the previous years. The regional environment is politically more difficult. Our markets are smaller. The Lebanese market itself has shrunk due to the prevailing political situation in the country. If we should add the pressures imposed from compliance procedures throughout the region, we could say that 2015 would be more taxing than the previous years. Growth is sustained through two types of strategies; one is human-oriented, whereby we keep our teams well motivated by constantly assessing their performance. This is the role of management.   The second type of strategy is beyond our control. It is highly linked to the political environment, be it in Lebanon or the region. We will therefore do our best and pray that all will turn out in our favor.</p><h4>What role does innovation play at Bank of Beirut?</h4><p><span></span>Bank of Beirut offers plenty of innovative solutions. Most importantly, is to take advantage at the right time of any added solution. We are here to assess and introduce fresh solutions to our customers' needs. More often than not you do not need a Ferrari to drive to the city as it is not always the case that high technologies serve your objectives; but rather the necessary technologies that would serve your objectives. Our IT people are always keen to acquire new technology and we are enthusiastic about new achievements. Here, we have to assess the right innovation at the appropriate time. Our markets are not yet as sophisticated as the highly developed markets, such as, the UK or the US. Our markets are more customer-oriented, to the extent that we have to adjust and to cater to our customers' needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess the current state of the relations between Lebanon and Mexico?</h4><p><span></span>2015 marks the 70th Anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Lebanon and Mexico. Our relationship is mature and vibrant, nurtured by constant political dialogue, growing trade and investment flows, and a desire to cooperate in an increasing number of areas of development. Together, we have witnessed seven decades of friendship, solidarity, cooperation, and mutual trust. Relations between Mexico and Lebanon offer a vivid example of hard work, shared values, and building confidence in the future, and our 70 years of common history are witness to that. Endowed with such a legacy, the two countries will now aim higher in this most valued relationship.</p><h4>What are the main highlights of your visit to Lebanon, and your Lebanese counterpart to Mexico?</h4><p><span></span>I went to Lebanon to further enhance our bilateral relationship, bearing in mind that Mexico is home to close to half a million people of Lebanese origin, an important force in our economy, society, and culture. The Lebanese diaspora is no doubt the most visible and dynamic bridge between our countries today, and will continue to be an essential asset for our shared development in the future. In addition to my visit in February 2015, Mexico had the honor of hosting Lebanon's Minister of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants, Mr. Gebran Bassil. On that occasion, Minister Bassil and I discussed important bilateral and regional issues, and signed agreements to promote deeper knowledge of our respective societies and cultures. We also agreed on various programs that will draw our respective diplomatic academies closer together, and will also allow us to share better practices in terms of the protection of our nationals living abroad. With my visit to the beautiful country of Lebanon, we followed up on those initiatives and added others to strengthen our cooperation, facilitate our trade and investment relations, turn our markets into preferred entry points to the Middle East and Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively, and promote more frequent parliamentary contacts. </p><h4>How do you envision the future of the relations between the two countries and what areas of cooperation will you focus on the most in the coming years?</h4><p><span></span>Mexico and Lebanon have enjoyed friendly relations for a long time, and the two nations have profited from this in an important way. However, our level of development and the modernization of our economies offer us great potential and possibilities that we must be able to develop and take advantage of for the benefit of our peoples. Frequent high-level political dialogue is an asset to both countries, which will allow us to identify new areas of collaboration, and successfully address any challenges we may face. Our respective private sectors have also set out to increase their involvement in a number of attractive sectors in each other's markets, such as agriculture, telecommunications, energy, and pharmaceuticals. To spearhead specific projects, during my visit, a Mexico-Lebanon Business Forum took place in Beirut, with the active participation of key Mexican and Mexican-Lebanese entrepreneurs. Mexico is also aware of the lively cultural scene in Lebanon. Various Lebanese figures, living in this country or elsewhere, have claimed worldwide attention in many fields. This is the case, for example, of writers such as Hoda Barakat, Elias Khoury, and Lena Merhej; designers Nicolas Jebran and Elie Saab; architects Nabil Gholam and Hashim Sarkis; or artists such as Juliana Seraphim, Saliba Douaihy, or the Armenian Lebanese painter Paul Guiragossian. This cultural bloom is also evident in Mexico. We are determined to bring more Mexican culture to Lebanon, and to promote cultural events that will showcase our history, traditions, and current artistic innovation. We take inspiration in Minister Bassil's phrase “Our border is the world," the slogan of the Lebanese Diaspora Energy Conference 2014, an event that reinforced the bonds between Lebanese residents and emigrants worldwide. Mexicans of Lebanese origin, and indeed Mexicans themselves, believe borders pose no limits to creativity and community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the largest bank in Lebanon, how does Bank Audi contribute to the country's GDP?</h4><p>We are the largest contributor to GDP formation in Lebanon. Our contribution amounts to close to 1.8%, which is huge, especially when you consider that there are more than 600,000 economic units in the country, and for one single unit to contribute as much as we do is very significant. We are also the largest employer in the private sector and the largest deposit taker. We are also the largest financier to the domestic economy in both its public and private sector components. Moreover, we are the largest taxpayer underscoring our large sense of corporate governance and social responsibility. We have a fiduciary responsibility as the largest bank in the country towards the financial sector as a whole, and a responsibility to adhere to best practices in terms of governance, compliance, and financial disclosure.</p><h4>How would you assess the last financial year for Bank Audi, and what do you expect for 2015?</h4><p>The fact that Bank Audi is a group rather than a single bank means our consolidated position encompasses the financials of principally 11 banks and three financial companies present in 12 countries outside Lebanon, covering various business lines. We cannot link the consolidated performance to only one single operating environment and the Group's activity is not evenly spread across the 12 countries. There are in fact four main development pillars: Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, and the private banking business line which represent more than 90% of assets and earnings.</p><p>The soundness of the diversification strategy adopted by the Bank was again confirmed by the Bank's performance in 2014, efficiently driving a sustained growth in spite of the persisting challenging operating environment while enhancing the Group's competitive positioning. Consolidated assets grew by 15.9% to exceed, for the first time, the $40 billion threshold, highlighting the Bank's capacity to attract new customers and expand its range of services. In parallel, consolidated net profits rose by 15% relative to 2013 to reach $350 million, translating into an ROAE of 13.6%. This performance stems in particular from entities operating in Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and private banking entities and reinforced the Group's position among the top 20 Arab banks at large.</p><p>The results of 1H2015 are in line with those achieved in 2014, whereby the Group's performance continued to reflect Bank Audi's privileged position in key markets of presence. Indeed, we have an undisputed leadership in Lebanon, we are also the seventh private sector's bank in Egypt and the thirteenth deposit bank in Turkey out of 34 operating commercial banks in just 30 months of operation. We have also close to $10 billion in assets under management booked in our private banking entities mainly in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon, a level which compares well with that of the regional Arab banking institutions.</p><h4>How are Bank Audi's operations in Turkey developing and how do you envision Odea Bank advancing over the medium term?</h4><p>Starting from scratch in November 2012, the assets of Odea Bank, our subsidiary in Turkey, reached $10.8 billion at end-June 2015, reflecting a solid customer attraction and business development capacity, and positioning Odea Bank 13th among the deposits bank in Turkey.</p><p>In parallel, Odea Bank has started to be profitable after 19 months since launch, posting $15.8 million net profits in 2014. In 1H2015, Odea Bank recorded $16.6 million of net earnings, representing a rising trend that management is looking to turn into an exponential growth.</p><p>This performance is attributed to the fact that Turkey is a sizeable emerging country with a track record of sustained economic growth, reaching on average 5.4% per annum over the last 4 years, but also to the best-in breed talent pool of Odea Bank and its pioneering role in terms of innovation, granting it significant market competitive advantages.</p><p>Building on the significant performances achieved so far, our plan in Turkey is to develop a value-added SMEs and consumer lending segment while leveraging on the wide footprint in the MENA region to benefit from the expected growth of trade, financial and human flows between Turkey and Arab countries to further develop corporate and commercial banking.</p><p>Today, Turkey is subject to a lot of volatility as a result of the change in the policies of the US Federal Reserve Bank and of the prevailing domestic political disputes impacting the sentiment of foreign and local investors and affecting the exchange rates and banking operating conditions. This environment may slightly delay our business plan but we, as long-term investors, are confident we are going to achieve our growth targets in Turkey over the medium term despite of the highly vilified environment in the short term against which we are putting in place the needed contingency planning.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>According to the World Bank's report on the Global Economic Prospects, Lebanon is among the non-oil-producing economies in the region expected to see reasonable growth from 2015 to 2017. What is the Ministry's outlook for the Lebanese economy over the medium term?</h4><p><span></span>Most forecasts indicate an increase in economic growth rates in the year 2015; however, this improvement primarily depends on a better security situation and on political stability, which can revive the economy and allow an increase in the various economic sectors' activities. Political stability will be achieved, first and most importantly, by the election of the President of the Lebanese Republic as soon as possible in order to rebuild investor and consumer confidence and increase capital inflows to Lebanon. It should be noted that in spite of all that the Lebanese economy has endured since has 2011, it was able to record positive rates of growth, ranging between 1% and 1.5%. This is evidence of the economy's immunity and ability to survive in the face of these crises. In addition, the IMF raised its estimate for growth to 2.5% in 2015, according to its latest report.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to improve Lebanon's balance of trade?</h4><p><span></span>The Ministry's aim is to promote Lebanon as a trade partner in foreign markets and this is being done through pursuing an action plan and a program of meetings, which aim to activate economic diplomacy with countries outside of the Middle East. Economic diplomacy is the use of the full spectrum of economic tools of the state to achieve its national interest. Economic diplomacy includes all the economic activities related to export, import, investment, lending, aid, and free trade agreements. As such, various meetings with the ambassadors of countries that Lebanon wishes to expand its economic and trade relations with are taking place. Moreover, the Ministry is mobilizing potential trade agreements that would facilitate the market access of Lebanese products such as the free trade agreements (FTA) with Aghadir Countries (Jordan, Egypt, Tunisia, and Morocco) and the MERCOSUR countries (Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Venezuela). On top of this, MoET organized the Lebanon EU Trade, Industry, and Agriculture Services and Internal markets subcommittees, where major subjects were discussed to increase the trade exchange and facilitate the market access to European countries.</p><h4>What is the role of public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the development of the economy, what initiatives are aimed at strengthening the investment climate and promoting the country as a FDI destination?</h4><p><span></span>The primary objective of the PPP is to be able to use the experience and the ability of private funding on the public platform, whereby investments are private and are managed by the private sector, but within the legal framework depicted in the PPP law. As such, reforms should be set and implemented, in terms of liberalization of economic sectors such as electricity and telecommunications, and in terms of securing an investment climate that allows the development of a suitable economic infrastructure for the execution of existing and expected activities such as oil extraction. On another note, and in regard to the initiatives aimed at strengthening the investment climate and promoting the country as a FDI destination, the MoET launched the “Lebanon SME strategy: a roadmap to 2020," which aims to accelerate the creation of startups, increase the productivity of existing SMEs, and improve the performance of existing SMEs. The main pillars of this strategy are to improve access to finance for startups and existing SMEs particularly through equity financing, strengthen and upgrading the legal and regulatory framework for businesses, facilitate access to markets for SMEs and increasing their compliance with international standards, upgrade the skills available and aligning them with the needs of businesses, and promote innovation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How was Inelco established?</h4><p>The company was founded in Bogotá in 1937. My uncle Alvaro Velasquez graduated from MIT in 1934 and his partner, Alfredo Otero graduated from the University of Louvain in Belgium. After working for three years at Empresa de Energí­a de Bogotá (the electricity utility in Bogotá), they decided to establish their own business. Inelco is an acronym for Electrical Engineers of Colombia. In 1949, they decided the time was ripe for expansion, whereupon they founded Inelco Del Pacifico Ltda in the city of Cali. The company became Inelco SA in 2003 when the corporation type changed.</p><p>Inelco throughout the years has participated in several entrepreneurial projects, founding energy related companies. In the middle of the last century there was very little manufacturing of electrical products in Colombia, whereby Inelco imported all necessary electrical conductors as well as overhauled machinery from Canada, thereby founding Fadaltec SA (cable manufacturer) as partners of Canada Wire. Fadaltec merged into what today is Centelsa, the largest cable manufacturer in Colombia. Cables and conductors represent about 30-35% of the cost of an electrical project, whereby being able to produce our own conductors gave us a valuable strategic advantage. We also manufacture the electrical switchgear that safeguard a building against short circuits and overloads. This is performed through our affiliate company Tableros Electricos SA. Tablesa has just turned 25 years old.</p><p>At Inelco SA we have an engineering services business model somewhat different from others employed in our country. Inelco is an established company, with the holding company managing all back office processes such as accounting, purchasing, quality system, and logistics for our several business units. Our business division units are energy divisions, which acts as an EPC contractors for electrical projects. They target infrastructure, industry, large commercial malls, office buildings, hospitals. The structured cabling division is responsible for installing local area computer networks, and the voice and data communications networks. The electronic security division, is responsible for installing fire detection systems, access controls and closed circuit TVs (CCTV), and building automation. Our service ivision performs outsourcing of manual-labor for maintenance of public lighting networks in various different towns across the Cauca Valle for EPSA (Regional Utility Company), as well as industrial maintenance. Our commercial division retails electrical products. We are initiating an energy efficiency division and are searching for business partners in LED lighting, photovoltaic systems, and related equipment. Our manufacturing affiliate TABLESA SA, produces medium and low voltage electric switchgear and switchboards that are the cabinets that house electrical equipment. This is an OEM operation (Original Equipment Manufacturer) that integrates products from companies such as Schneider, Eaton and ABB. </p><p>Additionally to local sales, Tablesa performs exports to México, Panamá, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.</p><h4>Which sectors are witnessing the most pronounced growth today?</h4><p>Regarding our projects, in infrastructure for instance, in conjunction with another company, we are building the EPC electrical works for a new Aguadulce port, in the city of Buenaventura. It will provide storage for refrigerated containers for a joint venture between Malaysian and Philippine companies: or Sociedad Puerto Industrial Aguadulce (SPIA). We are currently initiating the international terminal expansion for the local airport of Cali.  In the industrial sector, we undertook all electrical works for the SAB Miller Bavaria Brewery. We also built the electrical works at the new soap plant for Unilever, which is a 10-story plant; as well as the logistic distribution centers for Unilever and P&amp;G. We have also built the electrical works for several large commercial shopping centers. Our focus has remained on EPC projects for infrastructure, industry, large commercial centers, hotels and office buildings, and hospitals.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services for the next year?</h4><p>The main challenges faced by the industry are finding resources to operate the various interconnected institutions such as the Times of Zambia and the Daily Mail. All media houses face obstacles in terms of finances and equipment. The balance sheets for the four major media houses are in the negative and are not attracting meaningful investment. As a result they are unable to borrow from the capital markets because of the state of their finances. These are historic debts, and we are keen to negotiate for debt to be transferred into shares in these entities. Then we can look into floating certain companies to the general public and raising foreign capitalization. As soon as the cabinet gives its approval, this process will commence.</p><h4>What is the status of the digital migration project?</h4><p>That is the largest program we are working on today. The first phase is worth close to $9 million and the second and third phases are worth more than $150 million. The second phase will encompass all areas of Zambia, that is, the whole country will have digital television. We recently completed phase one, and we switched urban areas to digital television in June before the deadline. Financing for the remaining phases will be done through Exim Bank of China. </p><h4>What role does media and information transparency play in the socio-economic development of the country?</h4><p>The media naturally has considerable influence on the socioeconomic development of the country. A healthy media is aware of its rights to express a viewpoint, but should also be aware of potential damage that can be done to the broader economy by presenting the nation in negative light. This has the potential to impact investor interest negatively. On the social front, the media is important in terms of its role in informing the general public of key domestic developments and government programmes. The media is the Fourth Estate after the executive, the judiciary, and the legislature; meaning that the media provides the watchdog role for the arms of government and society as a whole. The media also plays the role of being the marketplace of ideas where people are provided with information for them to make informed decisions.</p><h4>What role is the radio playing in the dissemination of information given the low levels of literacy in Zambia?</h4><p>Although we are migrating from analogue to digital broadcasting, since independence, not all citizens have had access to radio because transmitters were not spread out to all areas of the country. The government has since installed transmitters and is still installing through ZNBC to all areas that have faced this challenge. I recently officiated at the installation of transmitters in Mufumbwe North Western Province and my predecessors have officiated in Shang'ombo, Chilubi, Mulobezi, Luwingu, and Shiwang'andu, among others. The government has also operationalized the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) to quicken the pace of giving radio licences to would-be owners of private radio stations and so 71 radio stations are operational through-out the country. This has meant people accessing radio in almost all parts of the country and this means they are given a wider platform for them to make their decisions.</p><h4>How is the e-government project set to improve information flow between the government and the public?</h4><p>The Zambian government has embarked on a project to take government services closer to the people through an ICT platform called Government Wide Area Network. Under this platform, 24 Government Ministries and other Government Institutions have been interconnected in Lusaka. The programme will cover all provincial centres and the entire country. The project will result in a high capacity transport tier to accommodate and carry all planned government ICT applications and services such as e-mails, e-health, and e-education, reduced internet costs, and a stable, centralised, and fast internet connection to all sites once the project is complete.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>My expectation is that by the end of the year we shall have a contractor on our digital migration sites to role-out phase two and three of our digital migration project. My expectation also is that our economy will grow by between 7 and 8% in the coming year, and this will provide the state with sufficient funds to run the social and economic programs of the country. We are interdependent with other countries, and aim to make good use of international practices and set an example for the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kuwait's FDI landscape evolved in recent years and what have been some of the major changes in FDI law creating lucrative incentives for foreign investors in Kuwait?</h4><p>Kuwait has recently witnessed several favorable developments in its regulatory and legal framework that contributed to enhance its attractiveness as an investment location. The issuance of new Law No. 116 of 2013 for promoting direct investment in the State of Kuwait, which had replaced the previous FDI Law No. 8 of 2001, had stipulated several welcomed additions accommodating to the international best practices pertaining to FDI. The main additional features included establishing a public authority, Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA), which is mandated with the tasks of encouraging both local and foreign investors, promoting Kuwait as an attractive investment location, and streamlining business environment to enhance the country's competitiveness. It also brought forward the shift to adopt the negative list approach for sectors that are excluded from licensing, speeding up the licensing process to a maximum 30 days by establishing a one-stop shop; allowing 100% foreign ownership by selecting one of several forms of legal entities; introducing the licensing of representative offices solely to conduct marketing studies for interested investors; and extending incentives and exemptions to both privatization projects and Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects. On the other hand, the new investment law had maintained incentives like tax and customs duties exemptions, and guarantees against expropriation, transfer of capital and profits, and protecting project proprietary information.</p><h4>What economic sectors are open to foreign investors in Kuwait?</h4><p>The adoption of the negative list approach sent a positive signal to FDI investors that most economic sectors are open for investments, in accordance with Council of Ministers decision issued February 2015, whereby it excluded very few sectors for sovereignty purposes like upstream oil and gas, or other considerations. Furthermore, we did not place a threshold for the size of investments legible for licensing, neither focused on merely targeting FDI as source of capital per se, as our objective is effectively placed on the value added and quality investments that would serve as anchors to originate competitive advantage, enhance productivity, and foster national capabilities.</p><h4>What role can FDI play in Kuwaitization and the government's ongoing efforts to create job and training opportunities for Kuwaitis, attracting know-how and innovation to add value to the domestic economy?</h4><p>We are currently undertaking the necessary steps to develop our business strategy and formulate the ensuing promotional and communications strategies, with the relevant roadmap and action plan to assist us to achieve the tasks we are mandated with under our establishing law, and in view of the “national vision 2035," and the strategic objectives identified in the medium term economic development plans. In this regard, we intend to target efficiency seeking investors that would contribute to transferring know-how and modern technology into Kuwait, support the economic diversification efforts, build national R&amp;D, as well as innovative capabilities, in addition to creating jobs for Kuwaiti youth, and providing quality training opportunities. </p><h4>How will the new investment law serve foreign companies and investors looking to do business in Kuwait?</h4><p>The new investment law has allowed for various legal entry points for foreign investors to establish a Kuwaiti company in accordance with the new commercial companies' law in Kuwait, allowing for 100% foreign ownership for Limited Liability Companies, Shareholding Companies, and One Person Companies. Furthermore, Law No. 116 of 2013 allows for opening foreign branches and representative offices as other available alternatives, based on the needs of foreign companies. However, foreign branches and representative offices should adhere to certain considerations and provide requested legal and financial information of their respective mother company, as specified in the related decisions to ensure proper procedures.</p><h4>What are some upcoming government and infrastructure development projects in Kuwait that are expected to be of high impact to the local economy?</h4><p>Kuwait offers a host of lucrative investment opportunities including strategic projects under the current development plan in sectors pertaining to oil and gas, North Zone development, electricity and water, urban development and housing, transport and communications, health, education, tourism and media, and environment. There are also other opportunities under the PPP projects and the privatization program. We are looking forward to attract FDI that will create needed linkages with our thriving SMEs sector and the start ups by local entrepreneurs. We have updated an investment guide that can also assist interested investors in considering various potential opportunities found on our website. We are developing three economic zones in the North, West and South of the country which will offer an attractive opportunity for various competitive industries to operate in Kuwait.</p><h4>What will be KDIPA's priorities over the coming years and what role do you seek to play in servicing direct investment in Kuwait?</h4><p>KDIPA's priorities will be formulated under its upcoming strategy, which is still under preparation. In this regard, and as KDIPA is one of the implementing arms of our country's national economic policy, its strategic plan will be linked to contribute to attaining the targeted objectives of the economic development plan, especially in terms of increasing the share of the private sector in GDP, raising the share of Kuwaitis employment in the total labour force, and increasing expenditure on R&amp;D. On the other hand, KDIPA currently through its Investors Service Centre (ISC) is providing needed facilitation to interested investors, responding to  incoming inquiries, suggestions or complaints, as well as supporting  the potential and existing investors to make their experience a success in Kuwait. Through our commitment to offer all needed aftercare, we shall be encouraging investors to settle, grow, and consider expanding their business in the future. We are keen to attract and welcome establishing high value added investments that will buttress the country's economic development agenda.</p><h4>What are your expectations for KDIPA in the year ahead (2016)?</h4><p>We hope that 2016 will be a significant year for KDIPA, as by then we will complete the move to our new premises, hire needed staff who will be carrying out the designated tasks, put into action our strategic plan, and eventually embark on our ambitious promotional campaign that will brand Kuwait, target investors into priority sectors, and streamline business environment to enhance competitiveness in order to achieve the needed sustainable growth and economic diversification. We shall be also enhancing our cooperation with other relevant government entities, the national SMEs Fund, the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, among various stakeholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Test of Time]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-test-of-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the bilateral relationship between the UAE and the UK?</h4><p>Our relationship with the UAE is strong and getting stronger. It is well established and has stood the test of time. Its strength and depth can best be seen in the broad range of areas on which we work together closely for mutual benefit. For example, there exists a healthy bilateral trade relationship between our two countries, worth $19 billion by the end of 2013, and the UK-UAE Business Council has set a goal to increase trade to $32 billion by 2020. We work together politically and militarily to tackle common threats to our security in the region. All of this is aided by the close relationships between our businesses, institutions, and people; there are in excess of 4,000 British businesses operating in the UAE, around 120,000 British nationals reside there, and more than a million visit each year. In return, more than 250,000 visits to the UK are made by Emiratis each year, and all of this reinforces and ensures the continuing and ever-growing friendship between our two countries.</p><h4>What opportunities exist for UK-based companies to invest in the UAE?</h4><p>The UK trades with the UAE across a broad spectrum of sectors and at all levels. The types of UK business trading with the UAE range from small and specialized companies to large multinationals such as Shell, BP, HSBC, Carillion, Rolls Royce, and many more. Our bilateral trade with UAE increased from $11 billion in 2009 to $16 billion in 2013 and was at $17 billion for 2014. Exports have increased across a broad range of sectors. These include food and drink, wood, textiles, iron and steel, inorganic chemicals, machinery, vehicles, telecoms equipment, and much more. We are also seeing new opportunities in infrastructure, leisure, and tourism for companies both large and small.</p><h4>How important is it for the UK to pursue investment opportunities for clean energy and renewable resources in the UAE?</h4><p>The government left January's World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi in no doubt as to the commitment the Emiratis have to this agenda. The UK and the UAE are close partners in the development of clean energy research and policies. As an example, the UAE is already a major investor in the UK, primarily through the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar). Currently, Masdar holds a 20% stake in the London Array offshore wind farm. More recently, they acquired a 35% stake in the Dudgeon Offshore Wind Farm off the Norfolk coast, making them the single largest investor in wind energy in the UK. These projects combined will generate enough “green" electricity to power almost one million homes in the UK each year, and our partnership with the UAE has made the UK the global leader in offshore wind power; we now have more installed capacity than the rest of the world put together. With the creation of an ambitious renewable energy agenda, the UAE has a strategy to develop alternative sources of energy and produce 7% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. As a long-term partner, we remain ready to support that ambition.</p><h4>How do you see Dubai's Al Maktoum International Airport expansion affecting global logistics and transport and what opportunity does this bring to UK-based companies?</h4><p>Dubai has now firmly secured its status as a global transport and logistics hub. In January 2015, Dubai International Airport surpassed Heathrow as the world's busiest airport for international passengers. This development has primarily been on the back of Emirates Airline's phenomenal growth in the last three decades. The ambitious expansion program planned for Al-Maktoum International Airport (AMIA) will make it the biggest airport in the world by 2050 with the capacity to handle 255 million passengers a year. The entire development will cover an area of 56 square kilometers and it is due to be completed by the end of 2021. AMIA will be part of the world's first 140-sq-km purpose-built aerotropolis, Dubai World Central (DWC), which is expected to be completed by 2022. DWC will connect AMIA to land and sea links through major roads, rail, and metro links as well as the Jebel Ali port across from DWC. It will also include the Expo 2020 site, which is expected to host 25 million visitors. UK companies are well placed to take advantage of these opportunities, especially given the support from UK Export Finance (UKEF), the UK's official export credit agency. UKEF has made an initial offer of $2 billion of export credit guarantees to Dubai Aviation Engineering Projects (DAEP) for this project. The UKEF offer puts UK companies in a favorable position to bid for tenders for this project because in order to avail the funding, a minimum of 20% content (goods and services) has to be sourced from UK companies. I believe their offer puts British companies in a strong bidding position. Additional support for UK companies is provided by UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI) and the British Embassy in Dubai, which have set up an Airports Working Group that will assist companies looking to be part of the AMIA development and the other airports projects in the UAE.</p><h4>What role does the UAE play in the security of the Middle East?</h4><p>The UAE's security is the UK's security. Our military relationship has been cultivated over many years, as evidenced by more Emirati officers graduating from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, than from any other country other than the UK. But equally, it is a vibrant and dynamic relationship, built around common values, understanding, and mutual respect. It is this that binds us together as we face future security challenges together. A key element of this military relationship is the continued UK military presence in the UAE. Historically this was with the Trucial Scouts and the Royal Air Force at Sharjah. Today British military personnel, fast jets, and aerial surveillance helicopters are working alongside the highly capable and extremely professional UAE Armed Forces to collectively maintain a safe and secure region. The UAE is a vital ally in the fight against terrorism. Not only has the UAE supported the international community through reliable access, basing, and over-flights, its military has made substantial contributions, most recently in Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, and the coalition against ISIL, but before that in the first Gulf War. The UAE's work in supporting stability in the region is not confined to the military. The UAE is the first Gulf State to form a dedicated development ministry. In 2013, the UAE became the world's largest aid donor in proportion to gross national income (1.34% ODA/GNI) with an aid budget that amounted to $5.2bn. The UK and the UAE have a track record of working together on issues in the Middle East; I hope this trend of ever-closer partnership will continue.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Education policy has been at the forefront of the national agenda since the country set out to achieve Vision 2020 in the early nineties. What have been some of the key milestones?</h4><p>Higher education in Malaysia has undergone a comprehensive transformation with several milestones having been achieved over the past few years. The introduction of our five research universities in 2006 was a landmark milestone; the presence of these five research universities has contributed to more publications, citations, and R&amp;D in the country. This has resulted in more and better lecturers who have really lifted us to the level we are at today. All of our five universities rank among the top 1% in the world. That is a landmark position achieved in the last 1-2 years, with the foundations having been laid in 2006 via the Research Universities project. Another area that deserves recognition is in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET). We have 31 such programs and colleges involved in technical training. We undertake project growth in TVET in the same capacity, and are launching even more programs as we approach 2025. There are more collaborations happening with industries and corporations as well. We have the CEO Faculty Program, where the top CEOs come in and lecture our university students. We have local company CEOs, such as AirAsia on board, in addition to Shell, Samsung, and other large companies. We have 22 big names at the moment coming in to teach at our facilities, and this will continue to expand over the next few years. Moving forward, in April 2015, we launched the Malaysia Education Blueprint 2015-2025 (Higher Education). This Higher Education Blueprint lays down the 10 shifts or key areas of growth for our higher education sector, from student outcomes to better financial management to greater autonomy for our institutions of higher learning.</p><h4>Malaysia is part of the global trend towards the internationalization of higher education, with a number of prestigious foreign universities having set up branch campuses here. Why have they chosen Malaysia?</h4><p>In order to set up campuses you need lecturers, which requires the level of local talent that we are capable of providing. They also need students who are willing to pay, and we have that here as well. Students come in from China, India, and Indonesia, and the economic growth rate here of 5-6% is strong. We are promoting ourselves as an educational hub for the region; this is an appealing proposition for both students and staff, and we also enjoy solid government support. Our national bank (Bank Negara Malaysia), in collaboration with the MIT Sloan School of Management, will be starting the Asia School of Business this fall, and we also have many schools in the private sector that are witnessing growth.</p><h4>What role do exchange programs play in fostering bilateral relations between Malaysia and other countries?</h4><p>Exchange programs are extremely important. We have students who come here from all over the world, including about 150 from the New Zealand and Australia, and we hope to see even more. We welcome students who attend summer study course firsts as a tester for more lengthy study. Students from Mexico also come here, and we hope to attract more students from European countries. We have many students coming in from Australia in a reciprocity program we are keen to advance. Currently, there are about 104,000 international students studying in Malaysia. Out of this amount, 29,000 are pursuing graduate studies (i.e. master's and PhD). This is encouraging as it shows that we have quality offerings, and that international students (many of whom are sponsored) see Malaysia as a choice destination for advanced levels of higher education.</p><h4>What can be done to promote the subjects of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)?</h4><p>Science has to be encouraged at the high school level in order to promote learning in college and university. STEM promotion will help advance industries and research to where they need to be. Right now we have a 40:60 ratio between science and the liberal arts, and we want to shift the balance further toward the sciences. Here the sciences are not a male-dominated subject, and we have an overall female ratio of around 70% at universities. At the ministry, our Director General is a woman, and has two deputies who are both women. And there are many other women in the field as well. It is not as easy for women to achieve leadership positions, but it does start with education and we proud to have capable leaders at the forefront of the Ministry who are amazing women in their own right. The public is still less likely to accept a woman in a position of leadership, but it is just a matter of time. While in many Muslim countries, the status of women is curbed, this is not the case in Malaysia.</p><h4>What will your priorities be over the next 10 years? </h4><p>Ensuring that we realize the goals of our Higher Education Blueprint 2015-2025 through the 10 shifts identified will be where most of focus lay over the next 10 years. Right now our main focus is on producing holistic, entrepreneurial, and balanced graduates. Ultimately, what we do is for the students and they are our top priority. We deliver this through the integrated CGPA or iCGPA, a concept that we have been developing for the past six years, and which our professors have been testing out. In four to five years, the program should be fully integrated. Another area of focus is making sure that we have industries on campus. We want industries on campus to start teaching our students, and we want 30% of our lecturers to be people from outside. Our CEO Faculty Program works to make classes more relevant, and this is an initiative which we have in our Higher Education Blueprint.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect more and more from our professors, and we want the top minds to come and lecture. We currently have four professors who have been recognized as part of the “World's Most Influential Scientific Minds" by a well-known organization. These four individuals were recognized for being the top 1% most cited in their fields of research. At the same time, the University of Malaya (UM) is aiming for a top 50 place in Engineering in the next 2-3 years. Currently, Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) and UM have one subject each in the world's top 50, namely Environmental Sciences and Developmental Studies at 31st and 32nd spots, respectively. We have many top 100 programs in subjects like agriculture, chemical, civil and mechanical engineering, architecture and more. Yet we aim to improve further still over the coming years. Our country has advanced from 28th to 27th place in the Universitas' 21 Ranking of National Higher Education System and we aim for a top 25 place in the next few years. We are improving and it is my hope to see us continually improve. As such, our tagline in the Ministry of Higher Education is that we are “Soaring Upwards."</p>]]></richbody0content>
