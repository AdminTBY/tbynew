		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major ongoing projects for KOC currently?</h4><p>KOC is implementing a comprehensive capital investment program for the next five years that will allow us to increase our production capacity in line with our 2020 plan. There are several projects that are key to realizing this aim, one being the implementation of an intensive drilling program of an estimated 400-500 wells to be drilled per year for the next five years, including application of the latest drilling technologies to maximize recovery from our reservoirs. Our drilling rig fleet at KOC has been increased in order to cope with this increase and efficiencies of our drilling operations are being optimized to achieve even more of an increase in the future. We have also embarked on two major field development programs focused on water injection plans in West Kuwait in order to maintain the current 500 mbpd production capacity of the area and increase it beyond current levels to 550 mbpd. In addition to that, there are three major development programs ongoing in the South and East Kuwait area, including a major water injection facility and a new gathering center to assist in S&amp;EK of that area, maintaining its 1.7 billion bpd production capacity target. In the North Kuwait area, we have started three major development programs, including three new gathering centers and another water injection facility to increase the conventional oil production capacity to 1 million bpd. We have begun the development of Phase I of the Heavy Oil program to reach production of 60 million barrels in Lower Fars reservoir, a program that includes the HO production facility and transit pipeline, as well as the associated export facilities. We are moving even closer towards our goal of bringing oil production to more than 350 mbpd and non-associated gas to 1 billion cubic feet per day by 2022 with the development of the second and third phases of the North Kuwait Jurassic reserves, a major step forward in our long term strategy. In the interim, KOC is developing three Jurassic production facilities to expedite the development of the Jurassic reserves during 2017. </p><h4>What role does international cooperation play in KOC's strategy?</h4><p>International cooperation is important for KOC to achieve its strategic goals. As we move to develop heavy oil and non-associated gas production, and as we enter offshore exploration and development and move towards the tertiary production techniques in our conventional crude oil reservoirs, the participation of IOCs through Enhanced Technical Service Agreements (ETSA) will add significant value that will support KOC in the long term. We already have an ETSA with an IOC to support the development of non-associated gas production in the Jurassic reservoirs located in North Kuwait, and we look forward to starting additional ETSAs with other international companies to support other projects within KOC in the near future.</p><h4>What are the changing employment demands of the oil and gas business, and where do you see the greatest need for further human capital development in Kuwait's oil industry?</h4><p>Future challenges appear in the rising demand for the application of new technologies, additional drilling activities, and increasing well surveillance activities and operations. This demands more employment in the technical fields. The greatest need lies in the demand of experienced employees, such as the ones who have experience in EOR processes. Our need for experienced manpower is directly proportional to the growing capital investments and complexity of our operations, which is becoming more and more demanding in the coming few years.</p><h4>How do you see supply and demand evolving in the oil industry globally in the near future, and what role will Kuwait's oil play in the global energy mix?</h4><p>We expect that global oil consumption will continue increasing through the coming years, reaching around 110 mbpd by 2040 from a current consumption of approximately 92 mbpd. The main consumption growth will take place in India, China, and the Middle East; regional OPEC countries will play a significant role in providing the required increment in production capacity to supply this oil demand increase. Our advantage of having one of the lowest oil production and development costs in the world, together with the continued implementation of our strategic plan, will keep placing Kuwait as one of the most important oil producers in the region and worldwide. We will continue building our production capacity as per our 2020 strategy to ensure that we continue maintaining our position as a reliable crude oil supplier to the international market in the short and long term. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KIC is the oldest insurance provider in Kuwait. What growth have you seen in the company over the years?</h4><p>The local insurance industry began in 1960 with the founding of KIC. Over our 55 years in operation, the company grew from an initial INR5 million to our current size of KWD150 million ($492.6 million). There were agencies before 1960, but no local Kuwaiti companies. KIC was the first company, established by top Kuwaiti merchants of that period. Shortly after founding KIC in Kuwait, the company opened branches throughout the GCC, in countries like Lebanon and Jordan. KIC was the first insurance company in Kuwait with branches throughout the region. At the time of its founding, the risks were significantly different than they are today. We are now faced with new and difficult challenges, especially in terms of environmental degradation and cyber terrorism, which are both difficult for insurers to address. We have to collaborate with insurers worldwide to devise solutions for protecting individuals in today's world.</p><h4>How did KIC achieve its recently upgraded Moody's rating from Baa1 to A3 with a stable outlook?</h4><p>This improvement was a result of our stable management. Stable management sends a strong message to clients that a company is reliable, and we are proud of KCI's organizational management. This upgraded rating is also a result of our staff, which is behind the growth and success of our company. Our underwriters are of the best caliber in all of Kuwait. We have an excellent team that has driven the company's growth, strong market position, and upgraded rating. Our human capital is our most valuable asset.</p><h4>KIC offers general, travel, life, marine, and motor insurance. In which segments are you looking to expand in Kuwait?</h4><p>We are focusing on the personal lines. When compared to international markets, Kuwait and the rest of the Middle East lack the personal lines of life insurance and personal estate insurance. About 17% of personal spending in the US goes toward insurance. That figure is just 2% in Kuwait. The reason for this is that the government provides free education, healthcare, and greatly subsidizes housing. There is no perceived need for many kinds of insurance. There is also, however, a lack of insurance knowledge in the country and we are trying to build that up. We are investing in awareness, directly through KIC as well as through the Kuwait Insurance Federation. Hopefully the market can remedy this internal gap in society so that people can truly understand the value of insurance. Insurance is not just a way of receiving compensation; more importantly, insurance is a means for feeling safe, secure, and protected from risk.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand further in the Gulf?</h4><p>This is always an option for us, and whether we pursue it depends on the opportunities available. We had plans at one point to open branches in Egypt, which was then engulfed in turmoil shortly thereafter. Instability can be a problem when pursuing regional expansion. We also considered moving into other markets with major potential for growth. However, the conditions are not suitable right now. We will take our expertise to more markets abroad once we identify the right opportunity.</p><h4>How do you view KIC's reputation in the region?</h4><p>Many of the key individuals throughout the GCC's insurance companies are ex-KIC employees. From the 1970s until the 1980s, KIC was considered a school for insurers in the region. Several leaders in the insurance industry began here. Even when we closed some of our branches in the region, we did not need to redistribute our employees; they were sought after by other providers or else went on to start their own companies. Instead of competing with them, we pulled out and gave them support. KIC is proud of having strengthened the insurance sector not only in Kuwait, but also throughout the region.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We hope to continue our record of success. We know that there are projects to develop, opportunities to grow, premiums to write, and insurance to provide. Global markets are still intact and reinsurers are strong. The insurance markets are particularly stable in the region. The main concern is political stability in places like Syria and Iraq. These are difficult to predict, and such external risks of political strife and terrorism could impact our business. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is KIF working to raise the bar for the insurance industry in Kuwait?</h4><p>KIF came about in order to have an organization whereby industry professionals could discuss common issues internally, then present our proposals to government officials to resolve the problems we face. We were given the approval to form our federation about nine years ago, and we are now entering our third term. Most countries in the GCC region have an insurance federation. KIF does not necessarily constitute all the insurance companies in Kuwait, though this is something we want to work on. One of the weaknesses of the Federation is that membership is currently not compulsory, as it is for banks, whereby membership of an industry federation or union is imposed by the Central Bank of Kuwait. We play an advisory role, so we can not impose compulsory changes in operating procedures, which is another current limitation. We have been trying to mediate between insurance companies in order resolve their problems.</p><h4>What are the main issues facing the insurance industry in Kuwait?</h4><p>One of the major problems of the industry is the lack of proper regulation. Professionals in the insurance industry work according to their own professional guidelines. When we look to our neighbors, the insurance industry in Saudi Arabia is regulated by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), Bahrain is regulated by the Central Bank, and insurance regulation in Egypt is carried out by an independent regulator with full legal control to set and enforce policy. But in Kuwait, Insurance industry regulated through  a department in the Ministry of Commerce and this presents obvious administrative challenges. A second problem is that we still operate under an obsolete law enacted in 1961 that only regulates licensing procedures and minimum capital requirements. The insurance industry is self regulated to an extent, but there has been a recent increase in the number of licensed insurance companies, which has changed the playing field in the market. This increase in competition in the absence of a structured regulator has revealed many flaws in the legal structure of the sector. We also face the additional problem of a shortage of well qualified human resources in insurance.</p><h4>What is your opinion of the future of mandatory insurance in Kuwait?</h4><p>Insurance products are need-based, so interest in insurance policies generally does not exist where there is not a perceived need. Our government protects housing, education, and health for the entirety of Kuwaiti citizens' lives, which makes selling life insurance policies difficult in Kuwait. People here tend not to buy life insurance because there is not a perceived need for it, though companies still try. Kuwaiti citizens are also reluctant to purchase pensions because they already have such sophisticated pension plans provided by the government. The government recently tendered a $328 million retirement insurance program that will cover over 100,000 retirees in Kuwait. This will greatly increase the volume of premiums in the market. The government has already signaled that there would be more similar initiatives in the future if this project is successful.</p><h4>In what specific ways is KIF trying to influence government policy?</h4><p>We drafted and presented a law to the government proposing that there be an independent supervisory  regulator of the insurance industry in Kuwait, as is the case in other GCC countries. If our proposal is accepted, this regulatory body would be run by professionals who can regulate the market in a proper manner. With more players entering the insurance sector, we need to ensure that they operate in a more efficient and professional way. Legislation is an important instrument of change, and has recently started to recognize the value of the insurance sector, albeit tentatively. The government has started imposing professional liability requirements on certain professions before licensing them. We hope that this generalizing of insurance stipulations continues.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We are big believers in the value of investing in training. We train a lot through KIF and we also sponsor and subsidize additional training. Our focus in 2016 will be on training and education. If our proposed industry legislation is passed, a majority of the current problems will be resolved. If a new independent regulatory body can formally address questions of capital adequacy, reserve and rating requirements, the bar will be raised significantly in a newly reshaped insurance industry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the defining events in the evolution of Global since it was established in 1998?</h4><p>It's been somewhat of a rollercoaster ride for us. When we were established in 1998, when oil was at around $8. We shot up like a rocket during the first 10 years of our inception. We understood that the capital markets in Kuwait lacked certain products and services and we capitalized on that. We entered a boom market phase between 2002 and 2007, which gave us the headwind we needed to grow. We started Global with a capital of $50 million in 1998 and, by mid 2008, we were trading at a $5 billion market cap. We expanded our offices to cover Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt, Oman, and even had investments in Palestine. The financial crisis was the first real challenge for us and, as we witnessed, when the US sneezes, the whole world catches a cold. Asset liability management became a major challenge as well. We were only 1-to-1 leveraged at the time, but in less than 12 months we were leveraged at more than 12-to-1. We chose to be completely transparent with our clients, shareholders, and regulators throughout it all. This approach was unique in a culture that generally conceals problems, but we stuck to our commitment to being honest. I'm proud of what Global has done. With the restructuring agreement we signed in 2012, the company is now well capitalized, totally debt-free, and profitable. Dividends are being distributed and business is growing.</p><h4>As a leading Kuwait-based investment company, what role do you see Global playing in terms of improving the business environment and contributing to the local society in Kuwait?</h4><p>Our corporate social responsibility strategy focuses on two major segments; women and young people. Kuwait has always been a pioneer in supporting women and we at Global have a lot of women in senior positions. We have held a lot of seminars on women in investment, training, and promotion of women's empowerment. In complement to the national vision of Kuwait, we also feel strongly about the need to support the emergence of entrepreneurs and small businesses. We feel the frustration of young people in trying to fulfill their dreams. There is a lot we need to think about to support small enterprises. We are hoping that we can work with the Kuwait National Fund for SMEs Development, the $2 billion fund that has been created by the government to support young people.</p><h4>Kuwait is well known for its investment outflows, but in terms of attracting investors to Kuwait, what opportunities exist here and how can Kuwait create a more attractive environment for foreign investment?</h4><p>There are a lot of things we can do, especially with the recent reforms mentioned earlier. The retail market promises a lot of growth potential considering the demographics on the consumer-side, the strong inflow of expats, and the growing entrepreneurial spirit among SMEs in Kuwait contributing to the consumer goods and retail market in the country. There's a lot of potential in the healthcare and educational sectors, as well. These sectors still hold a lot of value for investors in Kuwait. Then of course everything related to oil and gas, petrochemicals, and alternative energy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Everything we talk about economically for 2016 hinges on what happens geopolitically, unfortunately. The developments with Iran may lead to further uncertainty in the region and markets don't expect a rise in oil prices to hit the $70-100 range, but will be somewhere between $30-50 a barrel. I hope GCC governments tackle the challenge that a reduction in oil prices will continue to have on their budget surpluses, and moving towards a budget deficit, which could be a potential for the GCC government and corporate debt market in meeting the fiscal spending and the development plans that the government continues to commit to in the coming few years. Over and above that, we will continue to offer ideas in defensive sectors such as health and education, among others. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about your investment expertise and the type of investing activities that Rasameel focuses on?</h4><p>We are licensed both for banking and investment banking. We do asset securitization, sukuk issuances, structuring, arrangement, placement, capital restructuring, and investment advisory. Our activities are largely focused on the debt-side of things—debt capital markets and debt instruments—rather than equity, and we are the only company in Kuwait that has such a specialization. Most investment companies in Kuwait do asset management and equity trading, but we are unique in our field.</p><h4>In 2014 and 2015, Rasameel was awarded Best Islamic Structured Finance House in the GCC. What makes the company a leader in its field?</h4><p>It is our focus and our specialization in being an Asset Structuring House that sets us apart. Banks lend their balance sheets and underwrite according to their lending and credit criteria. Our budget is about $330.8 million) which is relatively small when it comes to lending activity. Where we come into play is putting together structuring capability so our clients can respond without burdening their balance sheet. We do off balance sheet funding based on the strength and the quality of their assets and cash flow. Companies are used to going to banks and borrowing to create assets. We buy the assets off the balance sheets, creating equity for them so they can continue doing their business. We acquire portfolios of receivables and leases. We like income generating assets so we acquire them and sell them in the form of investment instruments that give annuity. That is the kind of different approach that we have at Rasameel compared to the rest of the market.</p><h4>What is your criteria when it comes to targeting the type of clients that you work with?</h4><p>We go after clients that have income generating assets, namely consumer asset companies, auto leasing companies, aviation, and companies that have long-term contracts of supply, such as contracts with the government over a period of three to five years. We can put financing packages around that stream of income because it is predictable. That is what we go after. Our investors on the other side are mainly institutional investors, sometime banks, and those who are looking for income generating assets rather than putting their money away and waiting for it grow. People aspiring to make huge gains would go for private equity, but our side of the business involves more calculated risk with manageable predictable yields in the range of 4-7%. Certain clients like to invest in such products because their capital is relatively secure and they have an identifiable source of income that will generate for a period of three months, six months, or a year. They like to play it safe.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in the sukuk market?</h4><p>Mainly for consumer financing companies because they have an ongoing need for funding. They are willing to do Mudharabah sukuk and Musharakah sukuk. There is a growing trend for Green sukuks, sukuks that go into funding environmental friendly projects, which is basically directing funding towards an ethical part of the economy. It falls under the same structure as either Wadiah, Musharakah, Leasing, or Mudaraba. Our commercial paper program for Alghanim which won an award for innovation. We then bought on their behalf on a third party basis, and they deferred all their sales to our account with a yield up to a certain limit. Anything over and above was their profit. They made a huge profit without having to commit their capital. For the investors, they were happy to see the cash coming in and the short-term nature of the transaction for the client. They were happy to see an increase in sales and notwithstanding that, they were getting a substantial amount of profit at the back end, because we only took 7% and the balance was for their account. It is win-win, for the client, for the investors, and for us. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your investment philosophy at Gatehouse?</h4><p>We call ourselves a merchant bank, meaning that we are partners with our clients. Our investment philosophy is focused on the needs of clients in this region. Historically, they have invested with big, well-known investment banks, but these firms have been going through strategic changes. Additionally, the regulatory environment has evolved which has impacted the industry. We realized many Gulf-based firms were employing an ineffective model, namely that having someone in an office who has never known a market, structuring a product, and having relationship managers selling that product without understanding it was not working. I wanted to have people on the ground defining what we and our clients want and need.</p><h4>What are some of the recent successes you have had at Gatehouse?</h4><p>Coming out of the financial crisis, we were deploying capital across a range of single tenant, income-producing assets when many were too afraid to invest. We employed this strategy in the US and the UK where we saw increased economic growth and corporate balance sheets improving. This had a positive effect on both the office and industrial real estate markets, among others. Today, our thesis has proved correct as we have successfully exited a number of these investments. In student housing, which today is a very popular asset class with institutions, we were among the first to enter the sector in the UK and the US. We then looked at single-family residential assets in the US. Many of these assets were held by banks due to the mortgage crisis. Due to the valuations we were seeing, combined with our view towards economic, job, and rent growth, we became heavily involved the sector during 2013-14 period. Today, we own approximately 1,800 homes across multiple growth markets; these assets are providing strong current income for our investors. Building upon this, we looked for similar opportunities in the UK. While the private rented market differs in the UK relative to the US, we saw that there was a significant supply-demand imbalance in the UK market.</p><h4>Kuwait, through its sovereign wealth fund, investment companies, and the investments of private individuals, is known as the leader in the region in terms of investment outflows. What do you think is needed in order to bring some of this investment into Kuwait?</h4><p>What it comes down to is the rule of law. We choose the US and the UK for our investment activities because we can define and understand what our legal rights are in those jurisdictions. Global investors need clear local laws and transparency. An investor does not want to be in a market where they may run into problems if they want to liquidate assets or move money. That being said, Kuwait is a sophisticated market in terms of liquidity and has the potential to be a leading frontier market with global exposure. However, another challenge is that Kuwaitis tend to feel that they should be the ones investing in their country. This is different from the attitude in other GCC states where they are heavily promoting foreign capital investment. If there is a project in Kuwait that global companies want to fund or be part of, Kuwaiti companies tend to want to do it themselves. This is a cultural mentality, and I do not blame local companies for seizing these opportunities when they have the liquidity. In recent years, Kuwait has been trying to encourage more foreign investment by introducing new foreign capital regulations and tax incentives. Kuwait needs to be more welcoming and clearer from a legal perspective and also refine the bureaucratic process to get things done. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Markaz's focus today as a leading financial institution in the region?</h4><p>We manage investment products in the form of equities or real estate, monitoring opportunities emanating primarily from this region. We also invest for diversification purposes. On the investment banking side, we are active in capital markets, IT, and helping companies ease long-term funding needs in the form of equity, sukuk, or bonds. We believe in the importance of having a healthy asset management industry as a source of alternative funding because it helps intermediation. In this region, there is a high level of deposits, both institutional and private, and it is necessary to find opportunities to help deploy those deposits. The fund management and asset management industry is part of the mechanism that helps manage this objective. Our business model relies on two pillars, the first being investment returns out of our exposure on the stock market. The second pillar is investment fees. We generate fees that have to do with our efforts in terms of preparing opportunities, packaging them, researching them, managing them, and helping them fulfill their objectives. We are one of the top ten GCC mutual fund managers. The stock markets are important to us but, more importantly, they represent the underlying economies of the GCC.</p><h4>What is your analysis of the impact low oil prices has had on Kuwait and regional economies?</h4><p>Falling oil prices prepare us for an interesting, more diversified economic era. It is an opportunity to bring out the best in Kuwait. Oil was undeniably crucial for the development of Kuwait and allowed the state to live in a regime of strong surpluses for a very long time, but it also led to inefficiencies. Sometimes it has created a sense of complacency, unfortunately, and I think oil prices going down will help eradicate that. It is an opportunity to look more seriously at the private sector's role in creating jobs.</p><h4>What role is Markaz playing in the effort to grow the private sector in Kuwait?</h4><p>Throughout the years, Markaz pioneered the development of investment tools in local and new markets. Markaz has succeeded year after year in developing new concepts and innovations through the creation of new investment channels, each with unique characteristics, in order to widen investors' horizons by diversify investment channels. And As part of our economic responsibility, we were the first to publish research with the aim of providing in-depth knowledge to the financial sector; in fact, a whole department was dedicated to research publication. Furthermore, Markaz cooperates with numerous academics and international research foundations to develop economic policy research in fields such as the energy sector, the labor market, economic structure, and the enhancement of the public institution performance to support a healthy private sector growth. Markaz distributes its public policy reports to decision makers and other stakeholders in Kuwait, and results are discussed with them to reach practical solutions.</p><h4>Markaz is known to be a socially engaged corporation. What is your approach to CSR?</h4><p>We believe in being strongly engaged in public welfare as a corporation, which led us to develop our own concept of CSR, which we call Corporate Economic Responsibility, where our engagement strategy focuses on contributing to three areas, namely: human development, ease of doing business, and good governance. We are active members of the Kuwaiti Economic Society, which is massively advocating a wide-scale reform of the public sector in terms of holding people accountable, assuring that when more areas of the economy are privatized, it is going to be a straightforward, transparent, and clean process.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Because we are living in volatile times, especially this year, it is hard to have full clarity on a long-term vision. We aim to achieve a growth in our net earnings of at least 15% in 2015. One of the most pressing trends or reforms we need to have in the near future is to catch up with our neighbors and join the MSCI emerging market index. Kuwait is more than another frontier market and needs to be in the emerging market index. S&amp;P just added the UAE and Qatar, and Kuwait should be officially announced by our CMA soon. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>KAMCO's strategy aims at maintaining its leadership position in the asset management and investment banking sectors. What trends have you seen dominating your investment performance in recent years?</h4><p>After 2013, KAMCO emerged from a difficult period following the financial crisis. We undertook significant restructuring and focused on building our core business areas: asset management and investment banking. We returned to profitability in 2013 and started achieving several key objectives and set milestones. The markets also supported us in their upwards tends. The key geographical focus areas for our clients were the MENA region including Kuwait, the GCC, as well as other targeted parts of the region. Several of our clients are increasingly observing Europe, North America, and the Far East, but remain cautious and highly selective. The 1H2014 was also positive, while the second was more volatile due to a loss of investor confidence stemming from the drop in oil prices and increasing geopolitical instability, reasons that continue to affect markets to date. Despite numerous positive indicators, especially in the GCC, we note that capital market activity remains volatile, leading to a downward trend. This has affected the investment sector and KAMCO in our capital markets business. However, we successfully launched a new fixed-income fund in March 2015 focused on MENA region investment grade bonds and sukuks. KAMCO posted $16.87 million in Fee Income in 2014 compared to $17.53 million in 2013. The company reduced its debts by 17% to $79.4 million in 2014 compared to $95.94 million in 2013. Our AUM registered a significant growth of 23% in 2014 to $12.2 billion in 2014, compared to $10.1 billion in 2013. KAMCO's results during 2014 reflected the company's balanced and consistent performance at the operating income level in our main activities. By the end of 2014, we had successfully completed over 82 cumulative investment-banking transactions worth over $12 billion.</p><h4>Who are your target clients and how are you tailoring your investment products to their needs?</h4><p>We believe that by creating products that give investors market access at lower costs with proper management and appropriate risk measures, we can benefit from tapping into the significant liquidity that is already there with medium to high-net worth individuals and corporates, as well as sovereign and semi-sovereign investing entities in the region. The product cycle we launched, and are continually developing, primarily focuses on such clients.</p><h4>To what extent has the new phase of privatization in Kuwait's capital markets supported the country's transition from frontier to emerging market status?</h4><p>Kuwait has been actively pursuing this strategy through significant upgrades in the regulatory framework and improvements in the laws that allow companies to be established or privatized under a new private-public sector framework. Processes such as these take time and issues related to fine-tuning regulations and making sure people adapt to and abide by the new codes of corporate governance and ethics may delay development. The government is taking the necessary steps to expedite this process. Unfortunately, market conditions are bearish in general, which appear to be affected by the regulations, but in reality they may show some kind of reaction as people adjust, it is more about a lack of investor confidence than anything else. Some of the initiatives taken recently by the CMA were aimed at encouraging investment, building investors trust, increasing the capital and encouraging creativity among investment companies.</p><h4>In the context of Kuwait's growing economy and with major government development plans in place, what role do you see KAMCO playing in Kuwait's future growth?</h4><p>We believe that the government plans will produce a strong trickle down effect to the private sector and will further allow businesses to focus on efficiency and the enhanced delivery of products and services. To kick-start an economic revival, the government approved a new five-year development plan for Kuwait, which envisages spending $112.9 billion on development projects in the years of 2015/2016-19/2020. The plan is part of Kuwait's long-term vision of becoming a regional trade and financial hub. It includes projects like the construction of a metro system, a railway network and a large number of mega oil projects, along with a new refinery. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were AIC's main objectives upon its establishment in Kuwait in 2006, and how has the company's investment strategy evolved over the years?</h4><p>AIC was initially intended as a traditional investment services company, catering for unconnected parties. This purpose was further rethought by AIC's President and other members of the Bukhamseen Group Holding; therefore, entrusting the company with the additional principal objective of becoming the investment arm of the Bukhamseen Holding Group. To that end, the Group's investment activities, then spread across its holdings, became centralized under AIC. Furthermore, members of the family became AIC's shareholders, as the best way for preserving the Group's interest. Clearly, our investment strategy changes according to market developments, but is always based on high-efficiency plans and the safeguard of invested principal. We generally avoid speculation, and rather focus on robust assets with strong fundamentals in specific promising sectors. To date, AIC is operating as a knowledge-based, growth-oriented investment company with the main task of securing the integrity of invested assets and achieving profitability of investments. Currently, it is a boutique investment firm, with sizeable assets under management. Its clients' base encompasses a large number of companies representing several sectors and high net worth individuals. Earning clients' trust was, and still is, AIC's first priority.</p><h4>What type of clientele does AIC normally work with, and what type of investor would benefit from your expertise?</h4><p>Primarily, AIC clients are our family members; investing with us either in their personal capacity or on behalf of the companies they are heading within the Group. We also service a broad base of corporate entities and high-net-worth individuals. AIC is a boutique investment services company, whose main attributes are to be knowledge based and growth oriented. Its clients are market knowledgeable investors who go by merit-based decisions.</p><h4>What role do you envisage AIC playing in Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>Since its establishment, it has been imperative for AIC to maintain a strong presence by building up confidence so as to be able to do more for the economy in Kuwait. Looking forward, our role in Kuwait's economic future will stem from our typical mission as an investment company. Our services encompass advising and assisting companies and individuals in market transactions and corporate development. Worth noting is that our corporate finance services always represent a substantial part of our core activities. Our services in this regard encompass mergers and acquisitions, divestures, business valuations and feasibility studies, due diligence, investment review and fairness opinion, capital raising, financial restructuring, and so on, therefore resulting in stronger companies in the State of Kuwait. Added to this is AIC's participation in local and cross-border markets, both at its own corporate level, and on behalf of its clients. We shall continue strengthening our position in local and international markets in what best serves the Kuwaiti economy. It is through these undertakings that AIC plans a wider participation in Kuwait's economic future.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for growth in the GCC region?</h4><p>There are some countries that we seek to invest in and believe are poised for a great future. On the other hand, we seek to divest our positions in other countries where opportunities for gain have eroded. Between both extremes, there are countries where we decided to hold our investment as we foresee an impending market rebound. There are positives to working in GCC countries. In general, our preferences change depending on the sector and the country. In the UAE, we prefer working as a local investor in sectors such as insurance, hospitality, and real estate. In other places, we prefer to be invested in diversified and well-managed companies. Saudi Arabia is a good country to do business in, because of the size of the population, and the presence of economies of scale. We also favor Oman and are studying investment opportunities there. Expanding outside of the GCC, we are looking at Egypt and Turkey. As for Iraq, it is a big market, but still has many unsolved issues.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We anticipate fewer challenges than in the past few years. We also tend to believe that it will be a very busy year. We will be engaged in building up liquidity, and bringing growth into effective action, namely expanding our presence by opening new markets at the regional level, and increasing our scope of activities, with particular emphasis on generating innovative collective investment schemes. On the macro level, following the legislative approval earlier in 2015 of the broad investment plan for the coming five years (2015-20), as well as the 2015-16 capital spending budget rising notably, it is expected that a solid pace of growth will be driven and supported by public spending. This will pave the way for companies such as AIC to profitably apply their capabilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>BKSC was established in 2014 as part of the privatization plan for the Kuwait Stock Exchange (KSE). What were the reasons for establishment? </h4><p>KSE was founded as a self-regulatory entity in 1983 and operated as such until the promulgation of the Capital Markets Law in 2010, which brought about the formal establishment of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) as the regulatory body for all securities activities in Kuwait. In recent years, KSE has trailed its regional peers and has witnessed a decline in liquidity exceeding 80% in the last 10 years and while the Dubai Financial Market (DFM) index, for example, has recorded growth of nearly 170% in the last five years, the KSE index has increased by only 5.5%. Privatization would also shield the stock exchange from government interference in operations and management and allow for a separation between shareholders, management and traders. This brings us to BKSC. The company was established in April 2014 with an authorized capital of KWD60 million ($198.5 million) by the Capital Markets Authority Commissioners' Council resolution 37/2013 and the preamble to law 7/2010. Our current goal is to assume administrative control of the KSE and to begin a 46-step strategic transformation plan that we have devised with input from all stakeholders to improve the exchange's current performance, turning it into a leading regional market. It is important to note here that law 7/2010 also outlined the ownership structure of the exchange, dictating the sale of 50% of the exchange to Kuwaiti citizens in an IPO, a percentage not less than 6% and not more than 24% to be allocated to government bodies and a percentage not more than 44% and not less than 26% to be auctioned to an international operator.</p><h4>How will the privatization of the KSE impact the financial market in Kuwait and what does it signify about the transition occurring in Kuwait's economy?</h4><p>The privatization of the KSE is pending the enactment of law 22/2015 in November 2015. This law amends certain articles of law 7/2010, including article 156, which grants the CMA the right to appoint BKSC to manage and operate the KSE during the transition period. This will last until the finalization of the privatization process as stipulated by article 33 of the same law. However, the change in legislation signifies that Kuwait is on a path of much-needed economic diversification, which was made all the more obvious by the recent decline in oil prices over the last year. There is value in the non-oil private sector that needs supporting legislature to allow it to reach its full potential, and that is what we are seeing now with the move to privatize the KSE. Additionally, the public sector in Kuwait is quite large, accounting for 70% of GDP and employs nearly 80% of the total Kuwaiti workforce. Public sector salaries in 2014 amounted to nearly 19% of Kuwait's GDP ($181 billion)—quite a staggering figure. The government is gradually reducing its role as an operator and focusing on being a regulator. The approval of a $116 billion development strategy for 2015-20 will see an increased role of the private sector from its current 26.4% to more than 40% and the positioning of Kuwait as a financial hub. A successful example from the region of a privatized exchange is the DFM, which was established in 2000 as a public institution and was transformed into a public joint stock company in 2005. Liquidity on the DFM jumped from 12.69% in 2005 to 158.5% in 2007, two years after its privatization. Market capitalization increased from $86.9 billion in 2005 to $138.2 billion in 2006.</p><h4>Where does the KSE stand today, with regards to investor best practice standards, and where would you like it to be in the future?</h4><p>KSE is getting a new lease on life. Although it is one of the oldest stock exchanges in the Gulf, it has been recording gradual declines in liquidity over the last 10 years from a high of KWD33.9 billion ($112 billion) in total value traded in 2007 to a record 10-year low of KWD5.9 billion ($19.52 billion) in 2014. This has partly been due to the lack of products meeting international standards and outdated infrastructure amidst growing investor requirements. As a result, the KSE today trails behind other stock exchanges in the Gulf in several metrics including value traded as a percentage of market capitalization, which dropped from 37% in 2007 to 19% in 2014 and value traded as a percentage of GDP—a metric that reflects the stock market's health versus the health of its domestic business environment. Between 2010 and 2014 alone, the KSE's value traded as a percentage of GDP dropped from 36% to 11% while all other regional markets registered positive growth rates (some as high as 2.5 times). </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the activities of the CMA evolved since the inception of the authority in 2010?</h4><p>The initial four years were challenging for the authority. The CMA came in to regulate a market that had been in place for at least 30 years since the establishment of Kuwait Stock Exchange. That role was previously given to a Market Committee headed by the Minister of Trade and Commerce, which did not reflect proper governance or match best global market practices. The CMA has separated the regulator from the market itself. Over the last four years, the CMA has been busy issuing the by-laws, building capacity and organizational structure, and recruiting young talented Kuwaitis to serve within the CMA. It takes time for a regulator to really see the full picture based on what the law has actually asked the market to do. Moving into our second four-year term, we started by amending 65 articles out of the 164 in the original law passed by the national assembly. These amendments have given the CMA the strength the power and the tools to meet international standards. We have very challenging tasks ahead. One of the most important tasks is joining the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO). The second is to upgrade the Kuwaiti market to emerging market status. This will be very important for the economy and the market and will reflect the long and deep history of the Kuwait Stock Exchange and trading within the country. We are putting all of our efforts and resources forward to make sure that the market will be upgraded; this is our target.</p><h4>What have been some of the major changes in regulations of the stock market over the past year relative to foreign investors?</h4><p>With the new amendments to the law published in May 2015, the Kuwait Stock Exchange has been privatized. The Kuwait Bourse Company has been established—a first for the Kuwaiti economy. This opens the door for foreign international operators to have a stake of up to 44%. This will serve our interests in upgrading the market by bringing the best know-how into Kuwait and inviting partnerships with the most reputable international operators. We want to encourage foreign investors to come and to stay in Kuwait. By offering up to 44%, we hope international operators will have the incentive to run companies here long term. Second, the new amendment has exempted foreign investors from any taxes; dividends will have no tax nor will there be a capital gains tax. These two factors are addressing our target to promote the market to international investors.</p><h4>From a regulatory perspective, what is the difference between a conventional bond and a sukuk bond, and how can a company become eligible to issue a sukuk?</h4><p>We are working on this issue on two parallel fronts. We are in the final stage of issuing the bonds as well as sukuk regulations. Because they are different products, there is a market for each. Bonds are like any other fixed income product in any other market, while sukuk is subject to sharia principles. However, there are also differences within the sharia principles based on the sharia advisory boards. To come up with a benchmark, we have our own sharia advisory board within the CMA. The proposal for the sukuk has been sent to the board to get their final approval. By the end of 2015 it seems we will be able to issue the bond regulations. Having said that, there will be no effective market for the bonds, nor will there be an effective debt market if we cannot encourage the government to issue sovereign bonds, so we are encouraging them to do so.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the CMA in 2016?</h4><p>By 2016 we would like to have the corporate governance code finalized, as well as the bonds and sukuk regulations, and the market maker regulations. We would like to enter 2016 by upgrading the financial brokerage firms that are working in Kuwait to international standards. They have been asked to raise their capital to 10 million by the end of 2016. We plan to restructure the post trade model as well. We would like to see the newly created Kuwait Bourse Company start taking the lead and running their stock exchange. Lastly, we would like to become members of IOSCO and begin dialogs with international organizations to form strategic partnerships in terms of training and capacity building for the CMA. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your analysis of the growth potential in Islamic banking for Boubyan?</h4><p>Growth and demand in the Islamic economy is very high—40% of Kuwaiti banking assets are Islamic—and this is an industry that was just getting started 35 years ago. Looking at Kuwait's demographics, we estimate that 15-20% of the population are interested in dealing with Islamic banks “exclusively“ due to religious reasons, while the remaining customers might consider their bank of choice based on the quality and diversification of the services provided and products offered. As a result, we believe that by providing top-notch services our Islamic bank will present itself as a very attractive option, and that customers are smart enough to choose the option that serves them best. We certainly know that customers will never sacrifice quality of service, products, or innovation only for products to be merely branded as “Islamic,“ and this is why we spare no effort in trying to outperform our competition as well. Our strategy is to target Kuwaitis, especially young ones, as well as affluent expatriates, by differentiating ourselves from other banks in terms of services and technology. Islamic banking is a growing segment, but the pie is shrinking, especially in the Kuwaiti market, making it very  competitive to operate here.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in international banking, and do you see the current political climate clashing with the growth of Islamic finance worldwide?</h4><p>We already have a presence in the UK, where we hold a 25.62% stake in Bank of London, and the Middle East, and similarly we are in East Asia considering that we hold a 22% stake in Bank Muamalat Indonesia. We know that our customers' aspirations go beyond that, and we are exploring overseas expansion opportunities as a part of our strategy. This is a longer-term plan, owing to the political uncertainty around the world at present, which has even led some international banks to pull back from certain markets. Meanwhile, I do expect that Islamic banks will be affected, too, but I believe that such an effect will in no way be similar to that suffered by global banks. This is mainly attributed to the special nature of Islamic banks and their exclusivity being the one and only destination for a specific segment of Muslims who only seek sharia-compliant banking services. While controlling $2 trillion worth of assets, Islamic banks also have a huge customer-base, but some are looking at taking Islamic banking to Europe while there is still potential growth in Muslim countries. For example, in Kuwait Islamic banking accounts for 39% and in Dubai it is not more than 30%. Also, there are unseized opportunities in Indonesia, a Muslim country with a population of 250 million Muslims where Islamic banking accounts only for 5%, and Egypt, a Muslim country with a population of around 100 million and a lack of Islamic banking. Egypt is one of the Muslim countries subject to our 2020 Strategy that aims at overseas expansion to position the bank and Islamic banking as an attractive and modern option for young people in such markets.</p><h4>What are your targets for Boubyan Bank moving forward?</h4><p>We are looking at 20% growth YoY, at least for the next five years. We have been achieving this growth for the past five years and think we can carry it on for five more years. Our goal for 2020 is to be the third top bank in Kuwait. Six years ago, we planned to place ourselves as one of the best Islamic banks in Kuwait, but now the sky is the limit for our aspirations, and we are not only planning to be among the top three banks in Kuwait but also to be among the top 20 Islamic banks in the world. We think Islamic banks should invest more in productive sectors, such as the agricultural or industrial sectors, where investments are secure and not dependent on speculation. It is time now to come up with banking products that chime with the soul of Islamic banking, for example profit sharing instead of lending. We are looking forward to partnering with customers and sharing profits with them and this is quite possible under Islamic banking which is more asset-oriented. Partnerships and profit-sharing are much higher risk because the same logically entails loss-sharing as well, so Islamic banks should have the right tools in place to mitigate such hazards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the performance of Burgan Bank over 2014 and into 2015?</h4><p>The performance of the bank has been consistently solid, like most other banks in Kuwait; however, our model is different as we are the most international Kuwaiti bank. Firstly, we have the largest relative international presence compared to others, because in terms of our expansion strategy we decided to diversify out of Kuwait into faster growth markets. At the same time, diversification has to do with risk management. The more diversified you are, your ability to endure and keep growing becomes more solid. Secondly, we have a focus on quality earnings. We are not an organization that is based on one-off large gains or deals. Thirdly, we are truly customer-centric.</p><h4>How would you describe the health of Kuwait's banking sector?</h4><p>The health of the market, like many other conditions, has several variables. If you think in terms of solvency and the strength of the system, the Kuwaiti banking system is one of the strongest in the world, by the players that are here as well as by the support given by a strong government. This is also backed up by the fact that the Central Bank, by law, backs 100% of the deposits, irrespective of the amounts. We could benefit from evolution because the market relies on the strength of the government, which could still bail everyone out in extreme conditions. We do not run the bank like this, but strive to be innovative and support our customers in Kuwait and abroad. </p><h4>What are you doing to facilitate international banking in Kuwait?</h4><p>In reality, being customer-centric means that we are building around the success of our customers. We are helping customers do things outside of their environments, as well as serving customers in other jurisdictions. In order to help Kuwait to grow—and this is a country that has unbelievable possibilities due to some competitive advantages—someone has to occupy the space of being the conduit of helping our customers here to be successful elsewhere in the world. We are not the only ones, but right now we have the largest footprint out of Kuwait. We have a competitive edge to build on, and our code of behavior is also solid.</p><h4>What growth opportunities are you looking into outside of Kuwait?</h4><p>There are three markets in the region that are interesting to us as we have publically announced, and we will eventually go there, one way or another, with the right set up. One is Egypt, there is also Saudi Arabia and the UAE. I look at the Emirates with enormous respect. It has been successful and has done a number of things very well. Our customers are interested in doing business there, and we are helping them do that. We have recently obtained some licenses to operate in the DIFC. I do not believe we will enter the retail banking sphere in UAE, because it is an over-banked environment; however, you cannot be successful in this part of the world if you don't have a successful operation there. Also, our customers give indicators of what they want. We don't always need to have a physical presence to be operational, but if we have a presence in more than 15 other countries, that gives us a platform.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Burgan Bank in 2016?</h4><p>The penetration of Basel III has significantly affected the banking system around the world, particularly in Kuwait, which has been conservative. It has implications in terms of returns, for example, that have to be considered. Basel III was implemented in 2014, and we had to adjust our capital structure to comply with the new requirements. We did so by issuing some of the first instruments in Kuwait and the region. It is now about continuing the buildup that we have, as our core strategy and consolidating the recent acquisitions we have done. We have several projects in the pipeline, and we have to manage our risk profile carefully. We are profitable because we know how to operate in this environment. We have to preserve our ability to adjust and evolve. That is absolutely critical. In the end, we cannot be successful in environments like this if we are only doing well during expansionary cycles. Our model is agile and resilient. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As you were appointed Group CEO of KFH in October 2014, what have been some of the key elements of your executive strategy thus far?</h4><p>The board of directors would like to see improvements in efficiency, customer service, and achieve a better integration of the group as a whole. The key focuses were to align all the businesses that KFH owns, making sure that they add value to the KFH bank and provide significant, sustainable revenue to the group. We continue to look at ways of unloading assets that are speculative in nature or not core to our business lines and improve our asset quality by getting rid of heavy risk-weighted assets. This is one method that we use to give us room for our capital to support future growth. Beside our core competencies of real estate and financing, we are in many businesses in many areas such as energy, healthcare, human resources, and IT.</p><h4>KFH is one of the leaders in Islamic finance worldwide. What is your assessment of the development occurring internationally in the Islamic finance space?</h4><p>The development in Islamic banking products on the liability side has reached a level that is comparable to conventional banking but we have not yet reached the same level of product diversity on the assets side. The financing vehicles that are available on the Islamic side could see further improvement. We have seen a significant amount of sukuks outstanding because of their acceptability by the issuers and by governments. We've seen the government of South Africa, for example, issue sukuks because it can access the market and get the right type of funding with the right price. Investors whose confidence was shaken after the 2008 financial crisis feel more comfortable dealing with sukuks because they are asset based. Borrowers are willing to provide asset-based collateral for the sukuk instruments and thus both the issuer and the investor are happy. We are working to introduce more products on the asset side to a level where we are comparable to conventional bank.</p><h4>Focusing on Kuwait, how do you view your role in raising the bar of banking technology and improving efficiency in the Kuwaiti banking sector?</h4><p>We need to invest heavily in technology that provides a positive user experience in order for KFH, and all Kuwaiti banks, to operate more efficiently. If we can automate the transactions that currently go through call centers or physical branches and make products available in a self-service, user-friendly manner, more people would migrate to those channels and this would significantly decrease our operating cost base. It is a win-win model: better service for the clients and cheaper for the banks. KFH is the leader in online banking across all Kuwaiti banks with an excess of over 250,000 active online banking users. We are looking for payments to be easier with the likes of Apple Pay or Google Wallet, whereby you are replacing your credit card with the mobile phone, or facial recognition technologies whereby you make a payment based on your features or other biometrics such as fingerprint, palm print, voice recognition, or iris recognition. If these potential technologies are developed well enough, we want to be the first to adopt them. We recently rolled out an idea during Ramadan whereby customers could donate to Zakat Al-Fitr at KFH ATMs. We received an amazing amount of appreciation from customers thanking us for making it easy to donate simply with the click of a button. It was very positive and we are continuing to evolve in this manner.</p><h4>How have you seen the Basel III regulations impact KFH and the banking sector as a whole in Kuwait?</h4><p>Basel III had a significant impact on all Kuwaiti banks, specifically on KFH and NBK. Due to our size, regulators could potentially impose a premium for us over and above the thresholds set by Basel III of 15% in order for us to sustain future growth. This puts us at a disadvantage because at every loan, we weigh risks to assess the minimum equity or capital we need to finance it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Promise of Islamic Finance]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[promise-of-islamic-finance]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>We at the IMF are keen to participate, listen, collaborate, innovate, and develop the promise of Islamic finance in a sound and sustainable way, by managing risks appropriately and ensuring financial stability. We should recall what promise Islamic finance holds—to foster inclusive growth and support the livelihood and aspirations of the people in the region and beyond. And we know, inclusion is key to promote invigorating, reinforcing growth and shared prosperity.</p><p>While Islamic Finance is not new and has been practiced for centuries around the world, it has gained in popularity of late. Total Islamic finance assets are estimated at around $2 trillion, practically a ten-fold increase from a decade ago, and outperforming the growth of conventional finance in many places. Islamic finance has the potential to contribute to higher and more inclusive economic growth by increasing access of banking services to underserved populations. To this day, a large segment of the Muslim population—who are a primary, but not the only, market for Islamic finance around the world—remain financially underserviced, with only one-quarter of adults having access to bank accounts. In addition, Islamic finance's risk-sharing features and the strong link of credit to collateral means that it is well-suited for SMEs and startup financing—which we know can promote inclusive growth. For the same reason, Islamic finance has shown its value in infrastructure investment, which can spark productivity gains and catalyze high value-added growth.</p><p>Secondly, Islamic finance has, in principle, the potential to promote financial stability because its risk-sharing feature reduces leverage and its financing is asset-backed and thus fully collateralized. In addition, besides deposits, Islamic banks offer profit-sharing and loss-bearing accounts that can help mitigate losses and contagion in the event of banking sector distress. This leads, de facto, to higher total loss-absorbing capital, one of the key objectives of the new global regulatory reform.</p><p>To unlock the full potential of Islamic finance, the first priority is to level the playing field and create an enabling environment for Islamic finance to develop, while being mindful of risks. This means adapting financial regulations that take into account the defining features of Islamic finance and do not disadvantage Islamic banks. For example, capital requirements for banks should be adapted to account for Islamic finance's risk-and-profit sharing model—which allows for some loss-bearing by investors and reduces risk weights applied to equity-like financing.</p><p>Leveling the playing field also means harmonizing the tax treatment of Islamic finance products with similar conventional contracts. Income tax systems typically recognize interest gains on debt instruments as a deductible expense. This debt bias puts Islamic finance at a competitive disadvantage and discourages risk-shared financing. </p><p>The second priority for policymakers is to further develop the industry and markets. Many countries could encourage further improvements in Islamic banking to boost financing for small- and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>In addition to strengthening the industry, many countries could further develop Islamic financial markets. Think of the growth potential of sukuk. Over the past decade, total outstanding sukuk assets have seen a ten-fold increase to about $300 billion. Most of these assets remain concentrated in the Gulf states and Malaysia. But interest has been growing in other parts of the world. Luxembourg, Hong Kong, South Africa, and the UK are among a growing number of other countries that have issued sukuk bonds in recent years.<br>More regular sovereign issuance is needed at different maturities to help establish benchmarks and develop secondary markets. Sovereign sukuk plans need to be embedded in governments' debt management strategies. And the market needs to be supported by strong legal and regulatory frameworks. The latter would help address persistent uncertainty over investors' rights.</p><p>From the IMF's perspective, we are also looking to raise our game. As you know, financial stability lies at the heart of the IMF's work. We have, over the past year, done a large amount of analytical work to deepen our understanding of Islamic finance's implications for financial stability and economic growth. We are keen to pursue this agenda and to further strengthen our policy advice by incorporating best practices for Islamic banking and finance Together, we can foster a 21st-century version of Islamic finance that can deliver on all its promises. That is to promote financial inclusion and stability, meet the needs of financially underserved populations, lift potential growth, and create better opportunities of all people. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>One of KBA's goals is to boost cooperation among local banks. What does the organization do to achieve synergy among banks in the country?</h4><p>At present, all banks are members of the KBA. By default, any newly established bank or branch of a foreign bank opens in Kuwait will become a member. To ensure the effective cooperation of banks in discussing and following up issues of interest, KBA has a number of specialized committees in all areas of concern, and all banks are members of these committees. These committees are to meet regularly to address pressing issues and suggest appropriate ways to deal with them. This system has proved to be effective in enhancing cooperation among members of KBA.</p><h4>Global interest in Kuwait continues to rise, driven by the strong performance of Kuwait's banks in recent years. What have been some of the key, recent developments in Kuwait's banking sector, in terms of policy, that have improved the operating environment?</h4><p>The CBK has continued to strengthen regulation and supervision of the banking system to safeguard financial stability. The CBK operates a strict system of monitoring to ensure the viability of banks and shield the banking sector from undesirable shocks. By applying macro-prudential tools, the CBK is proactively monitoring and mitigating banking sector risks. By approving the implementation of the instructions of Basel III capital adequacy standards in June 2014, the leverage ratio standard in October 2014, and instructions on liquidity coverage ratio in December 2014, the CBK completed the implementation of the financial standards of the Basel III reform package. Kuwait has become one of the leading countries to implement these standards, adopted in the aftermath of the global financial crisis in order to consolidate the pillars of financial stability. The Kuwaiti banking sector has a capital adequacy ratio of 16.9% according to the Basel III definition. Continued efforts to develop money and debt markets will further strengthen liquidity management and improve monetary transmission.</p><h4>What are some common issues that banks are currently facing in Kuwait, and how is the KBA working to address these issues?</h4><p>The main issue currently facing banks is the full application of Basil III. KBA is coordinating with banks with the assistance of the CBK to fulfill their obligations according to Basil III by 2018. Kuwait is currently developing the SME sector. As a promising sector for attracting young entrepreneurs and providing jobs for Kuwaiti new comers to the labor market, KBA is coordinating between banks and the National Fund for developing SMEs for effective involvement of banks in co-financing SMEs with the National Fund. Funding agreements have already been signed between the National Fund and some national banks.</p><h4>Kuwait's economy is facing new challenges with the recent drastic drop in oil prices. What are the main challenges and opportunities at this crucial point in the country's development?</h4><p>There is no doubt that the most important challenge facing Kuwait now is the recent drop in oil prices. For the first time since the 1999/2000 fiscal year, the state budget scores a deficit estimated to be KWD8.2 billion (approximately $28 billion). Current scenarios also indicate that oil prices will continue to be low at least for the medium term in the future. Surely, the declining oil prices are expected to have negative effects on the private sector in Kuwait. This is because public spending is the main driver of economic activity in the state. The decline in public spending is expected to cause lower rates of economic growth, which has already been expected by international economic institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. From that perspective, we expect the growth of banking services to decline.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the banking sector in 2016?</h4><p>Economic conditions in 2016 will be to some extent different from those that prevailed in 2015. We expect oil prices to continue to be lower than their trend. Lower oil prices will also mean lower per capita income and private savings. Of course, all of these factors will have a negative impact on the banking sector. This will be countered by opening the door for banks to provide necessary credit for the government to finance the budget deficit. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does KPI play in the international strategy for Kuwait's oil?</h4><p>Within the K-companies under the umbrella of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC), KPI is classified as the international arm for KPC for downstream business. KPC's structure contains both local and international downstream and upstream operations. The downstream business in Kuwait is under the charge of Kuwait National Petroleum Company (KNPC), which takes care of the refining business in Kuwait, as well as gas operations, and also domestic marketing. In the upstream, we have Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Kuwait Gulf Oil Company (KGOC). Outside Kuwait, we have two companies, KPI and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (KUFPEC). KUFPEC mainly deals with the upstream production side, gas operations, and production, and KPI deals with the downstream business, mainly refining and marketing operations. We also have Petrochemicals Industries Company (PIC), which deals with petrochemicals inside and outside of Kuwait, but PIC will join KPI to do an integrated project among the refineries. Historically, we were mainly a European operation, with KPC doing its own business development, but recently all the business development departments joined KPI, and now we are no longer a European company, but a global downstream company. </p><h4>What investments in R&amp;D are going to be of high impact for the sector, and what are your own R&amp;D investments?</h4><p>We have Q8Research, our own R&amp;D center in Rotterdam, and we are trying to improve and widen our activities, especially relating to refining fuel and lube operations. Our R&amp;D center in Rotterdam is one of the most important centers in Europe, especially in the lube industry. They handle more than 1,000 specialty products, concentrating more and more in lube. We are now present in more than 60 countries as Q8Oils, and we are trying to reach new markets with support from our R&amp;D center. The center does not just provide support for KPI but for all K-companies, especially in downstream. We have programs with our sister companies for training and also for collaborative research and other R&amp;D activities.</p><h4>How can the R&amp;D environment in Kuwait become more prominent and effective?</h4><p>We would like to create a major R&amp;D center in Kuwait. In addition to the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research Petroleum Research Center (KPRC), we will have our own, supported by KPI. It will be mainly in downstream, but with complete upstream and downstream petrochemicals activity. We feel that increasing operations here and in the region will need a major research center like this behind it. It is no longer as simple as it used to be. It is time for heavy crude and other difficult types of crude in the upstream side, handling water activities in the upstream, and also about things becoming more complicated in the downstream, especially with the complex refining system we have here in Kuwait, which requires a large R&amp;D and support center to maintain it. </p><h4>Looking at the next three years, what are the main objectives for Q8 and what would you like to achieve moving forward?</h4><p>We have a 2030 Strategy that has been approved by KPC, and we are working in accordance with that strategy, which involves strengthening our position in the world. We have a solid presence throughout the world. In Europe, we have over 5,000 stations and about 70 airports in 20 countries. On the lube side, we are present in almost every part of Europe. Therefore, we seek to ensure that our operations remain efficient and that we maintain a competitive position in Europe. In Asia, we are growing in refining and petrochemicals, and we are also planning to grow in terms of retail stations, jet fuel supplies, and lube operations, in addition to the megaprojects in refining and petrochemicals. We hope to complete our project in Vietnam and then look into similar projects in other Asian countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the current focal points of NTEC's attention?</h4><p>We are instilling the understanding that technology is limitless. NTEC's first objective is to start, develop, and manage technological projects. We have been given the liberty to design business models that best fit the environment by understanding the community's capabilities. The second objective is to deliver advisory and consultancy services through research, government collaboration, and non-government institutes to advise on the best technologies and encourage the adoption of new technology. The third objective is to invest in technology for the purpose of transferring knowledge to the country. This was a significant element of our phase one strategy from 2005 to 2011: learning how to insert certain technologies into sectors and then creating awareness of the benefits of doing so. The last objective is one of the most important, and that is capacity building and training.</p><h4>What phase is the company currently in, and what is to come?</h4><p>The first phase of investment has been completed and we have entered phase two, which was the “span-out mode,“ in which we transferred technology. We decided to segregate tech areas into NTEC subsidiaries, as each have their own individual KPIs but have the same mandate as NTEC at a micro level. We launched companies in life sciences, ICT, and energy, and created an advisory arm alongside an HR management arm. All companies are now operational, and we have entered the third and final phase, the operational phase, which is focused on project development and management. Gaining a solid understanding of the technology we have invested in and then seeing the shift from investment to building user capacity, and implementation, is most exciting. When the penetration of technology reaches people's everyday business, it is very gratifying.</p><h4>What technologies do you see as having the most potential to modernize Kuwait's economy?</h4><p>ICT certainly has a part in everything by default, but the major change is what will take place in Kuwait once it begins adopting new types of renewable energy. Our approach is to teach people about these technologies through pilot projects and then get them to adapt to it. One of the major projects we have completed was a co-op in Kuwait called Zahra Co-op, where we built all of its parking with solar panels for shade. We have a working relationship with the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) and the Kuwait Foundation for the Advancement of Science (KFAS), and we collaborate on several pilot projects in order to create public awareness. We have several projects on the way. One that is approved is the building of a self-sustainable home in one of the residential areas of Kuwait, which will minimize the use of any of the country's traditional sources of energy. The home will be a museum for five years, and people can go in and see how it works. The objective is to show people certain technologies that they can use today that could reduce the waste of energy in Kuwait, and energy consumption on MEW, and give them a better and cleaner life with the use of LED lighting and water purification systems, among other technology.</p><h4>Where do you see the most potential for technological change in Kuwait's energy sector?</h4><p>The need today is not for bricks and mortar or designers, it is energy, as the MEW does not have enough energy to supply the new homes being built in Kuwait. The Public Housing Authority in Kuwait has thus far distributed thousands of plots of land, though not enough power is currently available to support homes to be built. They would have to wait until a new power plant was built. We are trying to present solutions to this problem, as there are technologies everywhere that are developing rapidly. There is technology that uses air to produce water, for example, and it has been available for a long time on industrial scales. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Founded in 1957, Bukhamseen Group Holding is one of the largest financial and industrial companies in Kuwait. What is your vision for the company?</h4><p>Our vision is to continue what we are doing in a more diversified way. When we started the family business and entered into a sector, our goal was to establish a business, find the right management, be profitable, then move to another sector and do the same thing. Our diversified model has allowed us to survive all the hiccups in the market. We concentrate on the companies we have in various sectors to make them leaders in their fields.</p><h4>What are the most profitable investments for Bukhamseen Holding?</h4><p>We are increasing our shares in several banks around the region. Additionally, consumer industries and industries based on day-to-day demand offer great opportunities: water, juice, and food industries, and on the manufacturing and production side, steel, because it is involved in construction and this region is full of new developments. Ultimately, we evaluate every business and investment carefully. We try to only invest in higher-yielding and fast-growing businesses. We avoid attachment to low-yielding investments in order to find more profitable ones, making sure that we are capable of handling rapid change.</p><h4>How has Kuwait's economy developed over the years, and what role does it play in the region today?</h4><p>Kuwait has historically been a center for trade. It is surrounded by big, oil-rich countries—Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Business was created in Kuwait based on merchant trade. After the war between Iraq and Iran and the invasion of Kuwait, families and businesses concentrated on investing in real estate and establishing industries. At the same time, following a phase of legal reform, the banking and insurance sector were supported and businesses and institutions grew stronger. Kuwait has always been very active in ensuring a stable region and is the first to donate toward any crisis. There was an immediate response when Kuwait was invaded. This is a humanitarian country with many charitable institutions, such as the Kuwait Foundation, which finances and builds infrastructure in the region through lending low-interest, long-term loans.</p><h4>With this background in mind, how do you envision Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>The more the countries around us are stabilized, the better the chances for Kuwait to become a future trade center. Regardless of current oil prices, the government will continue backing the private sector, as well as supporting investment going forward. All sectors will do well if the government maintains what it is doing. This will encourage the private sector and oil sectors toward further investment.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see for growth beyond Kuwait?</h4><p>Bukhamseen is looking to Iraq—a country rich in people and resources. New laws for direct investment in Iraq are encouraging this. In 20 years' time, Iraq will be doing well; we see that in trade already. Considering recent events, Egypt is also doing well. Oman, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia are also key growth areas for us. </p><h4>Over the past 50 years, Bukhamseen has seen steady expansion of its businesses. Looking to the next three to five years, what does the future of Bukhamseen Holding look like?</h4><p>Bukhamseen is concentrating on two areas: policies and procedures. We are in the second generation now and entering the third, and we want to continue without any disturbances. We are also developing our product offering. At the same time, from the other side, we want to increase efficiency and make the business stronger and more competitive. We are trying to have fewer loans and decrease our liabilities. Decreasing debt and increasing profitability in all sectors is our main focus. In preparation for future challenges, we are building our resiliency. We are already diversified. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what sectors and markets are you looking to expand Alghanim Industries' portfolio within the Gulf and abroad?</h4><p>We are planning to expand strategically in the years ahead, focusing above all on MENA and South-East Asia. Our best opportunities lie in these emerging and frontier markets, and here in the region where we have long operated at the crossroads of East-West trade. As far as sectors are concerned, consumer electronics, retail, and the food and beverage industries are areas of focus. Then there is our partnership with the Wendy's Company to expand the Wendy's brand across the MENA region. This partnership includes all Wendy's outlets in the UAE, which will serve as a good foundation for growth. Similarly, we acquired in 2013 the Costa Coffee brand in Kuwait. The brand had not had a ton of success here, but we invested in top-tier locations and revamped the menu and are seeing a turnaround. We are also planning on increasing the range of products for Kirby Building Systems, which is a pre-engineered building manufacturer we acquired in the 1970s. </p><h4>How do you view the importance of Kuwait's role on the global stage?</h4><p>We play an important role on the global stage for several reasons. First, Kuwait is at the crossroads of East and West. We have a proud history as a nation of merchants, plying our trade across borders, and building lasting, useful enterprises that play a role in the progress of their time and place. This role puts us in a strong position to contribute to regional economic prosperity. Second, Kuwait has 10% of the world's oil reserves. This gives us outsize power and influence relative to other countries of our size. Third—and most importantly—Kuwait is a myth-shattering example to the world of sectarian cooperation and tolerance. </p><h4>How can Kuwait become more competitive, and what issues will define the country's economic future?</h4><p>Kuwait has some noteworthy strengths and weaknesses, and our economic prospects are bright. On the strengths side, we have solid leadership and guidance under the Emir, His Highness, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. We have a world-class banking sector and governance system that puts us in a strong position to benefit from regional growth. The Central Bank of Kuwait has done a superb job of partnering with the financial services industry to implement the post-2008 regulatory framework. I have observed this first-hand in my role as Chairman of Gulf Bank. It is worth noting here, because our banking system is the foundation upon which all our economic activity is built. I cannot overstate the importance of CBK's leadership to Kuwait's economic climate. On the weaknesses, we face difficulties in engaging Kuwaiti youth in the private sector. It is difficult to persuade people in Kuwait to give up the certainty and security of government employment—where few people, if any lose their jobs—for the greater rewards and risks of the private sector. We can do more to reform public education. In too many instances, education in the Middle East has emphasized memorization over critical thinking. Generations upon generations have been trained to use their minds to store knowledge rather than to apply knowledge to solving problems. We have to change that emphasis. There is the question of diversity, especially when it comes to women in the workforce as a key factor in competitiveness. The MENA gender gap is three times what exists in most developing economies. According to the International Monetary Fund, if this gap were narrowed by just one third, the regional GDP would grow by 6%, or $1 trillion. This is a massive source of potential growth we need to unlock. It is easy for the private sector to stand on the sideline and point out problems. We have a responsibility to be part of the solution, working hand-in-hand with government to encourage this critical transition from past practices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main barriers for SMEs in Kuwait?</h4><p>We are collecting data about SMEs and will eventually establish an information center that will serve as the central point for all information related to SMEs. In the meantime, we undertook a survey as part of formulating our strategy and five-year plan where we worked with the World Bank, independent international experts, government institutions, and more than 70 entrepreneurs and stakeholders from Kuwait. Most participants highlighted that acquiring commercial licenses is the number-one obstacle, as well as acquiring the relevant permission to operate their businesses here. Therefore, we are reviewing all the legislation, regulations, and policies that govern the market to see which of them need to be revised. One of the positive outcomes was the reduction of the minimum capital requirements in April 2015. According to our survey, the second obstacle for SMEs is labor, while access to financing came in at number three.</p><h4>What services does the National Fund provide to entrepreneurs in Kuwait?</h4><p>Based on gaps we see in the market, we divide our services between financial and non-financial support. The financial support comes in the form of either debt or equity, ranging from seed capital to later-stage growth financing. Ideally we should not provide venture capital, but the private sector is not doing this, so  we must address this gap. Debt support comes either directly from us or in collaboration with local banks. These conditions are different, however, because banks are traditionally hesitant to finance a company in its initial years of operation. Banks want financial evidence proving that a company has low risk. Seed capital comes in smaller amounts, so it is an easier form of finance. In terms of non-financial help, this ranges from someone coming to us without an idea to take general or specific training about how to develop an idea, to a more-advanced idea in a specific sector or industry that needs support to develop, test, pilot, and launch. Entrepreneurs have to look at the immediate GCC as their primary market, and then beyond that—regionally and globally—for their wider market. And  with this comes the importance of greater competitiveness.</p><h4>How does the National Fund collaborate with regional and international organizations?</h4><p>We have already signed agreements with various countries that are well known for implementing successful policies and programs to develop SMEs. Our regional partner is the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development (KFED) in Abu Dhabi, which is leading efforts towards a possible federal law for the UAE, adopted from Kuwait's National Fund law in terms of the requirements and structure. We are also working with KFED at the institutional level. We are similar to the Emiratis in our culture and demographics, and we face many common issues in economic development. We have done the same at the global level with the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) from South Korea. Part of that involves exchanging data, information, and learning at the institutional level as well as by individual entrepreneurs. This relationship is also about opening doors for businesses. The SMBA can help our businesses access South Korean markets, and vice-versa. At the invitation of the United Kingdom government, I gave a keynote speech in 4Q2015 at the Commonwealth Business Forum in Malta on entrepreneurship development, SME growth, common challenges, and the Kuwait experience. This forum included 73 countries. Regionally and internationally, other countries are recognizing what we are doing in Kuwait. They recognize that it is a tough job, but it has to be done, and they commend Kuwait for doing it. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>2016 marks the 25th anniversary year of the liberation of Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. What efforts have been made to develop Kuwait's economy over the years?</h4><p>Our growth has been continuous and has been supported by oil revenues, but this has proven to be insufficient, and we as the private sector wish to see more sustainable growth. The government has started to spend on development projects with an ambitious program over the next five years to rebuild ports, build a new airport, a metro station, a railway system, and so forth. It has been positive, but we are behind. The challenge we face today is to continue to diversify our economy, as the private sector's share of GDP represents only 24.6% of GDP; this needs to change.</p><h4>What role do you see diversification and privatization playing in Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>We want to increase awareness among all citizens of Kuwait—not just our members—about the risk of trying to manage an economy that is not diverse. For years, the fear has been that by giving a greater role to the private sector, employment will suffer, because Kuwait's largest employer is the government. But looking at the three largest telecom operators in Kuwait as examples, we have seen how privatization has led to both growth and employment. In the early 1970s, the mobile segment in Kuwait was managed by the Ministry of Communication. In 1983, the Mobile Telecommunications Company (MTC) was set up in Kuwait as the first mobile operator in the region. MTC, known as Zain today, now employs 3,600 Kuwaitis and the price of a mobile line is minimal. Zain is the 10th largest company by assets in Kuwait, and in 2008, it became the fourth largest mobile operator in the world in terms of physical presence. Their growth led them beyond Kuwait, and they are now operating in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Bahrain, Algeria, and others. </p><h4>What are some other sectors that are moving in the direction of privatization?</h4><p>The government should consider the privatization of almost all sectors of the economy (except upstream operations for oil and gas exploration and extraction), notably electricity, water, health and education services, and downstream petroleum industry. We need the private sector to become more established, and employment will follow. The number of Kuwaitis working in the private sector amounts to only 5% of the total national Kuwaiti workforce, while the remainder are employed by the government. It is simple to see the implications of this, economically speaking. </p><h4>How can international cooperation and foreign direct investment (FDI) play a bigger role in Kuwait's economic development, and what is the Chamber doing to attract foreign interest to Kuwait?</h4><p>One positive change in FDI law has been that the Offset Program has been suspended, which has been a disincentive for foreign investors in Kuwait. The program mandates that any company doing anything for the Kuwaiti government for over $164.2 million has to reinvest the equivalent of 35% back into Kuwait over the next ten years. We thought this was illogical and a disincentive for FDI, as it was making projects around 6% more expensive. Based on the feedback we received from international investors—especially those coming into oil—we requested that the Offset Program be suspended. With the program stopped, we will see lower costs and we expect an increase in foreign interest as a result. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Kuwait's FDI landscape evolved in recent years, and how have recent changes in FDI law incentivized foreign investment in Kuwait?</h4><p>Kuwait has recently witnessed several favorable developments in its regulatory and legal framework that enhance its attractiveness as an investment destination. The issuance of new Law No. 116 of 2013 for promoting direct investment in the State of Kuwait, which replaced the previous FDI Law No. 8 of 2001, stipulated several additions that accommodated international best practices pertaining to FDI. The main additional features included establishing a public authority, the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA), which is mandated with the tasks of encouraging both local and foreign investors, promoting Kuwait as an attractive investment location, and streamlining the business environment to enhance the country's competitiveness. It also adopted the “negative list approach" for sectors that are excluded from licensing. This speeds up the licensing process to a maximum of 30 days by establishing a one stop shop, allowing 100% foreign ownership by selecting one of several forms of legal entities, introducing the licensing of representative offices solely to conduct marketing studies for interested investors, and extending incentives and exemptions to both privatization projects and Public Private Partnership (PPP) projects. On the other hand, the new investment law maintained incentives like tax and customs duties exemptions, and guarantees against expropriation, transfer of capital and profits, and protecting project proprietary-information.</p><h4>What economic sectors are open to foreign investors in Kuwait?</h4><p>The adoption of the negative list approach signaled to foreign investors that most economic sectors are open for investment, in accordance with the Council of Ministers decision issued February 2015, whereby very few sectors were excluded for sovereignty purposes, such as upstream oil and gas, or for other considerations. Furthermore, we did not place a threshold on the size of investments eligible for licensing, nor did we simply target FDI as a source of capital per se, as our objective is to attract added value and quality investments that anchor competitive advantage in the country, enhance productivity, and foster national capabilities.</p><h4>What role can FDI play in promoting Kuwaitization as well as attracting know-how and innovation to add value to the domestic economy?</h4><p>We are currently undertaking the necessary steps to develop our business strategy and formulate the ensuing promotional and communications strategies, with the relevant roadmap and action plan to assist us in achieving the tasks we are mandated with under our establishing law, in view of the National Vision 2035, and the strategic objectives identified in the medium-term economic development plans. In this regard, we target efficiency seeking FDI through investors who bring know-how and modern technology to Kuwait, support economic diversification efforts, and build national R&amp;D competencies as well as innovative capabilities, in addition to creating jobs for Kuwaiti youth and providing quality training opportunities. </p><h4>What upcoming government and infrastructure development projects are expected to have a significant impact on the local economy?</h4><p>Kuwait offers a host of lucrative investment opportunities, including strategic projects under the current development plan in sectors pertaining to oil and gas, the North Zone development, electricity and water, urban development and housing, transport and communications, health, education, tourism and media, and the environment. There are also other opportunities under the PPP projects and the privatization program. We are looking forward to attracting FDI that will create needed linkages with our thriving SME sector and local start-ups. We have updated an investment guide that can also assist interested investors in considering various potential opportunities found on our website. We are developing three economic zones in the north, west and south of the country that offer an attractive opportunity for various competitive industries to operate in Kuwait. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the role that the KRCS has played over the past year in responding to such crises regionally and in Kuwait?</h4><p>Currently, the KRCS operates through major humanitarian efforts in providing assistance to vulnerable communities with multiple aid operations conducted throughout the year in countries such as Yemen, Iraq, the Philippines, Indonesia, Somalia, Sudan, Bosnia, Serbia, and more. We also have ongoing major aid operations in Jordan and Lebanon to assist refugees fleeing the difficult situation in Syria, as well as non-stop aid assistance to the people of Palestine in Gaza and the West Bank. Our aid operations as well as our rehabilitation projects and livelihood programs conducted internationally to assist vulnerable communities are millions of dollars' worth of budget programs. On the national level, the KRCS has an internal aid program that is in charge of deploying assistance to less privileged families in Kuwait through the provision of food parcels, non-food item, hygienic kits, clothing, stationary and school bags, hot meals during the month of Ramadan and many more programs that label us a key contributor to the charitable work done within Kuwait. We have earned solid expertise in facilitating assistance during difficult crises such as the one with the Syrian situation. For 2015, our assistance programs to aid the Syrian refugees included many operations in both Jordan and Lebanon. As the Syrian crisis enters its fifth year, we as humanitarians and concerned nations are faced with new challenges for the coming period.</p><h4>How can the private sector, corporations and institutions, play an even bigger role in supporting humanitarian causes, partnering with the KRCS?</h4><p>We encourage and welcome any partnerships for the benefit of humanity through our bilateral relationships with similar National Societies, not only in times of crisis but also by expertise exchange through technical workshops and seminar forums throughout the year for capacity building, or through active participation with leading humanitarian agencies and organizations with the IFRC, The ICRC, ARCO, GCC general secretariat and also with any willing organization that can enhance the efficiency of our implementation strategies, whether logistical or operational solutions. Sometimes the magnitude of a crisis obligates us to cooperate with other entities to ensure our assistance reaches each and every one of our beneficiaries best as possible. We are constantly developing innovative techniques to enhance our assistance programs both nationally and internationally. </p><h4>The International Federation of Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the world's largest humanitarian network, has a collective plan to tackle major challenges facing the world guided by their Strategy 2020 called “Saving Lives, Changing Minds.“ What do you believe will be the major humanitarian challenges facing the Arab region during that period?</h4><p>We are in close and daily interaction with our federation keeping up with the latest pressing matters in the Humanitarian arena. It is no secret that the escalation of the Syrian crisis with its tragic impact on the number of refugee influx to neighboring countries remains a world focus from a humanitarian point of view. Yemen and Iraq are also two major matters that require close attention in terms of the difficulty of the situations and the huge number of innocent souls suffering these circumstances. The KRCS has not stopped its humanitarian assistance to the Syrian refugees both in Lebanon and Jordan since the beginning of the crisis; we also have conducted an urgent and large scale aid intervention in both Yemen and Iraq since June 2015 and still continue to provide assistance there. We continue our yearly assistance in Gaza and the West bank, where we recently had an aid convoy sent to Gaza in November 2015 with food and non-food relief items. We remain loyal and committed to our ethical and humanitarian obligations anywhere in the world. From what we witness, the refugee crisis is one of the top main challenges in our region especially in this tough winter anticipated to be the strongest to hit the region in 30 years, which brings us to one main and internationally growing concern, which is the increasing global environmental threat not only in the world but on our region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lending-terms]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the impact of the Kuwait Fund's investments and projects internationally?</h4><p>We target not just specific sectors but rather the desired projects of different countries. Depending on the country we are investing in, we might have some overall sector preferences that stand out such as social, education, or basic natural resources, such as water. If those sectors are within the preferred consideration of projects, they receive extra attention in terms of lending. The priority of the country comes first, as do the economic benefits of the specific developments in the country. Recent projects have ranged from schools to electricity and drinking water for cities like Havana, Cuba. We have supported a lot of projects in Uzbekistan, Cuba, China, Egypt, and Lebanon. We totaled 13 projects by March 2015, which is typically a busy month for us.</p><h4>What is the criteria you use when providing grants for a project?</h4><p>Normally, when we receive a request, we consider it based on available infrastructure taking into account the status of project when we analyze the technical information. We take initial approval from the board in conjunction with the studies provided, and after the appraisal we are then able to give a grant. The process varies depending on the project, and countries will not always come in with studies fully prepared. Most of the projects require a complete financing plan, and most countries are still in the middle of this process when they first present to us. </p><h4>What are some of the challenges the Kuwait Fund faces in financing aid and development projects?</h4><p>Normally in any project, the biggest challenge is in procurement. Because regulations may differ, we need to prepare for any potential problems. Agreeing on specific procurement can be a challenge at times, but it is our necessary priority to agree on financing plans. At the moment, we are collaboratively working on what we call parallel financing, in which we work with different partners on the varying aspects of financing one project. Some of the projects have specific regulations and are required to have local financiers or contractors. </p><h4>What are the Fund's priorities when it comes to aid allocation?</h4><p>At the moment, we do not have a specific formula for allocation as much as an occasional commitment to a specific disaster or situation. In general, our allocations are based in Arab countries by mandate; Arab countries need to be no less than 50% of our commitment. We work to fulfill that as well as allocate funds for countries elsewhere, dividing contracts based on need. </p><h4>Have any projects been especially successful?</h4><p>We like to consider every project a success story, though the rate of success is always evidenced by seeing firsthand the before and after. This is, of course, difficult with some 800 projects. I, however, have seen many projects from start to finish, and it is always rewarding. We were especially encouraged by an irrigation project funded in China due to the people's tremendous reaction upon its completion. Our tendency is to fund large projects with overall economic impact rather than a focus on an individual group. There is still nothing more rewarding than, for example, seeing a hydroelectric dam provide much needed water to a group of people. </p><h4>How important is it for others to see Kuwait Fund as a partner in development?</h4><p>At this point, that is exactly what we were created for, to be a development aid for institutions. Certainly, we should be perceived as a partner in development. We are working in 104 countries around the world and cooperating with even more.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Kuwait Fund in 2016?</h4><p>We are working on plans for a specific program, and given that there are currently no obstacles, we hope to make progress on that. By 2016, we hope the conflict in Yemen will have come to an end. We have some programs that we are looking at right now on behalf of the government so that we can help fulfill some of Yemen's governmental obligations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>There is an increasing recognition of the importance of SMEs in supporting overall economic growth. According to a recent survey of nearly 50,000 firms in 104 countries, SMEs provide as much as two-thirds of all employment, with small firms contributing more to employment in low-income countries than high-income countries. Our cross-country research also suggests that small and young SMEs are the net job creators in many countries. At the same time, research shows that growth and productivity among SMEs varies widely from country to country.</p><p>In Kuwait, having a healthy, vibrant, barrier-free SME ecosystem is critical to economic development. In fact, the private sector is anticipated to provide employment opportunities for a rapidly growing Kuwaiti labor force and to lead economic activities in various sectors to reduce the country's heavy reliance on oil resources.<br>This aligns closely with Kuwait's vision 2035, which envisages a revival of the entrepreneurial spirit of its people. This revival will allow the private sector to take a leading role in the economy, creating ample jobs for nationals, with the government playing only a supporting role. Through vision 2035, Kuwait expects to create a business climate that encourages local investment, competition, diversification, and growth. <br>Within the World Bank Group, our team has analyzed Kuwait's economic activities, with an aim to assessing SME's contribution to GDP, value-added employment, and productivity. The analysis reveals that the value added by SMEs in Kuwait trails far behind peer economies. </p><p>In Kuwait, despite 94% of Kuwaiti firms being categorized as SMEs, the share of SMEs in total value added is only 3.1% This share is concentrated in the real estate and retail sub-sectors. SMEs employ 23% of the total workforce in Kuwait. However, SMEs' contribution to the economy is marginal at 3% of GDP. <br>What are the main challenges faced by SMEs? As a result of in-depth discussions with entrepreneurs and stakeholders from different segments of small businesses (nearly 70 entrepreneurs), the National Fund and World Bank Group have identified a number of challenges.</p><p>Among these are excessive regulations, which hinder business activities from start up through growth to exiting; a lack of access to developed land and commercial and industrial premises; challenges recruiting and retaining skilled Kuwaitis in the private sector due to generous remuneration and benefits offered in the public sector; a small domestic market dominated by government and large corporations; a lack of access to finance for SMEs; and a limited capacity of programs meant to support.</p><p> SMEs owners have said that a majority of workers prefer government jobs because of the lower risk and the perceived low social status of entrepreneurs. The World Bank Group has been closely following the Government of Kuwait's efforts to address some of these constraints by supporting the diversification of the local economy and promoting the growth of an SME ecosystem. These efforts have led to the establishment of the National Fund for SME Development, which aims to help the country make great strides in its efforts to support youth, combat unemployment, and enable the private sector to drive economic growth. The Bank Group is privileged to work with the National Fund in supporting its vision.</p><p>Our current engagement with the Fund focuses on supporting its institutional establishment through a two-year technical assistance project, which supports implementation of the National Fund Strategy and takes a holistic approach to the development of an SME Ecosystem. In particular, we are supporting the National Fund in the following thematic areas: SME business environment, SME business development, entrepreneurship culture development, data collection, monitoring and evaluation, and the organizational set up and IT architecture.</p><p>Going forward, more work will be needed to advance the specialization and internationalization of SMEs. This will entail improving the efficiency of SMEs in order to link them with local, regional and international value chains. The National Fund will take on this specialized role, while continuing to serve the wider community of SMEs in Kuwait, and improving the business environment to facilitate entry, retention, and exit of enterprises. I would encourage entrepreneurs to take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the National Fund to help achieve their dream ideas. I also encourage the National Fund to provide more venues for interaction where public and private sector representatives can address common challenges, discuss opportunities for SME growth, and ensure that the voices of entrepreneurs are well-heard. When governments and the private sector work together, they can have a major impact on diversifying economies and promoting inclusive growth. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The US and Kuwait have long been strong ally nations both politically and economically. What is your assessment of US-Kuwaiti bilateral relations currently?</h4><p>The US and Kuwait have a long-standing relationship that pre-dates the US' role in Kuwait's liberation from Iraq 25 years ago. Five generations of Kuwaitis have studied at the university level in the US.  The US and Kuwaiti militaries have worked closely for decades, while our automobiles have been sold here for over 70 years. Currently, Kuwait is a strong ally in supporting efforts to stabilize the region and fight against terror organizations such as ISIL. There are hundreds of US restaurants and retail stores throughout Kuwait. There is great interest in procuring the latest technologies from US companies.  All this means that the bilateral relationship is as strong as it has ever been.     </p><h4>Bilateral trade volumes between the two nations exceeded $15 billion in 2014, up 188% from $5.2 billion in 2009. To what do you attribute this growing interest in the Kuwait market?</h4><p>Kuwaiti citizens have a high level of disposable income. There has always been an interest in US vehicles and that continues to grow, with US fashion and food also of high interest to Kuwaitis.  The US exports a lot in the oil and gas sector as well as in the education sector.  Within the GCC region only, Saudi Arabia sends more students at the university level to the US than any other.  With the globalization of the world's economy and the success US companies have experienced in previous years in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, it is only natural for companies to continue their growth efforts and look to expand to Kuwait as well.</p><h4>Kuwait is the 37th major foreign investor in the US with $1.3 billion and the US is also the largest market for Kuwaiti imports. Which areas of bilateral trade and investment between the US and Kuwait do you identify having the most potential for growth?</h4><p>There are several areas of opportunity for US companies in Kuwait.  The number of Kuwaitis that pursue higher education opportunities in the US continues to grow.  There are significant projects in the oil and gas sector as well as in alternative energy as Kuwait seeks to increase its production of renewable energy to cover 15% of Kuwait's electricity needs by 2030. Kuwait's National Development Plan 2015-20 incorporates a number of large infrastructure projects, including plans for airport expansion and construction of a new terminal, the construction of a metro rail system and additional rail projects, a new Kuwait University campus and other educational projects, and the expansion of seven hospitals and construction of two additional new hospitals, among other major developments. In all of these areas, there will be contracts for project managers and consultants, architects and designers, engineers, technical experts, and for firms that can provide human capital training and development programs.  Additional areas of opportunity abound in the automotive, defense, healthcare, information technology, and environmental technology sectors. </p><h4>While Kuwait is currently the fifth largest market for American goods among Arab nations, it is the fastest growing in terms of US exports in the GCC, up 41% in 2014. How can US-Kuwait trade relations be enhanced so that investors and companies may trade and invest  with greater ease?</h4><p>While there are many excellent opportunities in Kuwait for US companies, improvement to the regulatory environment would help increase the trade relationship even more.  There has been progress with the implementation of a new law allowing up to 100% foreign owned entities, a new public-private partnership law, and the creation of the National Fund for SME Development that supports SMEs and entrepreneurs in an effort to develop the private sector in Kuwait and diversify its economy.  But more can always be done. According to the World Bank, Kuwait ranks 101st in the world, and sixth in the GCC, in ease of doing business. Reducing the number of steps required to do business in Kuwait would improve efficiencies, lower costs, and increase the already excellent trade relationship we have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your philosophy on the role of the regulator in this region, and how do you support the role of takaful?</h4><p>Our role is to ensure a healthy environment for the operations of the overall insurance sector in Bahrain, specifically conventional and takaful. That will happen by ensuring there are proper regulations in conformity with the best international standards and with the existing development in the market overall. With respect to takaful, it represents almost 22% of the overall insurance premiums and is one of the growing areas whereby we see that the average growth during the past five years has been around 15%. It is a double-digit growth, which clearly shows that this industry has a great potential to grow and the appetite for takaful products has increased. We are also innovative with respect to the regulations governing takaful, because we have revamped the solvency ratios. It is different to conventional products, although we ensure that such changes are in line with the best international standards of calculating or evaluating risk. Based on that, we have come up with different solvency ratios that were introduced in January 2015, after working closely on this for a period of almost one and a half years. We also consulted religious scholars to ensure we were not deviating from the sharia principles on such calculations. They gave us the stamp of approval in terms of the solvency requirements for takaful. The main idea behind takaful is solidarity—that the two share the risk, and, at the same time, share the profit. The concept of Islamic finance is based on profit and loss sharing basis. </p><h4>What do you see in terms of momentum and will among regional regulators to coalesce a single regulatory regime?</h4><p>We are pro-GCC passporting. This is because of the belief that it will create a bigger market, be it insurance, investment, or even banking. You can observe this happening automatically in certain sectors, such as capital markets. Today, obviously the capital markets are open in a way that all GCC investors can invest in whatever market. Frankly, this has helped to boost the existing capital markets in several GCC countries due to the fact that investors are free to underwrite, invest, or buy and sell whatever GCC shares in the overall market. Thereby, it has created a larger market of almost $1 trillion in the capital markets. It shows that there are positive developments happening in the sector. If you apply this in a market such as insurance, then it will help to create a large insurance market, be it life, health, or other types of insurance services. It will also open the door for those markets with overcapacity to tap other markets in the region. If that happens, we could look at the area of passporting more closely. We in Bahrain are pro-GCC passporting for products, because we believe that is the way forward to attract more FDI to the region, as well as create a larger market that could be developed over the years. With this, there would be a greater possibility for a joint venture between companies and more consolidation for business.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[A Real Toy Story]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[a-real-toy-story]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What first attracted Famosa Group to Mexico in 2010?</h4><p>The Company was founded in Spain in 1957, and Famosa was born from the alliance of a number of toymakers in Toy Valley, in Alicante, Spain. The group formed in order to remain competitive in the market due to difficulty finding funding, changing technologies, and the emergence of plastic toys. More than 50 years later we continue to be Spain's premiere toy manufacturer, leading the industry in Spain and Portugal and being firmly established in more than 50 countries, including France, Italy, Mexico, and the US. When we enter new markets, we grow through distributors first; hence, here in Mexico we established partnerships with other toy manufactures a few years ago. In Mexico, we had solid numbers with our distributors. However, in the Ride Ons and Outdoor category, importing bulky products from Spain was expensive due to transportation costs and, considering that the potential business in the US and Mexico was huge, we decided to open a factory in the city of Monterrey. We saw this not only as a base to expand in Mexico, but as a way to reach the US market.</p><h4>How much of your production in Mexico is for export?</h4><p>Right now, about 30% of the volume manufactured in Mexico is exported. The problem that we have been facing is that we do not have enough capacity, which is a good problem to have. The factory has more than doubled in volume over the last two years; therefore, we are evaluating some other possibilities of investment or partnerships that could help us satisfy the needs of the Mexican and North American markets.</p><h4>What are the biggest challenges in transitioning from distribution networks to operations based in Mexico?</h4><p>The challenge is to understand the market. We are a Spanish company and in Spain we are market leaders. Here, we have been growing and things have not been that easy. You have to understand the cultural differences, to know why a product's success in Spain may not be always replicated in the Mexican or US markets. In order to be more successful in our export business from Mexico, we do market research in the US to understand the consumer and what is required compared to what we are manufacturing in Mexico or Spain in order to adapt the products. One of the challenges is not just cultural differences but regulatory issues for products such as battery-operated ride-ons, which mean that we need to manufacture to different specifications in the US than we do in Europe.</p><h4>What have you done right to be so successful in understanding these cultural differences?</h4><p>It requires constant communication to present business cases that make sense. Last year was good for the toy industry worldwide, with a growth rate of around 7%. In Mexico, we grew more than 10% and Famosa is gaining market share, entering new categories like plush, developing new products in nurturing, mini dolls, ride-ons, and particularly in the outdoor category, where we became market leader with more than 48% of the market share. What has been changing in the toy industry is the importance of licensed products; that is to say, products that use characters from movies, books, TV shows, or even computer games and apps. In Mexico, especially in the outdoor and ride-ons category, we work with licensed products. We have important partnerships with Disney and Nickelodeon, which are major licensees here in Mexico. Licensed products are definitely a considerable driver of growth for the toy sector. In 2015, there are significant licenses worldwide, such as Star Wars, Frozen, and Paw Patrol, which are driving the change in the way the market moves.</p><h4>Has the rise in computer games and other kinds of devices for kids changed your approach to product development?</h4><p>The time kids spend playing is now shared with TV and computer games; therefore, this is changing the way the toy industry moves since more products now have to be made around the entertainment. That is why at Famosa we are developing new TV series PINY and Mutant Busters, which will be launched in 2016 accompanied by apps kids can play after watching the series. There will also be licensed products such as clothes, bedding, school supplies, and of course a complete line of toys. At Famosa, we will continue creating products that foster children's imagination.</p><h4>What is the importance of your facility for Nuevo Leon?</h4><p>We have more than120 employees there. We are located in Parque Industrial Kalos in Apodaca, and we have been working closely with the community there. We try to ensure that most of our employees live around the area and we work constantly with the authorities to ensure they know we are investing and creating jobs in the region. Apodaca was ranked as the happiest city in Mexico last year and we believe that Famosa had a part to do with it.</p><h4>Has the government been supportive in terms of setting up your operation there?</h4><p>Yes, and since we opened the factory we have been growing without any issues. Our decision was to create more jobs in an easy way so that we can react faster; in this industry you have to go with the momentum and for that we need to react quickly. Flexibility has been one of the strengths for setting up the business here. The industry in Mexico is developed and the country has the talent to manufacture what we need.</p><h4>What are your goals for the near future as International General Manager?</h4><p>My objective for the next two to three years is to develop our subsidiaries and grow in new markets. Our expansion plans are going in the right direction. The idea is to develop products keeping in mind that they must have international appeal. We must be able to launch products that can be equally successful, for example, in Russia, Brazil, Mexico, or Spain. We need a truly international marketing team that fully understands and gathers feedback from all the countries in which we are present.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Build & Expand]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[build-expand]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights for Barclays over 2015?</h4><p>We had two main goals for 2015. One of these was to build and expand our brand. We reshaped our strategy at the beginning of 2014, and one of the ideas that emerged from that was to position our brand in a different and unique way in this market. Last year was really the first complete year of this new strategy. Our other goal was more related to redesigning our financial operations, given that in recent years our operation was not as profitable as before, so it became critical for us to create a more sustainable business model. We have succeeded in both of these goals. According to the midterm results, and our end of year projections, we have returned to fourth position in the sector, regarding total revenue, which is our benchmark. We had reduced somewhat our position in terms of market share, over the last couple of years, but have now managed to reshape our business successfully with a great focus on our revenue and customer centricity. We see this outcome as a result of the market reaction to our new approach and our differentiation practices. Our revenue line is growing faster than the market average, and we are gaining business in sectors and places where we were not that competitive before. Barclays is also getting positive feedback from its customers. We are quite happy with the qualitative results, which are very important for us since we do not measure ourselves only in financial terms. We have what we call a corporate-led strategy, and our franchise is in fact quite strong and certainly ready to continue growing in the coming years.</p><h4>What is the role of innovation at Barclays, and how do you assess the receptiveness of the Mozambican market to new technologies?</h4><p>There is innovation that is visible to the customer but also innovation that you introduce to gain more efficiency and eventually to provide a more convenient service to our customer. Typically a client does not realize that this innovation is going on in the background, but it is a huge focus for us. Banks are increasingly exploring the potential of digital services. People need to relate to the bank and this is where our brand comes in. Mozambique is growing so fast that there is a lot of competition in chasing new business and retaining existing business. Throughout 2014, we introduced a number of digital platforms and some quite interesting innovations that we were still busy rolling out in 2015. The one that is unique is an ATM with deposit-taking functionalities. No other bank in the country, even today, offers this. We have seen a lot of uptake from customers, but it took a little bit for people to actually start using and trusting this new ATM machine, by putting their money in and receiving a receipt. They are used to going to a branch, and it took time for them to start trusting this technology. We are now seeing people reacting positively, and hear that most are seeing great benefits in the new system. In the fourth quarter we also looked at rolling out more products and unique initiatives such as the World Miles Platinum Credit Card, which Barclays has introduced around the world. The main thing that distinguishes this Barclays card is that you can then redeem points from the card and use them in almost any airline across the world. There are also some other sophisticated platforms that we are bringing to corporate customers, which are innovations for Mozambique, but they are not so evident in the marketplace. We have brought in BARX, which is a trading platform for foreign currency, where large corporates can trade different currencies online from their offices, linked to the Barclays systems. I think the oil and gas industry will really enjoy the functionalities that we bring in with that. It is also very much designed to meet the needs of large corporates; for example, it integrates with SAP on clients' accounting systems, in which orders introduced in the banking system will be reflected in their own accounting systems. This is a unique solution for organizations that have millions of transactions and manage treasury functions centrally.</p><h4>What is Barclay's approach to human capital?</h4><p>HR is at the core of our strategy, and will remain central to our operations going forward. We are redesigning the ways we source staff, the interviewing process, and our criteria for selecting candidates. We are focusing more on values and not as much on technical skills, and want to foster diversity and hire people who think outside of the box. We have also introduced a new graduates program, which selected top candidates out of several universities already using this new approach. We are very keen on seeing the results of this new internal training and mentoring program, and we aim to provide the right set of skills to each of them and also benefit from the younger “out of the box" thinking these new graduates can bring to our organization in several sectors. If the result is as good as we expect, this program will be repeated in 2016 after the first graduate internships are concluded.</p><h4>What are Barclays' goals for the coming year?</h4><p>Our goal is clear; we want to be the best bank in Mozambique, not the largest. It is important to know how we measure ourselves, and not just focus on the market challenges and competition. We want to affirm our presence as a truly local, regional, and global bank, as we understand the country and believe we offer services at the same quality level, if not better, than all of our competitors in the market, especially in the corporate and investment sectors and toward our affluent customers. Mozambicans certainly know that Barclays has inherited the historical knowledge and patrimony from BPD, incorporated in 1977, after the country's independence. We are proud to say that almost half of the people who work at the bank are still from BPD, and carry with them great experience, both from the banking sector as well as a unique market knowledge. The fact that we are part of Barclays Africa Group is also a great asset to us and to our clients, as it is one of the largest financial institutions on the continent and is present in 13 different countries, truly understanding Africa. We have gained of a lot from the knowledge about specific sectors and markets from which we operating from. Ultimately we are a global brand with offices all around the world, giving us the required connectivity and trust to work with global players. We really want to make 2016 the year in which we consolidate this ambition for corporate and investment banking, for commercial clients, and for premier and prestige clients. We are on the right track and I have no doubts that we will be able to fulfill our vision.</p>]]></richbody0content>

That was an improvement on the country's 2.4% growth in 2014. What is significant is that this 3% was achieved because in 2H2015 there was a clear increase in the growth rate, especially in the last month of the year. In 2016, growth of 3.5 to 4% is expected, driven by the implementation of major infrastructure projects and the entry into production of new mines. The importance of commodities in our exports and the strong relationship with certain markets, such as China, has a huge influence on the performance of the economy. This is something that has to be solved over the coming years. Promoting the diversification of our economy is one of the challenges for the incoming administration.</p><h4>Which sectors of the Peruvian economy should be diversified and bolstered?</h4><p>We are rich in natural resources and that brings with it opportunities to develop our agro-industry—and not only agriculture, but agribusiness as a whole to turn Peru into a processor and supplier of food to other countries. Currently, the total agricultural land on the coast used for agro-exports is around 100,000ha. In the coming three or four years we will reach about 250,000-300,000ha because of new irrigation projects getting underway. For example, Chavimochic in the north involves around 60,000ha of new land, and Majes Siguas in the south is about 40,000ha. Those two projects alone represent 100,000ha of new land. The projects are beginning their construction phase now, which will take three years. We will probably be selling the land at YE2016, and it will come online within six years. But when we talk about national resources and food processing, we have to talk not only about the coast, but also the highlands and the Amazon region. In the highlands, our portfolio includes two portions the so-called Longitudinal of the Sierra, a road running from north to south all across the country. We have also called the tender for the implementation of an Amazon Waterway, which will help stimulate the economy of a large region of the country. There are also huge opportunities in activities such as our forestry and the wood industry, tourism, metal mechanics, and the construction industry. To realize this potential, we have to work on strengthening the infrastructure. This is not a small country and it is also challenging because of the geography, which strains our internal and external connectivity. Besides Callao Port, where DP World and Maersk are now working, we have Mota-Engil at Paita Port in the north, which is Peru's second most important port. In the south we have Matarani Port with the local Romero Group. Nowadays, we are evaluating three unsolicited proposals coming from the private sector for the Salaverry, Chimbote, and Ilo Ports. There is an evaluation process for any unsolicited proposals to align them with the Ministry's objectives, in this case the Ministry of Transport and Communications. For Chimbote, we will be issuing a Declaration of Interest in March 2016. At that point we will open up the information to the public and any other company will be free to compete with the proposal. We are always thinking in terms of competition, as that is best. We will be awarding this project during 2016, and depending on whether there is somebody interested in competing for it, the process will take several months. If no party expresses an interest in participating in competition with the proposer, we will award the project in May 2016. The Chimbote Port proposal relates to containers, and was presented by a large European company. The expansion of the middle class is driven the demand for homes and the expansion of the retail industry. That makes not only real estate an investment opportunity, but also promotes a whole chain of local suppliers throughout the construction industry. ProInversión has to continue working to develop infrastructure and public services and to promote productive investments working alongside with the regional governments.</p><h4>How is ProInversión working to create and reinforce the synergies between the private and public sectors, and to promote projects based on the PPP model?</h4><p>Over the past few years we have awarded more than $15 billion in different projects. These have mainly been in infrastructure. Nowadays, we are also working in education and health. The idea is to continue that trend. The Peruvian government has recently improved the regulations on PPPs in order to incorporate best practices recommended by OECD's Principles for the Public Governance of PPP, to consolidate a clear, predictable, and legitimate institutional framework supported by competent and well-resourced authorities, to ground the selection of PPP partnerships in value for money, and to use the budgetary process transparently to minimize fiscal risks and ensure the integrity of the procurement process.</p><h4>What are the main challenges a foreign direct investor faces when coming to Peru?</h4><p>Peru has no external barriers to FDI, and has an open economy. We have established an attractive investment policy dating back to the 1990s. We have consolidated this policy with our free trade agreements. There are almost no restrictions on any kinds of economic activities, just a few on some professional services, but they are not important restrictions. We allow for the free movement of capital. Foreign investors have the same rights and obligations as local investors under our national treatment principle. We have to work on investment facilitation to eliminate the red tape that still exists, especially at the local government level. This is particularly the case in the interior of the country where we need to improve governance. We have to work with them to review the procedures for licenses and permits. We are looking to everyone in the world who wants to assume the challenge of Peruvian development. We do not have a geographical preference regarding the origin of our investors; we are open to everybody, but we want the best. We want the best operators for our PPP projects and we also want the top companies for each activity. This is the only way we can return to 5-6% growth levels. Peru will be able to recover this level of growth in the coming years, most likely after 2016. There is a strong macroeconomic basis for this growth because Peru's fiscal policy is very clear and it will not change regardless of who is in power. The way forward for us is clear and there will not be any dramatic changes. Foreign companies can set up facilities in Peru in order to turn the country into a hub and an export platform in order to reach the markets that are opened up through our free trade agreements, including now the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>AZAL reduced its prices for economy class seats on international flights by 20-30% in the summer of 2015. How does this new strategy help promote a vision of a more affordable airfare in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We have taken several important steps in accordance with President Ilham Aliyev's instructions to reduce air ticket prices. Since August of 2015, Azerbaijan Airlines has applied a 20-30% discount to the minimum existing tariffs for economy class travel to all international destinations for all passengers. The number of tickets sold at this tariff makes up 30% of all seats. It is necessary to note that economy class services are preserved for all passengers. AZAL now offers low-budget passenger transportation lines for the most popular flights of Baku-Antalya, Baku-Istanbul, and Baku-Moscow. The final sale price of tickets for the flights does not exceed ‚¬99 one-way. Unlike standard low-cost models, AZAL provides a number of advantages in its low-cost directives; for example, there is no additional registration fee or fee for choosing seats in the cabin. AZAL is keen to reduce prices for international flights. Recently, a new budget promo tariff was introduced on the Baku-Moscow flight, which does not include luggage. We also plan to open a new budget flight to the resort town of Alanya. The list of budget flights will continue to expand over the summer of 2016.</p><h4>Joining the ranks of companies like Emirates, Lufthansa, and British Airways, AZAL was recently awarded a prestigious four-star rating from the international audit company Skytrax. What are the different qualities measured by Skytrax that go into this rating?</h4><p>The rating of airlines by Skytrax is measured on a scale ranging from one to five stars and is recognized by the aviation community as an unbiased and indisputable criterion in service quality rating. According to the current rating of Skytrax, a total of 37 airlines are registered at the rating of four stars. By receiving the four-star rating, AZAL has joined well-known global carriers such as Emirates, Air France, Lufthansa, Turkish Airlines, KLM, British Airways, Japan Airlines, and others. Skytrax auditors virtually evaluate all aspects of airline activity, from the process of buying a ticket to the service and comfort offered on board. The total criteria measured for the airline rating exceed 800. Skytrax pays attention to each indicator, ranging from the airline's website functionality, passenger registration, comfort in business lounge, assortment on menu, to the state of the aircraft. At the same time, a detailed assessment was made into the cabin's condition, its design and cleanness, onboard entertainment, crew uniforms, crew treatment of passengers, and operating efficiency. I am also glad that the Azerbaijani national carrier was nominated for the Skytrax award of World Airline Awards in the global category of “World Airline that achieved most progress," taking its place of honor among such global carriers as Air France and Delta Air Lines. Skytrax conducts audits and assessments of airports as well, awarding the Heydar Aliyev International Airport a four-star rating, putting it in a row of such hubs as Heathrow London, Frankfurt, Abu Dhabi, and others.</p><h4>What are AZAL's plans for increasing the number of foreign airlines that fly to the regions of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is interested in attracting foreign air carriers to fly to the country's regions. We hold appropriate negotiations with airlines, including low-cost airlines. These flights promote tourism development in our country. Azerbaijan has many beautiful places that foreign guests will undoubtedly enjoy. In addition, the maintenance of regional airports is much cheaper and ticket prices can be lower than similar flights to Baku.</p><h4>The first successful Baku-New York-Baku flight with the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner took place for AZAL in November of 2015. As this is set to be a regular flight for AZAL, what is the importance of this route for AZAL?</h4><p>The first regular flight from Baku to New York was carried out on September 24th, 2014. The flights were operated by comfortable Airbus-A340 aircrafts, which are designed for long-haul flights. Direct non-stop flights to New York became a landmark event in the modern history of AZAL and marked a transition to a higher level of development. After a transatlantic flight test on November 7th, AZAL operates regular Baku-New York flights with the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, one of the most modern aircraft that excellently combine the latest technical advances. Due to the use of the latest technology, the aircraft meets the highest safety standards and is advantageous for this operation. With a convenient schedule for direct passengers of New York flights and for those who use Baku as a transfer point, the flight turned out to be attractive to travelers from Tbilisi, Tehran, Tel Aviv, and other cities.</p><h4>With an enormous international fan base, how is AZAL preparing to accommodate the influx of visitors in anticipation of the Formula One Baku Grand Prix that will take place in the summer of 2016?</h4><p>In recent years, we have gained good experience of major international events held in Baku. Baku hosted the popular music contest, Eurovision, in 2012 and the First European Games at a very high level in the summer of 2015. Heydar Aliyev International Airport experienced unprecedented passenger numbers and volumes of baggage during and after the First European Games. The passenger traffic of Heydar Aliyev International Airport exceeded 280,000 people, including over 228,000 passengers of international flights. In this period, over 28,000 foreigners visited Azerbaijan. Not only did the airport face unique challenges in transporting large numbers of athletes and their baggage over a short period, it also had to ensure that business as usual continued undisturbed. It was the dedication, enthusiasm, spirit, and hard work of every stakeholder involved in the program that enabled Baku to deliver such a truly remarkable and unforgettable Games. The latest scientific and technical achievements used in international aviation are applied in the new terminal with a total area of 65,000sqm in order to ensure flight safety. I am sure that during Formula One, as well as the Islamic Solidarity Games scheduled for 2017 in Baku, AZAL will ensure a high level of safety, comfort, and quality service for the passengers.</p><h4>With parliamentary elections taking place in Azerbaijan in November of 2015, how will the new parliament help continue to improve the national vision for the domestic aviation infrastructure of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Since the day Azerbaijan gained independence, the country's government and parliament have provided continued support to civil aviation. Legislation in the field of civil aviation has been brought into line with international standards and legal norms. I am confident of even closer cooperation with the Azerbaijani Parliament in its new composition. </p><h4>AZAL has been steadily increasing the number of flights every year. What were the main challenges for your company in 2015, and what is your outlook for the year 2016?</h4><p>The main problem that the airlines around the world face is the financial crisis. The difficult economic situation in many countries has led to a decrease in the purchasing power of the population, in many cases making them save on expenses such as vacations abroad. Many private companies are also trying to minimize their costs. Therefore, launching low-budget transportation to the most popular destinations was very important step for us. As mentioned, we plan to work in this direction in order to present the most favorable and flexible terms in our pricing policy. In parallel, we will continue negotiating with our international colleagues to operate flights to new destinations and conclude code share agreements.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a group with diversified business interests, which sectors are most represented in your portfolio?</h4><p>Ordabasy Group is a diversified business group, with energy and oil and gas being our key businesses. Our portfolio comprises many companies, one of which is Kazakhstan Utility Systems in the energy sector. About 25% of the country's population uses energy generated and provided by us. We cover the two biggest regions; industrial Karaganda, where we have the generation and networks, and Shymkent, where we only provide power to local customers. In oil and gas, we have various projects underway. With oil, we executed a successful 95% exit from the Maten Petroleum Company last year. We maintain a 5% stake in the company, but it's mostly symbolic at this point. We are 100% owners of Ansagan Petroleum, which will go from the research phase to the development phase by the end of this year. We entered KazAzot as well, and while we are not a managing partner, we are a significant equity participant nevertheless. Another area where we are increasingly active is geological research. We just purchased one of the biggest gold mines, Ubileyny, and we stand to become a solid player in the gold market. We also have promising copper locations. Another significant direction for us is in financial services, where we are participating in two Kazakhstani banks, Qazaq Bank and RBK Bank. We are 40% partners in Falah Gold Fund from Abu Dhabi. In addition, we also own 100% of Amanat Insurance companies, and we have certain local funds like DK Invest, which invests in real estate and construction projects. This year we purchased the biggest cable operator, Alma TV, which we are transforming from a cable operator to a communication company that also provides internet services. It is the second biggest B2C internet provider in Kazakhstan after Kazakh Telecom. That's a major milestone for the company. Another important business line is construction through our company Tarlan. We also own the biggest pharmaceutical chain in Kazakhstan, Europharma. They participate additionally in government purchases, providing a channel for the large international pharmaceutical companies to sell their products in Kazakhstan. We are active in real estate and we own several business centers as well as our Ordabasy Industrial Zone in Shymkent, which was a tire plant in the Soviet period.</p><h4>What are the most promising sectors in the current economic climate?</h4><p>In the mid term, we are focusing on energy, oil and gas, telecoms, and geological areas, including gold and copper. Oil is a limited resource, and I believe it will return to a fair price, possibly $60-70 per barrel. That will also broaden the opportunities that are available to us. Nonetheless, diversification is crucial for the growth of our company and the country as a whole. It allows us to spread risk and also take advantage of different cycles in the economy in various fields and sectors, enabling us to move quickly to make the most of opportunities as they arise. A diversified portfolio is a balanced portfolio, and that's a key objective for us. This is not a large country population-wise—only 17 million people—which means that in order to be big, you must be diversified.</p><h4>How important is it to reach out to international companies to make new partnerships?</h4><p>This year our group became more present and visible than ever before. We launched a new website that is also in English. We are looking for international partners, particularly Chinese and Russian, with whom we have good working relations. Because of the economic situation, there aren't many investors coming to Kazakhstan right now, but things will eventually pick up.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Depending on how the regional crisis develops, this year will not be easy. We expect the situation to improve around 2017-2018, though 2016 will still be an interesting year. We will continue to be active next year, and since we have focused on being diversified, we always have interesting areas to focus on. Currently, we are particularly focused on telecommunications. We want to create strong companies that lead their respective sectors, and that may mean going public to attract more investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Sobha Group's approach to being a backward-integrated organization and how does this fit in with the overall capability of the company?</h4><p>Over the past 20 years, we have built our strength as a fully backward-integrated organization. In essence, we maintain total control of all of our activities. We have developed in-house expertise to meet all crucial aspects of construction. We are perhaps the only construction company globally that has all of its activities fully backward integrated. We manage the design, engineering, manufacturing, and contracting processes, along with all other critical processes in the real estate development value chain. This gives us tremendous and complete control over the quality of our end product, which is the most significant benefit. This approach has enabled us to deliver the highest-quality products in the industry, spanning four decades. From my perspective, as an organization, Sobha's core strengths lie in its execution capabilities to deliver superior quality, our track record in consistently exceeding customer expectations, the credibility that comes with our success to date, and the highly professional approach with which our company is run.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy?</h4><p>While Sobha entered the Dubai market in 2005, our most recent efforts have been centered on Sobha Hartland and Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum City — District One, which were launched in 2013. By March 2015, despite a continued softening in Dubai's real estate sector, I felt that the organization had sufficient visibility and confidence to successfully deliver both projects in a timely manner while ensuring that its quality standards would surpass customer expectations. This self-assurance enabled my team and I to evaluate new international markets, which could provide Sobha with a platform for geographic diversification, additional streams of revenue growth, and an ability to elevate and strengthen Sobha as a global brand. Having evaluated several key geographies, London won our confidence. While this was driven by a few factors, of primary importance was the fact that London's residential real estate sector had continued to generate long-term growth and stability, despite market volatility in other major cities worldwide. It was also apparent that the London market would appreciate and welcome the quality standards that Sobha had built its reputation on over the past four decades. We have secured our office location in London's Mayfair area, which represents our first step into the UK market. Sobha's strategy to enter London is predicated on its focus on the luxury residential segment and on primarily executing redevelopment projects through a JV approach. Fortunately, we have identified a well-respected, London-based group with whom we will finalize our JV arrangement. This group has been able to provide us with access to some of London's most preeminent and sought after project locations, where we would be able to leverage our strengths in luxury residential development. Our partnership will be represented under the brand of Sobha Europe, which will serve as the entity through which all UK-based projects will be executed and delivered. To date, with our JV partner, we have identified six redevelopment projects that we plan to enter in 2016. In addition to our UK expansion, we are also in advanced discussions to finalize additional expansion efforts within the UAE. Given the scale of these opportunities, I expect that the UAE, UK, and India markets will provide us with a strong runway for growth over the next 10-15 years. We expect to commence construction in January 2016 and begin delivery of our apartments and villas by mid 2017.</p><h4>How much investor interest is there in this project so far?</h4><p>Based on my experience, Dubai's real estate market tends to experience a two-year positive cycle, followed by a two-year negative cycle. Unfortunately, as we witnessed in 2009, 2010, 2011, and the first half of 2012, Dubai went through a three-and-a-half year negative cycle. I view this as an unusual situation. In hindsight, given the severity of the downturn, the market needed more time to rebound. Dubai's positive cycle began by the second half of 2012 and lasted through mid-2014, during which we experienced two years of sustained growth. By 2H2014, we were once again in a negative cycle. During negative cycles, our sales are typically 20% of what we achieve during a positive cycle. I expect that by 2H2016 we will once again enter a positive cycle. Fortunately, we launched District One during the positive cycle. From a total of four phases, we have launched two phases so far, both of which are nearly sold out. A few villas are still available. We expect to launch phase three in the next 1-2 months.</p><h4>The District One project is a JV with Meydan Group. How did this alliance emerge?</h4><p>Yes, this is a 50-50 JV with Meydan Group. Given my experience of working on prestigious and high-profile projects for the rulers of Oman, the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, and Brunei, there is an extensive track record and familiarity that I have with this region. This experience, coupled with our quality-focused approach, represented a strong synergy with Meydan Group and its requirements. I am extremely pleased and fortunate to have entered into this alliance. The opportunity to work alongside an extremely seasoned and professional group has been invaluable. Both sides have been able to leverage their respective strengths, which is ultimately what all great partnerships should be based on.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the rest of 2015 and what advice would you offer?</h4><p>I expect the remainder of 2015 and first half of 2016 to continue under the current negative cycle. From my perspective, real estate developers should acknowledge the cyclical nature of the industry and avoid the temptation to panic. For those who do not panic, there will be opportunities. I have seen developers over-react too often, especially when they have not implemented a sound financial engineering approach to managing the ups and downs of the market. Proper financial engineering will help developers prepare for the cycles and plan accordingly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was behind the inception of the Lawyers' Council of Thailand over 30 years ago?</h4><p>The Lawyers Council of Thailand separated from the Thai Bar in 1985 because at that time professional lawyers felt strongly that we didn't receive fair treatment under the joint leadership of the President of the Supreme Court, the President of the Court of Appeals, and the Attorney General. In a committee comprised of 27 members, only five of those members were lawyers, meaning we were a minority in that administration and, therefore, we felt unfairly treated. The prominent senior lawyers at that time supported independence and we pushed for the draft Lawyer Act in Parliament from about 1976 to 1985. We finally succeeded in getting the Lawyer Act of 1985 in place. Overall, it took us a while, almost 10 years, to become free and independent. We are now the special juristic person under our own charter designated with the authority of enforcement of professional ethical rules and the promotion and enhancement of the lawyer profession, including welfare, for example. In short, we are the sole authority overseeing the legal practice of all lawyers—over 81,000 attorneys in Thailand—and we are the central organization of all professional lawyers in Thailand. Initially, we were under the Court of Appeals IX for the whole legal profession; however, now we are truly independent. My colleagues and I are elected from lawyers throughout the country, and our term is three years with only two consecutive terms allowed. All 23 of us, including the president, are fully elected through public elections.</p><h4>How has the practice of law evolved over the years in Thailand?</h4><p>When we started our own administration, our biggest issue was that we didn't have any money; therefore, we used our own funding for registration fees and tuition fees, for example. Today, we have invested a great deal into our own construction, $20 million in loans to finance our new office due to be completed in 2016. In our first 10 years, we concentrated on trying to establish more independent and stable legal practices and to raise funding. In terms of practice, most of the legal profession in Thailand is based on litigation, more than 90%. We haven't yet enhanced legal counseling much; however, we are planning about 33 legal counseling courses across all segments. The coming trend of practicing law in Thailand is that we will encourage our professional colleagues to look into future business. We want them to get involved with legal practices in terms of providing legal counseling for all sectors of society, be it finance or sports. Currently, most practices are based on litigation, and more than 60% of that is criminal. I want to encourage branching out from litigation to counseling. We also need to learn and then practice more in English because the official language of ASEAN is English. Thailand was never colonized; therefore, we never really studied or learned English on a large scale.</p><h4>The key purpose of ASEAN is to increase business activity. Do you think legal cases being overwhelmingly criminal will give way to more commercial legal practices and cases?</h4><p>To diversify away from pure litigation law, there are 33 new legal counseling courses across all segments that we are trying to promote. In Thailand, it is unfortunate that we have a lifetime permit when we qualify for the legal profession. Once I am registered, that is it; I don't need to take any more compulsory legal studies, which is a shame because it prevents us from evolving, adapting, learning, and becoming flexible in other forms and areas of law. This is something we are trying to change. We can't do it right now, at least not with the current set of lawyers. The legal counseling market will also have to grow, and this will create a healthier and more dynamic legal sector for Thailand, shifting it from a near complete dedication to litigation.</p><h4>What are your expectations and goals for 2016?</h4><p>We will move into new offices, into which we have invested $20 million. It's about a 7,700sqm office, which is modern and will accommodate 1,000 people, with a 500-person capacity lecture hall. We are the largest single professional association in ASEAN. We need all the space we can get. We will continue to encourage the legal profession to study and diversify more and to take our 33 courses to branch out from litigation and practice in other areas. This will benefit lawyers, their firms, and the country in general.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies have you introduced to deal with the drop in commodity prices?</h4><p>We have had some major shocks to the economy over the last three years. We had disruption to our gas supply for two and a half years, and then the simultaneous fall in cocoa, gold, and crude oil prices, all of which have exposed our vulnerability as we implement our agenda to consolidate our position as a middle-income country. The fall of crude oil prices to a low of $45.0 per barrel compared to a benchmark revenue projection of $99.38 per barrel in the 2015 budget meant that we had to revise revenue targets and related expenditures that were to be funded from the annual budget funding amount. We are monitoring the crude oil prices for 2016 and will do the necessary fiscal adjustments through due process should the need arise.  However, with that in mind, and with the IMF program and our own homegrown policies, there are clear signs that our fiscal consolidation efforts are yielding positive results, making the economy more efficient. Accordingly, the GSS estimates that GDP will come in at 4.1% for 2015 compared to the 3.5% initially projected. The World Bank and IMF estimate future growth above 7%. We are returning to a growth path and our fiscal performance so far clearly shows that we can plan to manage and reverse periodic setbacks and take care of opportunities, as and when they occur.</p><h4>Last year Ghana was issued a Eurobond, with a 10.75% yield demanded. How does that fit into your overall growth strategy?</h4><p>We issued our fourth sovereign bond, which was over-subscribed by $1 billion. The 15-year tenor of the bond is the first by any Sub-Saharan African country besides South Africa. With that, our target is to shift away from short-term debt instruments when financing the capital budget. Instead we will target long-term development projects. This has brought with it the capacity to refinance short-term debts and upcoming sovereign bond debts, as well as the remaining principal of the Eurobond that will mature in 2017. The World Bank has also chosen to back an up to $1 billion refinance component, which is a strong reassurance to the investment community.</p><h4>Public-sector salaries accounted for 72% of government expenditure in 2012 and energy subsidy bills have fuelled fiscal debt. What are the main initiatives being put in place to pull these expenditures under control, boost transparency, and encourage confidence in the economy?</h4><p>The 2015 budget aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit from 10.2% of GDP in 2014 to 6.5%. However, due to the decline in crude oil prices, this target was revised to 7.3% of GDP in the 2015 Mid-Year Review. Since then, as a result of good revenue performance (including GRA's compliance efforts), containment of overruns in the wage bill and other spending, as well as the withdrawal of energy-related subsidies (except funded cross subsidies), our fiscal consolidation program is on course with the deficit set to be on target at 7.3%. Wage containment initiatives such as our collective resolve with public-sector unions to negotiate wage adjustments within budgetary constraints, payroll audits, and other initiatives such as ESV to minimise the incidence of ghost workers and net freeze in recruitment have also contributed in reducing the wages-to-tax revenue ratio of 57.6 % in 2013 to 44.2% in 2015.</p><h4>Looking toward longer-term goals, Ghana will have to improve its debt-to-exports ratio and revenue to exports ratio. What will be the key drivers of this return to economic growth? </h4><p>The national debt and consequent burden of debt service will continue to rise and stunt public investments if we do not emulate the success with which many middle income and advanced countries finance infrastructural, economic, and social development on a sustainable basis. The government therefore has to continue to implement debt management measures. These new measures include on-lending and escrow mechanisms, project based guarantees, channelling concessional financing for social projects and commercial loans for commercial projects, a sinking fund, and refinancing. As a result of these measures, the public debt is now increasing at a slower pace. As part of our transformational agenda to achieve an export-led economy, the Ghana Export and Import Bank Bill has been laid before parliament. The primary purpose is to finance export, notably light industrial and agricultural products, guarantee loans, provide export insurance, support SMEs and other businesses, and strengthen our access to markets. The operations of the Bank will support the nurturing and growth of the private sector in Ghana to address the longstanding problem of access to credit for expanding exports. The 2016 budget was designed to build on a foundation of restructuring and transforming the economy toward sustained and inclusive growth and thus minimize our exposure to volatilities. Furthermore, we expect that the investments by the public and private sectors will permanently transform the sector. These investments, including the World Bank Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) for Sankofa field, commissioning of FPSO J.E.A Mills for the TEN fields, and onset of Jubilee Gas contribute to the positive outlook.</p><h4>With that in mind, where is the government investing in infrastructure and social development in 2016?</h4><p>We have made far-reaching and significant investments in all sectors of the economy and these have led to considerable improvements in the lives of our people. After the success of the ''Schools Under Trees Programme,'' we began the construction of 123 Community Day Senior High Schools to provide space for hundreds of thousands of JHS graduates. We have also added two new functioning universities. In health, we have a massive infrastructure development project ongoing for the construction of new hospitals, including the nearly completed University of Ghana Teaching Hospital and the Ridge Hospital. These will deliver about 6,000 hospital beds by 2017. We have also invested heavily in road infrastructure, and launched the GHC3 billion Cocoa Road Improvement Project. There are also substantial investments in aviation and maritime infrastructure, both of which are designed on a self-financing basis. Not only are these investments critical to social service provision, but have also provided tens of thousands of jobs.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016? </h4><p>Based on our medium-term macroeconomic framework, our targets are an average real GDP (including oil) growth rate of at least 8.2% and an average non-oil real GDP growth rate of 6.9%. Our inflation target is 8% with a band of ±2% and, by 2018, if all measures are implemented will result, in the medium-term, in an overall budget deficit of 3%. In 2016 we seek to achieve a GDP growth rate of 5.4%, a fiscal deficit of 5.3% of GDP, and accumulate gross international reserves to cover at least three months of imports of goods and services. Key to achieving the fiscal deficit target include the implementation of the 2015 Income Tax Act (Act 896), the implementation of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff, and realignment of the Statutory Funds. International trade taxes are estimated at GH¢6.5 billion or 4.1% of GDP and 21.7% of total tax revenue. The estimate reflects a 19.5% increase over the projected outturn for 2015. The increase is expected to be largely driven by a growth in import duties of 33.7% due partly to the impact of the implementation of the ECOWAS Common External Tariff.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Ruta del Sol project evolved over the last year?</h4><p>The project is going well and as planned. We expect to finish it by the end of 2018. In November 2015, we completed a crucial phase—a 120-km dual carriageway with a new highway built and the old road rehabilitated. Considering the original seven contractual sections, we have the priority sections 1, 5, and 6 completely done, delivered, and in the O&amp;M phase.</p><h4>Another of your landmark projects in Colombia is improving the navigability of the Magdalena River. How is that project progressing?</h4><p>We are dealing now with the pre-construction phase of the project and we'll have until mid-2016 to complete it. We initially took over control of the river in June 2015 and we were affected by the drought in the region. However, we managed to maintain navigability in the river and we have also undertaken the financial side of the project, which we expect to have completed by March 2016. The project foresees five years of construction, but we expect to complete it in four years. This is a rather short-term project that presents a 13½-year concession between pre-construction and construction activity. We foresee intelligent dredging in the river, especially between Barrancabermeja and Puerto Salgar, which are key areas for project feasibility. We looked at projects like the Rhine in Germany to develop something similar in Colombia.</p><h4>How are you working to minimalize the environmental impact on the river?</h4><p>Environmental issues concerning the project are almost non-existent on the Magdalena River. The licensing for this project is also less bureaucratic and we are expecting minimum social challenges as well. We have been doing maintenance works on the river and the navigable channel since the first day when we assumed control. We will work on 150 breakwaters that will have no affect on villages or towns along the river—we are committed to having no social or environmental impact.</p><h4>In your opinion, how important are public private partnerships (PPP) when it comes to boosting the infrastructure development of the country?</h4><p>The PPP law in Colombia is one of the best in the world—it is very clear in terms of the contribution of the state, the commitment of private institutions, and so on. In the current environment, with the devaluation of the Colombian peso and the dropping of oil prices, private companies can bring the cash and investment that public institutions currently lack. In other words, we can compensate the current situation and the government understands that. For example, we proposed a public transport project related to Transmilenio in the Boyaca Avenue, in Bogotá, which would be financed by funds from private drivers. However, the proposal seems to have been diluted between other priorities for the local authorities, as well as the local elections, and we hope to give it a boost during 2016.</p><h4>Is the company interested in developing projects in other cities outside Bogotá?</h4><p>We are considering potential projects in Barranquilla, Cartagena and in the adjacent area. There we would be interested in projects related to traffic management. Cartagena and Barranquilla, among other towns in the country, are also cities where we could develop urban mobility projects. We have a great deal of knowledge and expertise in this field and we see potential projects for the future similar to the Bogotá Metro and the Transmilenio expansion, which are complementary rather than incompatible. In terms of the Bogotá Metro project, there is plenty of financial support, but there are still some key elements that need to be clarified by local authorities. This is a great project that needs the development of other transport infrastructure projects. Now that the local elections are over, we will be hearing from the council of Bogotá on this and other projects and we will make sure that we will participate in important projects for the city. We aim to boost transport and urban mobility by strengthening public transport systems across Colombia, so people are encouraged to use public transport rather than their private vehicles.</p><h4>What other sectors offer great potential to you?</h4><p>We can take an active part in the energy projects the government wants to boost. There is a lack of energy infrastructure along the coast and we could offer a lot of alternatives as solutions. Water recycling systems and sewage water projects are also areas in which there is a lot to be done in Colombia. Water is the main challenge in the 21st century, and Odebrecht can positively affect Colombia's development in that regard. The water tariff culture in the country must change. We also see a lot of potential in the agribusiness industry.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in 2017, the year in which you will commemorate your 25th anniversary in Colombia?</h4><p>We are among the top 10 construction companies in Colombia. We want to be among the top five. In addition, we want to become the most attractive company for young people to work for when finishing their studies. We want to further help Colombia develop its infrastructure and be ready to take on future challenges associated to its continuous growth and development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Azerbaijan experiences some domestic economic difficulties, what are the pillars of Azerbaijan's foreign policy that support the country on an international level?</h4><p>Over the years, the foreign economic policy of the Republic of Azerbaijan has been guided by five pillars, namely strengthening trans-regional energy, ICT, and transport connectivity, attracting FDI, and the preservation of economic security, effectively integrating local SMEs into global value chains and increasing the exports of national competitive products to foreign strategic markets. By acknowledging the role of international trade in achieving sustainable, balanced, and robust growth, our national development strategy is based on the improvement of trade legislation, trade facilitation, simplification of customs procedures, expansion of bilateral, regional, and multilateral cooperation, the diversification of our export structure, and the promotion of non-oil exports. We are working on developing a policy that facilitates trade, simplifies non-tariff barriers, and increases the competitiveness of local SMEs. Recognizing the importance of trade facilitation, we have recently established the Transit Cargo Coordination Council to elaborate a uniform, efficient, and transparent tariff policy in rail and maritime cargo transportation and to facilitate the process of cargo shipping. We believe that these measures will significantly contribute to boosting trans-regional trade. During the past 10 years, the number of our trading partners reached 150, we signed more than 60 bilateral trade and economic partnership agreements, the country's external trade increased by 4.3 times, including six fold in exports, and by 2.6 times in imports. Over the past decade, the poverty rate has declined in Azerbaijan from 50% in 2001 to 5% in 2015. Our unemployment rate today stands at 4.9%. Azerbaijan is implementing a number of industry and trade-related measures aimed at promoting a more favorable environment for local and foreign businessmen. In 2015, we registered a positive economic performance and economic growth in the non-oil sector stood at 8.4%. </p><h4>In your address to the UN General Assembly in September 2015, you spoke about Azerbaijan in the context of the global economy. How has Azerbaijan's role in the international arena expanded as a result of transnational pipelines and other infrastructure projects like TASIM and the BTK railway?</h4><p>Integration in the global economy has been at the core of Azerbaijan's foreign economic policy. Azerbaijan is committed and is currently the only country producing for the establishment of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC), which will play substantial role in the diversification of natural gas suppliers to Europe. Two important projects, the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP) and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP), are now being implemented within the framework of the SGC, which has the potential to meet up to 20% of Europe's gas needs in the future. Energy infrastructure projects have significantly strengthened Azerbaijan's relationship with our close partners and intensified the regional cooperation with Turkey and Georgia, which has yielded remarkable results in other fields as well. Azerbaijan also actively participates in the advancement of important transcontinental transport corridors by investing in the transport infrastructure projects, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway and the New Baku International Sea Port. The BTK railroad, which is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2016 or early 2017, is designed to enhance the transit capacity of Azerbaijan and increase trade flows across the region. The BTK railway will be another step in positioning the South Caucasus as a major transit route between Europe and Asia. In addition, Azerbaijan has initiated the Trans-Eurasian Information Super Highway (TASIM) as a major regional initiative aimed at the creation of a transnational fiber-optic backbone, targeting primarily the countries of Eurasia from Western Europe to Eastern Asia. This project envisages building a major new transit route from Frankfurt to Hong Kong, contributing to the creation of an open information society, increasing internet speed, and developing new internet services. Azerbaijan has been continuously proactive in its promotion of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation among partner countries by initiating and supporting all potential projects aimed at the development of not only Azerbaijan, but the wider region as well.</p><h4>With the current tension between Russia and Turkey, how important is it to Azerbaijan to maintain strong relations with both countries?</h4><p>Relations are being dynamically developed in almost all fields of cooperation with both Turkey and Russia, and Azerbaijan places a particular emphasis on deepening its ties with both countries. Azerbaijan's relationship with Turkey, as a strategic ally, and with Russia, as a strategic partner, has historic roots and the volume of signed documents, as well as regular mutual visits, is further proof of strong relations. Regrettably, the fighter jet incident has negatively affected the relations between the two countries. The current state of the relationship between Russia and Turkey is in no way desirable for Azerbaijan. Needless to say, both Turkey and Russia play an important role in maintaining the security and stability in the South Caucasus region and beyond. Azerbaijan remains interested in enhancing its relationship with both countries by all possible means. We hope that, as a result of joint efforts, the relations between Turkey and Russia will be normalized through dialogue and mutual understanding.</p><h4>Following your visit to Panama and Costa Rica's announcement to open an embassy in Azerbaijan, how would you characterize Azerbaijan's relations with Central America?</h4><p>The development of relations with Central America, and in a broader context Latin America, is of significant importance to Azerbaijan's foreign policy. The political relations with Central and Latin American countries have been rapidly developing over the last few years. Cuba, Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, and Mexico have recently opened their embassies in Azerbaijan. Along with our embassies in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Cuba, we have recently established diplomatic missions in Columbia, Peru, Uruguay, and Chile. Further proof of good political relations, Azerbaijan obtained large support from Latin American countries when it became a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council. My visit to Panama, the visit of Costa Rica's Foreign Minister, the visits from Deputy Foreign Ministers of Argentina and Uruguay last year, and the announcement of Costa Rica to establish an embassy in Azerbaijan are all vivid examples of the intensification of relations between Azerbaijan and the countries of the region. Trade and economic cooperation are paramount in our relations. The trade turnover between Azerbaijan and Latin American countries was approximately $300 million in 2014. Azerbaijan will continue to work closely with its Latin and Central American partners toward the further promotion of friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><h4>How does hosting large-scale international events like the Formula One Grand Prix help advance Azerbaijan in the international arena?</h4><p>We consider our country's cultural diversity as a strength and advantage, which gives us ample opportunity to contribute to the promotion of intercultural dialogue and understanding. Sport plays a vital role in this respect, uniting people and countries. More than 300 international sport events have been held in Azerbaijan in last 12 years. In 2015, Azerbaijan successfully hosted the First European Games and we earned 56 medals in total, finishing in second place after Russia. These games, as well as the IV Islamic Solidarity Games, which will be held in Baku in May 2017, demonstrate Azerbaijan's promotion of the ideas of cultural diversity, tolerance, and peace as the universal principles of sport. It is not a coincidence that our country was selected as a host for the next Formula One Grand Prix. We are proud of hosting such a prestigious tournament and will do our best to ensure it is organized and conducted at the highest level. We hope that the race participants, guests, and tourists will be able to familiarize themselves with our beautiful country, its ancient culture, history, and tradition, and enjoy our hospitality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PROINVEX was created as agency for investment and export promotion. What features of Panama do you highlight to the international investor community?</h4><p>Panama offers a competitive logistics platform through sea, air, land, and railway, linking the two seas between Panama City and Colón. The country features a service-based economy that accounted for 72% of GDP as of September 2015. Panama's sustainable economy was able to grow 6.2% in the last 10 years, even during the financial crisis. As a dollarized economy with three quarters of GDP coming from the service sector, the effects of fluctuations in international commodities prices on surrounding markets do not impact Panama as hard as export-oriented economies. The financial system has, over the last decade, shown strong figures due to wise policies regarding credit loans and procedures.</p><h4>Panama has taken measures to come off the FTFA's grey list. Do you think this has acted as a deterrent to investment in the financial sector, and what are other barriers to FDI that need to be overcome?</h4><p>Financial sectors across the world face challenges regarding the financing of terrorist activities and money laundering. Panama has taken the right steps to solve this problem and erase the image of a fiscal paradise. The government has modified Law 47 of 2013, creating a system of custody of bearer shares. The standard is to always know who is the ultimate beneficiary of the securities of any given company. Panama's message to international investors is directly linked to it being a transparent financial system, and recent efforts have proven that we are on the right path. In numbers, the International Banking Center recorded more than $115 billion in assets and $1.2 billion in profits by September of this year. Competitiveness in financial systems has experienced worldwide crisis, but general figures have prevailed solid and investor confidence is still growing despite the international crisis. Panama has free conversion of foreign exchange and no restriction to capital inflows and outflows, with multiple incentive laws that together create an attractive scenario for investments.</p><h4>Which products contribute the most to Panama's export revenues, and what can these industries do to move up the value chain?</h4><p>The top 10 export products from Panama as of 3Q2015 hold a strong concentration in total exports. Fresh bananas account for 13.2% of total exports and represent an FOB value of $70.9 million. Cold water prawns and shrimps of cold water account for 8% of exports, while other fresh or refrigerated salmonids account for 4.3% and raw sugar cane contributes 3.6%. Fish flour and pellets, iron and steel scraps, and fresh or dried pineapple contribute 3.2%, 3.2%, and 3.1% respectively. Wood accounts for 3% of export value, fresh watermelon 2.6%, and medicines for therapeutic use 2.6%. Total exports in 3Q2015 amounted to $536.2 million. The value-added industry for Panamanian products is the right approach to increase productiveness. There are also other non-traditional products that can generate excellent income for local producers or foreign investors. Panama has the climate for the production of cocoa, with an excellent perspective on the international market. The yellow fin tuna is another good example, due to several studies by Japanese researchers whose conclusions detail that Panama's Atlantic shores are ideal for developing an aquaculture project. This fish is highly demanded in Asia at a high price. Pineapples can be raised year-round, and their sweetness grade is the best in Latin America and the Caribbean. These are just a few examples of case studies showing how FDI can be brought into Panama and create an industry for those agricultural products that were traditionally exported raw.</p><h4>Panama has a number of special economic areas offering fiscal and other incentives. How much of an impact have they had in pushing forward the goals of PROINVEX and what can be done to prompt the Colón Free Trade Zone?</h4><p>PROINVEX's goals are directly linked to the promotion of all incentive laws and special economic areas through Panama Invest events around the world that showcase Panama's attractiveness to investors. The purpose is to create a direct link between top government institutions depending on the previous selected economic sectors and the potential investors in the country of destination. With regards to the Colón Free Zone, the answer is market diversification. Over the decades, entrepreneurs created solid business relations with countries such as Venezuela and Colombia. Both countries are facing social and economic struggles. The value of the US dollar has been increasing against Latin American currencies, which makes it expensive for buyers to maintain their same level of consumption. As a result, sales are decreasing. The answer relies on both the government and private sector. On the one hand, the government must create the conditions for entrepreneurs to expand into other markets within Latin America and the Caribbean, and make adjustments to the 1948 Colón Free Zone Law. Participating in international events as buyers is relevant to creating awareness in new markets or expanding other products in traditional markets. The government will create a new law called Colón Free Port. According to law project 222, which establishes the special system of free port, companies pay no tax for materials, machinery, raw materials, tools, and other inputs required for special operations in the free port system, which are limited to the so-called “16 streets of Colon." Other components establish that people can buy up to $1,000 per semester. It also states that vacant lots and other properties used for this purpose and their owners must invest, restore, or rebuild in a period not exceeding five years from the effective date of the law.</p><h4>What events do you have coming up in 2016?</h4><p>We have more than 10 Panama Invest events planned for 2016. We are coordinating at this moment INVEST in Barcelona, Madrid, Korea, Japan, and others. In addition, we will participate for the first time with Expo Invest, a new platform to bring investors to Panama, as well as other events in partnership with the Chamber of Commerce. We are expecting a further 100 companies to establish their headquarters in Panama within the next five years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What led to the establishment of the National Fund in Kuwait, and how important is it that Kuwait support SMEs at the national level?<br></h4><p>There has been considerable talk globally about developing entrepreneurship and addressing the issue of how nations can give SMEs a central role in their economies. We see in advanced economies, as well as emerging markets, that SMEs make up between 70-90% of economic contribution and job creation. Thus, wealth and job creation typically come from SMEs. The question then becomes how can we best support SMEs and what areas do we focus on? We know for sure that SMEs must be part of the larger value-chain. In 2013, the Kuwaiti government passed a law attempting to address all the issues that SMEs face, beyond financing alone. Out of this legislation came the National Fund, where  we are also responsible for developing entrepreneurship in Kuwait. In improving the local ecosystem for SMEs, we work closely with the Kuwait Direct Investment Promotion Authority (KDIPA) to enhance the business environment in Kuwait for companies, covering licenses, labor, minimum capital requirements, locations, and operations. One of the biggest challenges we face in our region, as do some Asian countries in their domestic market as well, is that failure is unacceptable. However, thinking outside the box and creating new and innovative business ideas that have the potential to succeed, inherently carries the risk of failure by definition. Changing the culture requires policymakers in government; leaders in the private sector; and entrepreneurs themselves to think differently. Banks, for example, are not willing to lend money to businesses with high risk. If financial institutions don't provide access to capital for SMEs, and governments are relegated to a purely regulatory role, then we have to recognize the incompatibility of our basic economic assumptions. This is where governments, represented by the National Fund in this case, come in. As a country and as a government, we now see the rewards and are willing to accommodate and manage the risks involved, supporting the incubation of both ideas and individuals.</p><h4>What are the main barriers for SMEs in Kuwait?</h4><p>We are collecting data about SMEs and will eventually establish an information center that will serve as the central point for all information related to SMEs. In the meantime, we undertook a survey as part of formulating our strategy and five-year plan where we worked with the World Bank, independent international experts, government institutions, and more than 70 entrepreneurs and stakeholders from Kuwait. Most participants highlighted that acquiring commercial licenses is the number-one obstacle, as well as acquiring the relevant permission to operate their businesses here. Therefore, we are reviewing all the legislation, regulations, and policies that govern the market to see which of them need to be revised. One of the positive outcomes was the reduction of the minimum capital requirements in April 2015. According to our survey, the second obstacle for SMEs is labor, while access to financing came in at number three.</p><h4>What services does the National Fund provide to entrepreneurs in Kuwait?</h4><p>Based on gaps we see in the market, we divide our services between financial and non-financial support. The financial support comes in the form of either debt or equity, ranging from seed capital to later-stage growth financing. Ideally we should not provide venture capital, but the private sector is not doing this, so  we must address this gap. Debt support comes either directly from us or in collaboration with local banks. These conditions are different, however, because banks are traditionally hesitant to finance a company in its initial years of operation. Banks want financial evidence proving that a company has low risk. Seed capital comes in smaller amounts, so it is an easier form of finance. In terms of non-financial help, this ranges from someone coming to us without an idea to take general or specific training about how to develop an idea, to a more-advanced idea in a specific sector or industry that needs support to develop, test, pilot, and launch. Entrepreneurs have to look at the immediate GCC as their primary market, and then beyond that—regionally and globally—for their wider market. And  with this comes the importance of greater competitiveness.</p><h4>How does the National Fund collaborate with regional and international organizations?</h4><p>We have already signed agreements with various countries that are well known for implementing successful policies and programs to develop SMEs. Our regional partner is the Khalifa Fund for Enterprise Development (KFED) in Abu Dhabi, which is leading efforts towards a possible federal law for the UAE, adopted from Kuwait's National Fund law in terms of the requirements and structure. We are also working with KFED at the institutional level. We are similar to the Emiratis in our culture and demographics, and we face many common issues in economic development. We have done the same at the global level with the Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) from South Korea. Part of that involves exchanging data, information, and learning at the institutional level as well as by individual entrepreneurs. This relationship is also about opening doors for businesses. The SMBA can help our businesses access South Korean markets, and vice-versa. At the invitation of the United Kingdom government, I gave a keynote speech in 4Q2015 at the Commonwealth Business Forum in Malta on entrepreneurship development, SME growth, common challenges, and the Kuwait experience. This forum included 73 countries. Regionally and internationally, other countries are recognizing what we are doing in Kuwait. They recognize that it is a tough job, but it has to be done, and they commend Kuwait for doing it.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Given that we are trying to change a culture and a mindset, we realize that in the first years as a Fund our key performance indicators should not depend solely on the number of projects we finance or the amount of capital invested. What is important for us at this stage is the number of people with whom we engage. This includes holding events that nurture the right attitudes. We will also utilize regional and international mentors to work with entrepreneurs and provide them with the right motivation and explore their skills. The second factor is training, both general  and specialized. We started the Kauffman FastTrac Program in November 2015 and will continue to do this every two to three months. This, together with our other training programs, helps create a business pipeline for the future through the people we train and qualify. Participants come out of the process with a detailed business plan in hand. This is different from just a feasibility study. It is not only about making money; we need a business plan to show why there is an added-value proposition in our concept, and why we should all believe in it to achieve the objectives of our economic and human development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Americana Group and its operations in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Since its inception in Kuwait back in 1964, Americana Group has grown into one of the largest and most successful corporations in the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia region. Americana Group's main lines of business are operating food and beverage outlets, as well as manufacturing food products. With a network of over 1,550 outlets, it is not only the largest operator of restaurant chains in the region, but also one of the most successful franchise operators in the whole world. We commenced our operations in Kazakhstan in 2008 with the purchase of an existing fast food company called Rostik's, which consisted of two stores in Almaty and Astana. Rostik's was a fried chicken brand and, in 2010, we re-branded it to KFC. In 2009, we had also brought Pizza Hut to Kazakhstan for the first time with our restaurant in Almaty. In 2011 we brought Hardee's to Kazakhstan, and then we introduced Costa Coffee in 2012. Today, we have almost 50 restaurants and nearly 2,000 employees. We have worked mainly in Almaty and Astana. In 2015, we are opening in two new cities in Karaganda and the Pavlodar Provinces, and in 2016 we intend to open stores in Aktau and Atyrau.</p><h4>Four out of the 12 brands that Americana Group operates internationally are present in Kazakhstan. Do you think there is demand for more brands to come here?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity for new brands, as Kazakhstan is still a virgin market compared to the Gulf. There are hundreds of international brands in the Emirates now, while there are less than 10 global brands operating in Kazakhstan's food industry. This provides a huge opportunity for growth. The Kazakhstani customer is unique. They had few choices and ate a limited range of products during Soviet times. There is now an opportunity for businesses to provide customers with something novel and desirable. We estimate that the influence of price on a customer's decision to return to a restaurant is less than 13% in Kazakhstan. In fact, our research indicates that Kazakhstani customers are the least affected by price across all of our market segments. They care more about service and quality, and new market players should focus on these two factors.</p><h4>Do you have any specific brands in mind for Kazakhstan?</h4><p>We were supposed to bring in some additional brands in 2015. However, we decided to first grow our existing brands here in order to ensure that they were stable before bringing in new brands. We decided to postpone the introduction of new brands to allow for the preparation of the right infrastructure and caliber of people to work with these brands. We have, however, brought in our sister company, Cairo Poultry, which specializes in chicken and beef processing. Without this in place, our new brands would lack adequate supplies, as we are not able to import everything required. We operate the Red Lobster brand in the Middle East, but it would be difficult to import lobsters into Kazakhstan. Therefore, we first have to analyze how we can supply our restaurants with the right raw materials. In 2013, Kazakhstan's contribution to total revenues was around 3%. We are still growing, and Kazakhstan is one of the markets with the most potential for Americana Group.</p><h4>As a Kuwaiti company, Americana Group is listed on the Kuwait Stock Exchange and you have also become established locally in Kazakhstan. What potential do you see for other GCC investors to establish operations here?</h4><p>There is a huge opportunity here for GCC investors and several have come in recently. Four years ago, the Zara and Massimo Dutti brands arrived. Now we have heard that Starbucks is coming via a Kuwaiti company. We have also seen a lot of investment in Astana coming from the Abu Dhabi government. There is considerable interest from GCC countries in Kazakhstan and it is continually growing. Many companies in the agricultural sector are also planning to launch operations here soon. This is because the government has recently been putting in place new procedures to attract foreign investment. These incentives include low-rate loans, reproducible returns on investment as high as 30%, and available infrastructure for all companies to utilize.</p><h4>The 12 brands that you represent are highly renowned around the world, including some of the largest fast food brands, as well as fine dining restaurants. How does Americana Group plan to attract more brands globally?</h4><p>Americana Group has an extensive history in the fast food market. We have managed to build a great reputation in developing and operating more than 1,000 restaurants over a period of more than 50 years. It is important for any franchiser that cares about brand reputation to only enter into partnerships with responsible partners. With our reputation, we have what every potential partner is looking for and it is by leveraging this reputation that we are able to work with any brand. That said, our shareholders and chairman usually pursue a balanced portfolio. In Kazakhstan, we have KFC as our chicken brand, Hardee's as our burger chain, Pizza Hut as our pizza brand, and Costa Coffee as our coffee operation. There is an intentional line of thinking in place to minimize cannibalization between our lines of business. We try to build a portfolio with a fundamental variety of brands.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>It looks like 2016 will be a challenging year because of the economic situation and because of added competition entering the market. However, our expectation is that we can make significant progress and improvements in the company itself. We are still focusing on being the number one brand for quality and service, for which we won an award in 2014. We invest a great deal in our people. We have already started to expand outside of the traditional boundaries of Almaty and Astana, presenting us with an opportunity for significant growth in an area that could be called a virgin market, with little to no existing competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the performance of Qatar's tourism sector and its role in Qatar's economy as a whole?</h4><p>Tourism is a major catalyst for Qatar's socio-economic growth. Not only does it contribute to expanding the economy, attracting investors, and creating jobs, it also supports the development of a national brand on the international stage, encouraging intellectual dialogue and the breaking down of barriers between peoples around the world. In a country heavily reliant on its hydrocarbon wealth, tourism is playing a pivotal role in diversifying Qatar's economy, in turn shielding it from market infatuations that can impact its growth and sustainability in the long term. Last year once again showed promising results for Qatar's tourism sector. The numbers of both international and regional visitors have been on the rise. Visitors' numbers from the neighboring GCC markets have increased. This follows the establishment of QTA's GCC representative office there in 2014 and reflects the various trade and consumer-centric joint promotions, the Qatar annual calendar of festivals, events, and other initiatives launched to attract visitors. Moreover, the country witnessed a rise in overall hotel occupancy due to the various events, festivals, and conferences taking place. All in all, these positive results put Qatar on track in helping it achieve its goal of 7 million visitors by 2030. </p><h4>Describe the way that QTA interfaces with private sector industry stakeholders to support and develop this important sector?</h4><p>As the custodian and regulator of the tourism industry in Qatar, an industry that encompasses a wide range of stakeholders, both from the public sector and the private sector, as well as civil society, QTA has been successfully coordinating with different entities on the development and implementation of various programs, projects, and regulations. For example, The National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 was developed following a nation-wide consultative process through which QTA was able to gather the input and feedback for a wide range of stakeholders that contributed to its successful development, be they ministries, public entities, policy advocating bodies, private-sector entities, industry professionals, or journalists and opinion leaders. The Strategy also took into account the need to ensure that the type of tourism that it will promote will be fully in line and will respect local traditions and local norms. Another example is our latest partnership with Qatar Development Bank (QDB) and its incubation center (QBIC) to provide QBIC Tourism, a specialized incubator that will enable entrepreneurs to develop products and services to enhance the Qatar tourism experience by providing them with unique tools and access guidance and feedback from decision-makers and mentors. Through QBIC Tourism, QTA will provide guidance to entrepreneurs to support them as they introduce creative business ideas to the market that enrich visitors experience across various areas, including business events, luxury and leisure, culture and heritage products, and family recreation.</p><h4>How would you describe QTA's strategic approach toward attracting international visitors and which regions of the world pose the most opportunity for growth?</h4><p>The guiding principle behind Qatar's tourism development strategy is quality, authenticity, and sustainability. We place top priority on ensuring that tourism growth is fully compatible with Qatar's cultural, social, and environmental integrity. We aim to build on our traditional strengths in the GCC leisure market and in business tourism, while placing increased emphasis on diversifying into new areas, with a focus on the major European source markets such as the UK, Germany, France, and Italy. That said, we will also continue to focus on the rapidly emerging markets of China, the Far East, and India, and have plans to penetrate these regions within the coming years. To complement our market focus, we are mindful of specific segments that cross geographical boundaries as identified in Qatar National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030. A major target group, namely those that embrace sophisticated, experienced travelers actively seeking new cultural experiences and families, whether from neighboring countries or overseas, are strategically considered in all areas of tourism development. We further remain interested in niche markets including special sports tourism, culture, and education. Qatar's Aspire Zone has an outstanding infrastructure for all types of sports-related tourism, including winter training camps and pre-tournament coaching and team building initiatives. With its extensive purpose-built indoor and outdoor training facilities, sports medicine clinics, sports academics, and all the other support services, the zone offers an ideal environment to attract this healthy type of business. Aspire Zone complements the many world class sporting infrastructure in place.</p><h4>The MICE and business sector is an important proposition within the QTA strategic focus. What is your view on the growth potential of this sector with the development of state-of-the-art venue/facilities that Qatar offers?</h4><p>Qatar is solidly carving for itself a place on the global map as a premium destination for business events. With the country's plans to increase the number of visitors by 20% within the next five years, we believe that developing a strong business events sector will help the country achieve these numbers, and will enhance Qatar's ability to develop a sustainable tourism sector. In 2015, the number of exhibitions rose by 40% with Qatar hosting 50 exhibitions in different sectors including fashion, real estate, education, and medicine. We expect another rise in the number of exhibition to reach 85 exhibitions and a rise in visitors by 5% in the coming year. The success that the business events sector has been enjoying is due to the luxurious, first-class, state-of-the-art venues available in Qatar. In the coming months, the new Doha Exhibition center will be opening its doors to all event organizers and will host its first event in November 2015. These numbers show us that our strategy to triple the number of visitors to Qatar by 2030 is well underway and that 2016 will see more efforts en route to achieving this aim.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming period?</h4><p>The National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 will help expand and reinforce the tourism sector in a way to allow the country to continue on its path of development well into the future. In this regard, the strategy will promote a greater role for the private sector in spearheading tourism related initiatives and plans, will enhance the country's tourism human capital through specialized academic and training programs, and will ensure that all tourism promotional efforts are well-targeted and rolled out in a well-planned manner according to unambiguous and quantifiable parameters. Furthermore, the strategy will provide a clear direction on the future of the industry in Qatar, as well as offer a series of regulations that can empower and render the tourism sector more competitive, benefiting the industry as a whole. Furthermore, the National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 sets clear targets and objectives to achieve by 2030, whether in terms of the numbers of tourists that Qatar can expect and their breakdown and distribution, the number of hotel rooms to be made available, the number of jobs to be created, the contribution of the tourism sector to the country's GDP, or the planned projects to be set across all areas of Qatar, including the 25 high impact programs already identified in the strategy.  Many of the programs and projects set in the National Tourism Sector Strategy 2030 will have a long-term positive implications on Qatar and all Qataris. But at the same time, the strategy will also have short and medium-term objectives that will allow Qataris to feel a real difference in their daily lives within a relatively short time span, whether in terms of greater opportunities for leisure and entertainment, an improved infrastructure, more hotels and restaurants, and increased global awareness of Qatar's rich cultural heritage and traditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify in the energy sector in Nigeria when you entered the market?</h4><p>I graduated in Petroleum Engineering in 1980 and having worked for two US oil companies—Kerr-McGee and Texaco—and gained valuable experience. I decided to foray into the Nigerian business environment in 1988 because at that time opportunities existed for Nigerians to get into the oil and gas sector. The PAI Group was, therefore, conceptualized in 1989 primarily as a procurement company of which we were agents for the US based safety shoe manufacturing company Red Wings. After five years, the company evolved into a service support company for internationally renowned companies with interest in Nigeria. The portfolio of 12 companies ranged from FMC, SOFEC, Samsung Heavy Industries, Air-Logistics, Dateline Services, LTT, Tubing Testers, and a host of others. PAI, therefore, became the local strategic partner to these international service companies providing local infrastructures, human resources and business support. Approximately five years later with the experience gained, PAI forayed into acquisition and in 2000 acquired Transcoastal, a US-based company with operations in Nigeria in the fabrication and offshore construction business. The company was awarded a three-year fabrication contract by Chevron and successfully fabricated four offshore platforms and five helidecks of which we are proud to say those platforms are still producing oil offshore here in Nigeria. Without a doubt Transcostal prides itself as the trailblazer of Nigeria content, of which the Nigeria Content Act was passed into law in 2012. PAI moved into another acquisition when we bought the internationally recognized pipe coating company Bredero Price based in Nigeria, which we grew significantly. We have continued on an acquisition spree and recently concluded the acquisition of Ascot, which is a well-known company with the largest fabrication yards in West Africa with capabilities for offshore construction, marine fleet, heavy equipment, pipe coating plants, and calm buoy docks within the facility. This facility has the ability to fabricate heavy structures up to 10,000 tons.</p><h4>What do you plan to do with the Ascot facilities?</h4><p>There is significant potential with Ascot. The facility has the ability to build offshore platforms and decks including calm buoys. We are in dialogue with various international partners in their areas of expertise where we have the infrastructure to support them. The facility will offer minimal entry costs for these companies because we have a functional base. We have pipe coating, a marine division, a dredging division, and we also have the ability to do onshore pipeline construction as well. That facility, therefore, covers the entire spectrum of our construction business. We are looking for more international partners to develop strategic relationships in order to grow into a full EPICC company of choice in Nigeria.</p><h4>How have your foreign partners reacted to the new Buhari administration?</h4><p>The reaction is positive, because they could see that there is a serious sense of purpose from the present administration; however, there was also the cautiousness that is expected during the infancy stage of a government. It is early days. Now that ministers have portfolios, policies will start coming into place and that will start driving the economy—2016 will be a much better year, and a defining moment for the new administration.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016 in terms of your business and the country as a whole?</h4><p>Since Nigeria's economy is dependent on oil, it is a sticky situation. If oil prices increase, it would be a good thing for the country; however, if the prices stay as-is, the country will have to stay with conservative policies. The administration has come in to try to cut excess costs, which will help save money for the country, but if oil prices stay at the same levels, it will be difficult for them to go into robust projects and fund change. Also, the fiscal policies have not yet been cast, but if they are a lot more lenient and liberal, that will attract investors. For the oil and gas industry, this is a time for injecting creativity into project execution with the aim of cutting cost; that is the motto and goal of our company at this time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Huawei play in the Ghanaian ICT market?</h4><p>Huawei Ghana has been in the local market for 10 years since its founding in 2005. We have developed three lines of business, the first being our public sector operations, through which we cooperate with the Ministry of Communication, the Ministry of Energy, and numerous other government entities. Our second line of business is in the private sector, working with corporate clients and operators, including MTN, Vodafone, Airtel, Tigo, Glo, and even new operators such as Blu and Surfline. Our final line of business is in the new products segment of the market, such as smartphones and devices.</p><h4>How is Huawei working with the Ministry of Communication to develop the National Data Centre?</h4><p>The National Data Centre is a large project and is part of our e-government project. The center is a modern and high-quality design with a huge capacity. It is of similar quality to data centers in China, Europe, and the Middle East. The center currently has services for public-sector use, such as the National Clearing House Project, which will be putting most of its functions into this data center. We also want to develop commercial applications for the center. We are inviting Surfline, and perhaps other operators and related services providers (RSP) in the future, to store some of their applications and services on the data center's server. In the near future, there will be other applications for other ministries, including the Ministry of Employment and Labour Relations and the Ministry of Finance. I hope that in the next one or two years this center can provide services to both the public and private sectors.</p><h4>How long has this project taken and when is it expected to be completed?</h4><p>The data center is complete now and has already been put into use by the National Clearing House Project. In the next one to two months, the functions from Surfline are going to be put into use in the data center. There is a back-up center in Kumasi as well. This additional security exists because this will be the national system for data storage; this data needs to be 100% protected.</p><h4>Can you tell us more about your work with Surfline to roll out Phase II of its LTE/4G capacity?</h4><p>We have demonstrated reliability, cooperation, and advanced technology, and that is why Surfline chose Huawei as its strategic partner for Phase II. Surfline is using us as the supplier of Phase II equipment, as the maintenance service provider, and as the ITO for the whole network. By the end of 2015, we are going to launch some services in Kumasi. Until now, Surfline has only launched 4G services in Accra, so there is a huge demand for the service in Kumasi as well. We should have approximately 40 4G sites available in Kumasi by the beginning of 2016.</p><h4>Are you looking for more infrastructure projects with the government in the future?</h4><p>We use our global experience, financing, and professional expertise to bring more value to the government to increase the level of ICT in Ghana. In 2015 we introduced our Seeds for the Future Program to Ghana. Every year under this program we will invite 15 college-age students from Ghana to come to China for one month of training in the latest ICT technology, as well as having a valuable intercultural experience. They will bring that latest technology back to Ghana. Huawei has also donated four ICT laboratories to universities in Ghana, namely the University of Ghana, Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, the University of Cape Coast, and the University for Development Studies (UDS). This will allow university students to be trained using the latest technology, because we want to help improve the level of education here.</p><h4>Do you think that Huawei's extensive international experience, particularly in Africa, helps you form partnerships here?</h4><p>We grew out of being an operations-center business, and our main customer and partner focus has therefore always been the operators. Furthermore, there are heavy investments in Africa by the ministries of communication in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon. These ministries realize that every additional 20% invested in the ICT sector will increase a country's GDP by 1%. Huawei has the international experience and it has the demand. We have our strategy and professional employees, so we can match what Ghana needs to create more value for the country.</p><h4>How has Huawei adapted its business model to match Ghana's device market?</h4><p>Even though we now rank number three in the world for smart devices, I have found that the African market is better for entry-level smartphones. In the past, the most popular phones have been feature phones, while smartphones now have 18-20% of the Ghana market. We also found from our market analysis that 50-60% of smartphone demand is for phones valued at less than $200. Nevertheless, we are still finding healthy demand here. We launched the high-end P8 phone in mid-2015, and every month we have sold more than 1,000 devices, which has actually exceeded our expectations. In the near future, we expect phones will be replaced by the smartphone. That is why Huawei also provides entry-level smartphones priced at around $50, like the Y300 series. This is good because it meets the demand from people who want to use social media, music sites, and various applications, which then in turn creates more demand and adds more value for operators.</p><h4>What is the capacity here to employ local engineers and other Ghanaian staff?</h4><p>Huawei has around 700 employees in Ghana, of which only around 100 are Chinese, while the rest are Ghanaian. These include a number of professionals doing high-tech jobs. We have maintenance service contracts for MTN and Vodafone, and more than 98% of the workers are locals in these two big teams and they carry out network maintenance by themselves. Based on this kind of platform, we want to improve the ICT level of Ghanaians. In the future, we will be able to further reduce the number of Chinese workers here.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2016?</h4><p>We still have positive expectations for 2016 because MTN has received a license to develop its 4G network, and this gives Huawei more opportunities. We also have some other projects operating within the government sector. Our smartphone devices segment has grown quickly as well. The company's smartphone market in Ghana has increased from 3% to 10%, and in 2016 we expect it to increase by another 20-25%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the center so far in its lead up to the launch next year?</h4><p><span></span>This project has been in the making for some time. The OCEC is being built in two phases. Phase I, the exhibition center, which includes 22,000sqm of exhibition space and 10 hospitality meeting suites, will be opening early next year. Phase II is the remainder of the convention center, which will feature a 3,200 seat auditorium, a smaller auditorium with 450 seats, 13 meeting rooms, two ballrooms that can be subdivided, a business center, a VIP pavilion, and all of the associated facilities. The convention center will be ready for business in December 2017 and there are already three confirmed events lined up for that month. The main reasons for building the Oman Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre are firstly for economic growth, but also for the development of SMEs and the creation of employment opportunities. Around 90% of the businesses in Oman are SMEs and one of the OCEC's prime objectives is to generate increased business for them.</p><p><span></span>The Centre is already engaging with various SMEs that are relevant for the operation of OCEC across the board. Where possible, the center is trying to source as many requirements as possible for the operation of the venue from local companies. SMEs will be needed for a diverse array of services ranging from kitchen supplies, equipment, print, design, and limousine services. It has already engaged SMEs by bringing them on-site and delivering presentations about the OCEC, its function, and the potential for SME involvement. We also held a large event in 2014 with the Professional Convention Management Association (PCMA), with the aim of introducing 15 international buyers to the Omani marketplace as well as introducing local stakeholders such as government ministries, hoteliers, destination management companies, professional congress organizers, and all others who could have an interest in the OCEC's business to the expectations and requirements of international organizers.</p><h4>How does the OCEC cooperate with Riyada, the Public Authority for SME Development, to facilitate SME involvement?</h4><p><span></span>We could not have achieved success without them. We hosted a specialized event last year for SMEs, where we worked in close collaboration to identify target sectors within their database. We will continue to build upon our partnership to best support the future development of SMEs.</p><h4>What will be the primary benefits of the OCEC for Oman, in both the short and long term?</h4><p><span></span>In the short term, the economic impact is critical, but one of our main reasons is that we are here to promote knowledge exchange. For example, if we host an international healthcare event, we are going to be attracting the best medical minds in the world. We have identified 120-140 international association members who are renowned in their field, all of whom are Omani. Attracting large-scale international conferences is quite a long process, as the lead-time for an international conference can be anything up to 10 years. We may have an attractive destination, but unless we have an active and local member who is going to put himself forward as part of team Oman, we are not going to bring in these events. We will also be looking to host exhibition events, small meetings, local corporate events, weddings, and even incentive programs. There is the flexibility for us to host a range of other cultural and entertainment events, which is an added bonus.</p><h4>Focusing on exposure, what interest has the OCEC attracted internationally? </h4><p><span></span>There are various criteria involved in the decision making process for those we target. We are focusing on international associations no matter where they are based, pinpointing the reasons for them to come to Oman. Our process starts with research. We look at international events that are meaningful to Oman, and that tie in with the nation's economy-based goals, outlined in the national strategy; Vision 2020 and the upcoming Vision 2040.</p><h4>How do you see the center developing Oman's business tourism segment and complementing other countries in the region?</h4><p><span></span>Oman is a relatively new area for international associations to come to. There is always the question as to what the objectives of international associations are, and it is likely that it is to drive membership in the respective region. Some conference subjects certainly have more potential than others in this region. For example, there is a high percentage of diabetes in the region, and consequently that is the type of event we aim to bring to Oman. There is a relatively low number of meetings' destinations in the Gulf region and the opening of our new Centre in Oman will compliment existing facilities in the region and give more choice to clients wishing to introduce events into the GCC. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Omran's most important projects in recent years and which ones are lined up for 2016?</h4><p>Our first tourism project was the Millennium Resort Mussanah which was developed to host the 2nd Asian Beach games in 2010. This was the biggest sporting event ever hosted in the Sultanate and a very proud moment for the nation.  In the following years, the pace of our developments intensified, with the opening of the Jebel Sifah integrated tourism complex, the Crowne Plaza and City Hotel in Duqm, Atana Musandam and Khasab and the award winning Alila Jabal Akhdar resort. In 2014, in order to accommodate our expanding role for the development of tourism infrastructure in Oman, our mandate was broadened and responsibilities were expanded beyond a single asset management company.  </p><p>We are now responsible for mega tourism projects across the country such as the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre (OCEC) and Al Irfan Urban Centre, which is currently in the master-planning stage, and will become the largest mixed use development in the Sultanate to date.  The OCEC project is expected to generate OMR295 million in local spending and contribute OMR200-240 million to the national economy by 2030 according to a study by Booz &amp; Co.  Al Irfan City, which will become a new urban center in the capital, will encompass business and residential zones, retail centres, hotels, tourist attractions, recreation and cultural facilities as well as schools and hospitals, while being conveniently located nearby Muscat International Airport.  </p><h4>What is Omran's relation with foreign investors?</h4><p>We have several high profile joint venture projects underway right now. One of these is Saraya Bandar Jissah, a joint-venture between Omran and Saraya Developments located on the outskirts of Muscat on a secluded beach surrounded by the Hajar Mountains. This is an Integrated Tourism Complex (ITC) scheduled for a grand opening in 2017. It will include five residential zones, a recreation center, and two five-star hotels. The luxury hotels are each positioned on the beach and will offer guests a boutique or resort experience, and will form the major leisure component of Saraya Bandar Jissah.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the tourism sector in the coming five years?</h4><p>The sector is very promising, especially with the opening of the new Muscat International Airport in the next year, which will reduce bottlenecks and enable a capacity of 12 million passengers a year. Developers are also boosting the number of hotel rooms to accommodate the increasing visitors. All of this will mean a stronger tourism sector over the next five years.  </p><h4>The government has been focused on high-end tourism. Do you think the offering will diversify into the middle range?</h4><p>The government's philosophy has been to focus on selective tourism rather than mass tourism. This means quality and repeat tourism and so our facilities and infrastructure should reflect this type of clientele. We aim to entice visitors, whether in Oman for business or leisure, to extend their trip and stay on to enjoy the many offerings available. However, we are seeing a trend of hotel guests who are not budget travelers, but also are not looking to pay $250 or more per night.  We think it is possible to attract and cater to this market without compromising our niche, top-end clientele. This is a challenge but we are working on building facilities that will attract such visitors and at the same time enable them to experience Omani culture. The development of the Atana hotel chain is a step forward in this regard, allowing families and adventurers to enjoy the picturesque sites of Oman at more mid-range prices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the target demographic for tourism in Oman, and what are your targets in terms of tourist numbers?</h4><p>Historically, the GCC has been the main region that Oman has drawn its tourists from. Europe is another major market and, with some of our developing projects, we believe we are going to attract tourists from other areas especially in regards to family travel. We are also in the process of looking towards far eastern markets such as China. In the long term, it is also our aim that the US would become a target market. We are very happy with the demographics coming in. However, with our on-going tourism strategy, we are also focused on the premium tourist, the responsible tourist who respects the culture and environment, and the tourist who can add value to the economy as well. There has been a huge increase in domestic travelling. In 1Q2015, we had an increase of domestic travelling of 24%. </p><h4>How is sustainable tourism being promoted, and are there any specific projects which are being focused on?</h4><p>Most of our projects now are either done by the Ministry directly or by Omran. We are working towards being sustainable because it is the future of tourism. We already have a lot of successful projects that have won some awards, and we have environmental projects to correlate with them. We work with investors to ensure that there are sustainable ways to maintain the environment. We also engage in projects with SMEs that are 100% environmentally friendly, and have started to build up that initiative as a pillar of our culture and a main driver of tourism. The diversification of our economy is important, and if we are going to make tourism a pillar of Oman's economy, we need to ensure that these areas are being addressed with the importance they deserve. </p><h4>In terms of the projects that are being developed by the Ministry, what effect has the oil price reduction had?</h4><p>The country has been working for a long time towards diversifying the economy. The tourism industry is one of the major pillars of the economy, and in the last five years our budget plan has shown a massive increase in funding from the government. Tourism and infrastructure expansion has certainly been a major part of their plan, and the infrastructure expansion was intended to invest on building up the industry of tourism. This country takes planning ahead seriously, which is why we ensure that investments are well planned and supported. The oil prices may have even helped with investments in the tourism sector. The sector is taking more credit in terms of development, and we now have over nine offices in the various regions of the country. Offices have been opened abroad, and the whole vision of the government is reflected in the tourism sector. The expansion of the airports has shown positive growth for the tourism industry as well. The oil prices dropping certainly poses challenges, but we now have an opportunity to work on our five-year plan. We also have a long-term tourism vision for 2040, which we are executing with the government.</p><h4>Looking ahead in terms of your targets, what are key indicators of success for the Ministry of Tourism?</h4><p>The target is to generate half a million jobs to accommodate our projected 5 million international  tourists by 2040. Most importantly, our strength is to connect and coordinate in the way that the Ministry of Tourism works in Oman. The vision of the government is to ensure that the main sectors have a better focus and add value to the country. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Adding Value]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[adding-value]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been the impact of NTI's recent merger with Babcock International Group?</h4><p>The merger is an immense added value to NTI's presence in Oman as a training provider because Babcock is one of the largest, most well-known and accepted providers in the UK and has a presence across the world. The merger is particularly of value in gaining more GCC countries, who are always looking for Western or international partners for education and training. As such, the acquisition by Babcock has been not only positive for NTI as a training provider, giving us the backing, know-how, technology, and experience of an international player, but from the local market perspective as well.</p><h4>What is your approach to Omanization?</h4><p>Omanization is a positive development and has been successful in this country in comparison to other GCC countries that are trying to implement the same initiative. Omanis are willing to work, particularly women. We have the population, and there is a huge need. It is now about finding the right approach.</p><h4>What collaboration does NTI have between the private and public sectors?</h4><p>Though we are mainly working within the private sector, the government also uses our services to develop their workforce. We offer a range of soft services such as IT training and business management skill-building that the government utilizes. Typically, however, the policies and directions given by the government guide us, and we work predominantly with the private sector to help them localize their workforce.</p><h4>What gaps currently exist in the Omani system?</h4><p>Oman is in an interesting situation. The private sector is looking for a local workforce. There is a need to employ workers, a population seeking employment, and funding to ensure that training is provided. However, we have a challenge. We cannot find enough takers for jobs in the private sector because people are looking for government jobs. The other issue is that workers are demanding high salaries, which is not cost affective for the average private sector company. Currently NTI offers entry-level jobs that will pay over $1,000 a month. We receive enough funding to offer a stipend of $750 a month, but no takers. Since January 2015, we have only filled 150 out of over 500 positions available.</p><h4>What are NTI's objectives in terms of diversifying the economy?</h4><p>Generally, it is our primary activity to work with employers and provide them with solutions. In order to work with employers to achieve their objectives, we have invested in our facilities and programs. Our capacity has expanded, and in the next two months NTI will move to a new, fit-for-purpose campus. Part of the reason NTI has invested so much time and money into a new campus, is to change negative perceptions about the Omani training industry and give confidence to the market.</p><h4>What are the major challenges for the training industry?</h4><p>Part of the reason NTI has invested so much time and money into a new campus is to give confidence to the market. We are working to change negative perceptions about the Omani training industry. In Oman, the cultural mindset needs to change as well. The major challenge in our industry is the perception of the population and unrealistic expectations for high salaries. Right now, people want to jump to the top right away without experience, so the idea of building expertise needs to be learned. </p><h4>What are NTI's expectations for the next five years?</h4><p>There is definitely organic growth occurring in Oman. We are looking at a regional move to see how we can export our capability within the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you highlight some of the major developments of the university in terms of new programs and courses?</h4><p>The University of Nizwa has been working hard on implementing a new strategy of expansion from 2015 to 2020. There are several new programs that have been added for both the undergraduate and Master's degrees. We have finalized the license for visual arts and fine arts. We have also added several Master's programs one of which is for teachers of Arabic as a second language. We also have a master's degree for technical staff in applied chemistry. We have several programs related to pharmacy and nursing in the pipeline. We introduced several programs for economics and finance, and we are including Islamic finance and related issues. We also have sustainability management, and in terms of research, we managed to acquire the national chair for materials science and metallurgy. We are doing this in collaboration with the University of Cambridge. Oman has been blessed with great mineral resources so the aim is to add value there. </p><h4>What have been the results thus far for Nizwa graduates entering the national workforce?</h4><p>In order to be ahead of the game, we are reviewing all of our academic programs. A major part of this is revising curriculum development and delivery. The government has conducted surveys, and we have conducted surveys as well to see what our graduates are doing. We have seen an enhanced positioning of our graduates, and many are employed sooner after graduating. The government has also hired many of our graduates in the past few years, and over 80% are employed which is a high rate. Many of our masters students graduate straight into a job, and it is an added value and life improvement tool for them to shift to a new position shortly thereafter. We have graduated overall 6,800 students, which is now around the same number of students we have on campus. Our graduates in engineering especially are well received by international companies, and our graduates in pharmacy and nursing are well received by hospitals. </p><h4>Do you engage in talks with the private sector here in Oman to see what their human capital needs are?</h4><p>Higher education is increasingly engaging with the private sector. However, there are some issues right now. The private sector has a problem because most of it is made up of small companies who cannot afford to employ graduates. The multinational companies also have limited human capital costs. We are now producing many female graduates, and our student population is 85% female. We have created advisory councils for each college of the university that composed of potential employers of both public and private companies. We are also working hard on entrepreneurial studies, creating a center for entrepreneurship in order to help students start their own businesses.  The government is requiring all students to take a course in entrepreneurship before they graduate. We are trying to be part of the solutions, and we want to enhance opportunities for our students. </p>]]></richbody0content>

What is the outlook for this, and how can it benefit both the students and the long-term development of Oman?</h4><p>Every year, the Ministry of Higher Education offers a number of scholarships to students passing General Education Diploma (GED). These scholarships are both internal and external scholarships with a wide range of programs that supply the manpower sector in Oman with qualified graduates in the selected areas, which will go along the economic growth and development. The number of external scholarships has increased dramatically in the past few years to cope with new economic projects that the country has started to build or plans to accomplish in different governorates, such as the railway project, the logistics city, and the industrial city in Al-Duqm. The opportunities for Omani students to study abroad have increased from 143 to more than 1643 annually since 2011-12. By providing these scholarships, the Ministry is contributing to the strategic plan of human resources development and adding a qualified workforce in specialized areas for the upcoming projects and long-term development of Oman. These scholarships also help students to gain the latest knowledge in their fields of specialties and open their minds to different cultures, education systems, and languages.</p><h4>How would you assess the balance between private- and public-sector education?</h4><p>As a result of the increasing number of school graduates who then seek access to higher education, the government has developed its policies and regulations to encourage the private sector to contribute to increasing this accessibility and participate in developing Oman by providing higher education programs that achieve the goals of the country drawn out by His Majesty's government in the path of sustainable development. At this stage, I think the balance between the two providers of higher education in Oman is there, in terms of government funding, student intake, types of programs, and the process of quality management.</p><h4>Many sectors of Oman's economy are demonstrating increased potential for investment. What opportunities can the education sector provide for both local and international investors?</h4><p>Oman encourages a great business-friendly environment, including respect of free markets, contract sanctity, property rights, low taxes, a convenient and growing transportation network, as well as a largely bilingual Omani work force. The Ministry of Higher Education encourages higher education institutions (HEIs) to build strong and fruitful cooperation with well-ranked international institutions in research and education through affiliation agreements. Such cooperation can also support local institutions to create a strong system for quality assurance. Moreover, all HEIs in Oman are to undergo an accreditation process in the near future to determine the level of education quality in these institutions. This has stimulated HEIs to develop relationships with highly experienced universities to build their capacity. Other forms of opportunities also exist for investors to promote the higher education sector, such as transferring technology and developing management expertise through joint venture initiatives that can benefit all parties on a win-win basis.</p><h4>Oman has begun to initiate new locations such as Innovation Park Muscat and the Oman Convention Center. How can the Ministry contribute to, and benefit from, initiatives such as this?</h4><p>As part of its vision for transitioning to a knowledge-based economy, Oman has invested greatly in major infrastructure facilities that are essential to achieving this target. Innovation Park Muscat (IPM) is designed to create an innovative environment for researchers, scientists, start-ups, SMEs, and multinationals. IPM will stimulate and manage the flow of knowledge amongst HEIs, R&amp;D institutions, and the business community. This process can benefit HEIs a great deal. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the major areas of expertise for the Hospital?</h4><p>The Royal Hospital is a tertiary-level, acute-care referral hospital, which focuses on the specialties and sub-specialties of pediatrics, medical, surgical, obstetrics and gynecology, oncology, diabetic, genetic, and cardiac services in Oman. Because of the lack of a secondary-care hospital in Muscat, the Royal Hospital caters to both specialist and super-specialty care. Being the apex referral center in Oman for many diseases, it has the responsibility to provide speedy consultation and interventional services to patients referred from regional hospitals, other capital area hospitals, and health centers in the Muscat governorate.</p><h4>A critical part of healthcare development in Oman is nurturing young Omanis to become the next generation of doctors. How would you assess the quality and number of doctors coming through at the moment?</h4><p>Omani doctors are well trained and are of a standard comparable to similarly qualified doctors in the Western world. After their basic medical degree, the best of the graduates are selected by the Oman Medical Specialty Board for the post-graduate residency program here. Besides fulfilling their academic requirements, clinical rotations and passing the qualifying examination, most of the residents pass MRC /MRCS, Arab Board, or other international examinations. They are then sponsored abroad by the government for a two-year fellowship so that it can sub-specialize in a specific field and also be exposed to state-of-art technology and practices in the UK, Canada, the US, Australia, and Germany. Most of these doctorate-level doctors have returned to set up very specialized services such as hematology, oncology, radiotherapy, interventional radiology, interventional cardiology, cardiac electrophysiology, surgical oncology, gynecological oncology, fetal medicine, stem cell transplant, and so on</p><h4>Royal Hospital is the signature hospital in the country. How would you assess the current standards of medical care throughout the rest of the country?</h4><p>Under the leadership of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said, Oman is fortunate to have developed an excellent healthcare infrastructure. The WHO has repeatedly praised Oman's Ministry of Health for its wide network of primary, secondary, and tertiary level healthcare institutions, which work very cohesively and effectively. Communicable diseases are largely controlled, and the Ministry has active programs for non-communicable diseases (diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, cancer, genetic diseases). The infant mortality rate is down from 118 per 1,000 live births in 1974 to 9.8 currently, and the life expectancy at birth has risen from around 54 years in the 1970s to 76.6 years presently. Oman has modern hospitals, polyclinics, and health centers that deliver care of a very high standard free of charge. Except for few very specialized procedures, Oman is self-reliant in terms of medical care. And for these exceptional procedures, the Ministry of Health's Treatment Abroad Office screens and refers patients abroad at government cost. Some patients do go abroad on their own, particularly for a second-opinion, but we find that even they invariably return to be followed up at the government hospitals.</p><h4>According to some sources, Oman imports 93% of its medical supplies. To what extent could increased local production boost medical establishments such as Royal Hospital, as well as the healthcare sector in general?</h4><p>The firms manufacturing medical supplies locally include: Salalah Medical Supplies, which produces gloves, cotton, gauze, medical tapes; National Pharmaceutical Industries (NPI) and Oman Pharmaceutical Products (OPP), which manufacture around 73 items, mostly in tablet, capsule, topical cream/ointment, and syrup form; and Medical Lab Factory, which produces readymade laboratory media. These firms are doing well and are progressively increasing the capacity and range of their products. There is, however, a great potential for indigenous manufacturers of many simple items like syringes, catheters, cannulas, intravenous and dialysis fluids, incontinence pads, disposable gowns, surgical masks, and dressing kits. The Ministry of Health is very supportive of the industry. The pharmaceuticals produced locally are of good quality, and are well accepted by the prescribers and the patients. Being generic drugs, the cost is also significantly less than imported brands. Thus many more patients can be served with the same budget. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As Oman attempts to diversify the economy, what investment opportunities are there in the healthcare sector?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health recognizes the importance of proper health planning. Accordingly, it developed its long-term Health Vision 2050 for developing and sustaining the health system. Health Vision 2050 extensively analyzed the health status of the population and identified paths for development as well as opportunities for international players. The analysis, for example, showed that about 91.1% of requirements from pharmaceuticals and surgical consumables, and all laboratory items, are met through imports; in other words, only 7.6% of pharmaceuticals and consumables are purchased from local manufacturers, and among registered products, local manufacturers register only 3.3%. There is a need to encourage and support the local manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and consumables and to invite major international pharmaceutical manufacturers and investors to set up production in Oman and/or to tie up with local Omani manufacturers for the production of medicines and vaccines if self-reliance is to be achieved.</p><h4>How does the Ministry of Health collaborate with the education authorities to ensure that Omanis are receiving the best opportunities to work in healthcare?</h4><p>Medical education commenced in Oman in 1986 with the establishment of the College of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Muscat. Prior to that, Omani students had to travel abroad in order to pursue medical degrees. The General Medical Council of the UK accredits the MD degree from Sultan Qaboos University. A few private medical colleges are now functioning in Oman, for example Oman Medical College and Oman Dental College. Sultan Qaboos University, health institutes of the Ministry of Health, and private educational institutes including Oman Medical College and Nizwa University provide training to other health professions. The Ministry of Higher Education supports a number of national physicians and other allied health workers to travel abroad for undergraduate and postgraduate education and training. The Ministry of Health also considers sending physicians abroad for postgraduate training. Physicians will thus be exposed to different experiences and to the latest technologies as well as advances in diseases management techniques. In addition to supporting travel abroad programs for postgraduate training, the Oman Medical Specialty Board (OMSB), which was established in 1994 by the Ministry of Health and Sultan Qaboos University, is currently the highest supervisory body of all postgraduate medical training programs in Oman. </p><h4>What role does the Ministry play in regulating the pharmaceutical sector, and how can this area contribute to the development of healthcare throughout the country?</h4><p>The Ministry of Health, the main health care provider, spends about 7.3% of its recurrent expenditure on medicine. The Oman National Drug Policy was issued and approved in July 2000. The policy laid out its general objective in its own words as: “The objective of the National Drug Policy is to develop, within the resources of the country, the potential that drugs have to control common diseases and alleviate suffering. The policy aims to ensure and express Government commitment to this objective and to serve as a guide for action by all involved parties in the government, academia, professional organizations, non-governmental organizations, industries, patients, and consumers." In this regard, the health system has taken all the necessary steps to ensure that all legislations and regulations related to medicine and medical products are regularly updated to ensure accessibility to the proper, safe, effective, cost-effective medicines that meet the approved standards and specifications and their distribution to the needy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the national strategy for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries? What is the ideal outcome for your strategy to add value to sectors with proposed investments for 2016 to 2020?</h4><p>We have a strategy for increasing the catch from the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Sea of Oman over the next six years. We are also boosting production of aquaculture and fish farming, and we expect increases in aquaculture production around 40%. We are aiming towards something close to 500,000 tons by 2020 from both Oman Seas, as well as the high seas. To achieve this we are planning on significant infrastructure investment for fishing ports and markets, as well as fishing free development, human resource development, aquaculture development, and other related projects that will contribute to the growth of the sector. </p><h4>The Undersecretary of the Ministry of Oil and Gas predicted in the Muscat Daily that some projects will have to be shelved if oil prices continue to drop, and an estimated 60% fall in production. On your end, do you expect any layoffs or cutbacks in the Ministry?</h4><p>Until now, no decisions have been made. The government will likely continue projects as planned, especially those that will have a high impact on employment and growth. So far this year the ministry has not had to suspend any projects, so we will be moving forward. </p><h4>What are your GDP target amounts?</h4><p>The GDP for fisheries is 2%, and this is what we would like to achieve. This is what we call the gate price or the face sale revenues, though when the whole value chain is considered, currently we are closer to 3%. </p><h4>What is the status of existing domestic and international partnerships and investments?</h4><p>In aquaculture we have many investors from Europe, the US, South Africa, and Asia coming to Oman for fish farming. There were a number of joint projects and ventures established locally last year, and we anticipate more this year. At the moment investments are good, but we will see whether this will continue at the same pace or if we will see things slow down in regard to oil prices.</p><h4>How is Omanization impacting the sector, and how is the Ministry attracting a skilled workforce?<br></h4><p>Currently, there are around 45,000 fishermen registered with the Ministry, and there are another 8,000 workers employed in the fish market, in trading and manufacturing and other related services. We are introducing a modern fleet that will be suitable for the Gulf, with modern technology and crafts to increase convenience. It is important for the Ministry to make the fishing profession appealing to our youth, particularly those not suited for higher education. We are trying to advertise the fact that with the price of fish, the return from fishing is higher than in other sectors. We have been working with the World Bank on an 18-month contract to convert Omani fishing into a world-class fishing industry, and we are aiming to increase fishermen's incomes over the next 15 years.</p><h4>How is the agriculture and fisheries sector connecting to other sectors? </h4><p>Our closest sectors are tourism and logistics. Oman is situated in a strategic central area, and we are able to provide services to all the containers passing through Sohar, Duqm, or Salalah. The fishing industry can benefit because the fish trade needs multiple routes to Asia or Europe. We see high traffic between Oman ports and international ports, so it will be easy within the next three to four years to send frozen products by sea, or fresh by air, road, or railway, to service the Middle East and Gulf region, if not beyond. </p><h4>What are your expectations for this year, and what will be the Ministry's priorities for the next five years?</h4><p>The Ministry wants to see an increase in the size of the catches and around a 10% increase in production. We expect the opening of new ports along the Arabian Sea, such as Mahout and Sharia, Sohar and Khalid. In the next five years we will kick-start the project in Duqm, both the fishing port and industrial zone, and see it fully operational by 2020. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the development of the agricultural sector over the last year and what are the major projects you have been running during this period?</h4><p>We have been continuing with our five-year development plans. As 2015 is the final year of this strategy, we have been completing some of the ongoing projects. Besides that there is an important development. We have established a company called the Oman Food Holding Investment Company, which is the investment arm of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. This company has already embarked on a number of strategic projects aimed at bridging the gap between Oman's production and the country's requirements, including in the areas of poultry, table eggs, dairy farming, and red meat production. We also have a date palm project nearing completion in terms of the consulting work. The company has made good progress in mobilizing these projects during 2015 and is close to the implementation stage. This is the main development that has occurred over the past two years</p><h4>Which products are demonstrating potential in Oman's agricultural sector?</h4><p>All the products I have highlighted demonstrate potential either because they are important for food security or there is potential to add value to the production. Take for example our date palms. At the moment there is minimal processing of this crop and I believe we can do much more given that we have approximately 8 million palms in Oman. Again, we are emphasizing bridging the gap between food production and requirements, as well as adding value to what we produce. The room for improvement is there. We produce around 20 red meat products and 50 other items including the table eggs and dairy products. We hope we can increase production; however, we also have to meet demand from our fast population growth, which is rapidly driving up domestic consumption.</p><h4>What is your strategy to balance agriculture and fisheries exports?</h4><p>Other than fisheries, we export a number of crops particularly to neighboring countries, although some of these products go as far as Japan and Europe. This is an indication of the quality of the food we produce and the demand for it in different countries. Now it is time to focus more on the products that add value for Oman. Hence, for the next five-year plan we would like to concentrate on important products that have a comparative and competitive advantage. In terms of fisheries, we currently export 55-60% of what Oman catches or produces. Again, it mostly goes overseas in raw form without processing, and we can add considerable value to what we do by processing. </p><h4>What new opportunities do you foresee for foreign investors?</h4><p>The fact that we are attracting outside investment shows confidence that the investment environment here is favorable. It is being reflected in FDI in the area of the food industry. Oman has political stability plus it is a liberal society in terms of conducting business, including the tax holiday and repatriation schemes. There are not really many restrictions on investment in Oman. We are emphasizing more and more the quality aspect and we want to retain a niche for Oman at the higher levels rather than competing across the board. It is more difficult to do this; however, we believe we can and it will give us a good reputation with the partners we deal with. For example, some of our agricultural companies made deals with international companies to market their products before they were even at the operation stage, which means we are already reaching that level. The Japanese market, where some of our agricultural products go, is the most sophisticated. It is a very quality-aware market and we have to meet that standard. Of course, we also have to increase production to export more to Japan. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you currently assess competition considering that Doka is a fairly unique company in the region?</h4><p>In Oman, you find, more or less, the same density of competition as you have in Dubai. Only that nearly all of them did and do not invest in Oman but operate from outside. Oman is price-sensitive, meaning there are many low-range, cheap competitors. With every new client we need to demonstrate that our products are sustainable, that they are of superior quality and durability, that they are expensive on an “item-by-item“ consideration, but of high economy once seen on a “overall-solution“ scale because of their low manpower requirement, long life-span, and ease of utilization It is a daily challenge to all of us. But more and more contractors of all sizes recognize the value of our products and services and see at least our formwork as an investment and not as a commodity.</p><h4>Why does Doka not manufacture formwork products in Oman?</h4><p>We would like there to be more facilities in Oman, meaning more external suppliers that we could use. It does not pay to have the core items produced in many different places. To have a high range of quality, you need the best supply of whatever is needed. You need to have consistent production and such an investment requires huge investments; therefore, you cannot do this in too many different places around the world. Our customer-oriented, tailor-made formwork solutions here and there require special formwork items. Also made-to-fit. With increasing business-volume, our demand for such products is also increasing. So far Oman is not offering sufficient and competitive capacity for our demand. But it is totally different in the UAE. There is a substantial number of these midsize enterprises that did invest and maintain a high quality standard of manufacture. A thoroughly selected and permanently inspected number of these enterprises are able to manufacture under our supervision as per our drawings and standards, tailor-made.</p><h4>How would you assess the ease of doing business in this sector? </h4><p>The Sultanate of Oman is developing rapidly and becomes more and more modern every day—also in the construction sector. This offers acceptable potential for next to all products and services. On the other hand, this fast growth goes along with a number of challenges. Sometimes I would wish that the development of banking facilities towards payment securities, the standard of the legal system and the standard of project planning and preparation, would develop similarly swifly and efficiently. However, overall, he who is prepared to come to stay, is hard-working and has patience and understanding will maybe not make a fortune but always find sufficient reward for his efforts. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the first ITC project to launch in seven years, why is this project so important for the Oman market?</h4><p><span></span>The development as a whole will be a key economic driver, creating job opportunities and encouraging further investment into the country. The traditional industries in Oman continue to play a vital role in the country's economy, and developers have been keen to boost the non-oil sectors of real estate and tourism. The Oman of today is a country with a fine-tuned vision for its tourism industry and is forging ahead with plans to build a premium destination, which targets discerning travelers and investors. The project will provide direct employment to roughly 800 people and a special emphasis has been placed on job training and creating employment opportunities to members of the local community.</p><h4>Recent pictures of the development are bringing to reality the vision of the Saraya Bandar Jissah project. What are your thoughts on the pace of the project's development?</h4><p><span></span>The development of the project is progressing on schedule. Our last quarterly construction update showed that a number of significant developments have taken place. The advanced earthworks and excavation on the site were completed in April 2015. A majority of the internal roadways have also been completed and the leveling of ground around the lagoon, supportive walls, dams and channels has been completed. 80% of the primary infrastructure has also been completed, including the high and low voltage electricity network, water network, irrigation system, sanitary drainage, and telecommunication network, including high-speed internet. All residential zones are progressing as per the schedule.</p><h4>With five residential zones and a range of other amenities, the scale of the project is substantial. How are sales for the residences at the moment, and what are the main attractions for both local and international buyers?</h4><p><span></span>The response to our properties in terms of sales has been exceptional and the demand continues to track ahead of our sales forecasts. We have seen a similar trend for every subsequent sales batch thereafter. The main attraction is its accessible location, right in the heart of the touristic hub of Muscat. The project offers an unmatched balance of convenience, accessibility and exclusivity; effortlessly balancing the best aspects of an ITC while maintaining the natural beauty of the site.</p><h4>Saraya Bandar Jissah has a range of partners and collaborations for construction, contracting, and financing. What opportunities will the project provide to create jobs and what role can SMEs play within this project?</h4><p><span></span>Great effort has been made in marrying together a sleek and individual modern design with the traditional surroundings of Bandar Jissah, the traditional Omani architectural methods and design elements. The hotels alone will generate about 650-700 jobs. Many more jobs will be created for the operation and management of facilities. Cumulatively, we are looking at about 800 direct job opportunities. Moreover, in the tourism sector, any direct job opportunity will indirectly generate three or more additional jobs at the macroeconomic level. Prior to the hotels being fully operational, we will employ Omanis and train them in accordance with international standards and best practices to ensure they are well-prepared to work in the hotels.</p><h4><span></span>Looking in particular at the partnership with Jumeirah, what benefits can this brand bring to the project, and how can projects such as Saraya Bandar Jissah contribute to the developing identity of Oman as a destination for real estate and tourism?</h4><p>Jumeirah Group is a Dubai-based international luxury hotel chain known for their high-end, luxurious, and distinctive properties. Their entrance into the market will set new levels of excellence within Oman's hospitality sector, and bring a wealth of global experience from their operations in the luxury hotel and travel sector.</p><p>The Sultanate's tourism industry is starting to grow considerably, and over the next 10 years the projected employment growth within Oman's travel and tourism sector is set to increase 3.8% annually according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.  Within the next 10 years, the sector is estimated to contribute 7.3%, or OMR 3,222.3 million to the GDP. These figures are clear evidence of the sector's increasingly important role. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back over the past year, what have been the most important projects and initiatives that Al Mouj Muscat has been involved in?</h4><p>The last nine months have been particularly busy and extremely successful for Al Mouj Muscat. There have been a number of significant milestones including record sales, sell-out releases such as The Gardens, and the addition of new leisure and lifestyle experiences to the community Master Plan, such as the Health Precinct at the Walk. Of course, a significant development during the last year has been the rebranding process we have recently completed, transitioning from The Wave, Muscat to Al Mouj Muscat. The new brand recognises the project's maturity and is a celebration of the depth of our Arabian heritage and character. It also marks our evolution as a benchmark for property development in the country and as a model for public-private cross-border collaboration, as demonstrated by the Omani Government, Tanmia, and Majid Al Futtaim Properties, a partnership that provides the solid foundation underpinning our community's continued growth.  In Arabic, mouj means not only a wave, but also mobility and force, a concept that more appropriately represents how Al Mouj Muscat provides a platform of opportunities and momentum for growth for other businesses.</p><h4>What is the potential for Al Mouj to expand its partnerships and corporate client base?</h4><p>Institutional investors are becoming more discerning in the type of assets and locations they are prepared to invest in and there has been a lot of interest for emerging opportunities. Al Mouj Muscat is one of the region's leading communities, making it an attractive destination to consider investing in. Al Mouj provides the opportunity to invest in multiple asset classes, including residential, tourism, retail, and commercial with yields that are attractive compared to alternative investment options. </p><h4>What is your current background of occupants? What are your targets in demographics?</h4><p>42% of our buyers are Omani, a further 25% are expats living in Oman, and the balance is expats outside of Oman. We have a balanced demographic of buyers at Al Mouj and it is exactly in line with the initial plan. As for buyers or renters, when the development first kicked off it was 80% investors and only 20% owners/occupiers. Now, the figure for owners/occupiers is close to 40% and above, which is a fantastic achievement for the project. It underpins the future value, whereby the local population of Omanis and also expats believe and see the value in an integrated community such as Al Mouj.</p><h4>Al Mouj is the first ITC to cooperate closely with Haya Water to promote clean waste management. Can you discuss the details of this partnership?</h4><p>All our operations from the community through to the Almouj Golf and Almouj Marina have developed and implemented environmental management plans for their respective operations. This has been further reinforced by Almouj Golf and Almouj Marina being the first in the region to be accredited by their respective industries for their environmental practices. </p><h4>To what extent is the tourism sector developing in the right manner and at the appropriate pace?</h4><p>Oman's natural touristic assets have increased the demand from the outside world to visit and have a traditional, authentic Arabic experience. The challenge for the industry is to develop the necessary infrastructure and services to support the necessary levels of tourism. While that is happening across all different levels, from five- to three-star hotels, the challenge is implementing it quickly. With the opening of the new airport in 2016, a new phase will begin for Muscat and Oman in general. A balance is required, as hotels have to match the experiences and consumer demand. Oman is trying to attract the top end of the tourism sector and, to that end, there is more development of four- and five-star hotels taking place. Diversification is important, but the government's viion is to attract the top end and to provide quality experiences within the country's natural assets. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent developments at the Port of Duqm?</h4><p>The Port of Duqm is experiencing faster and faster growth. Though the project is still under construction, we are not waiting until full completion before activities get started. We have begun the port operation, though it took some time to convince various stakeholders of the use and availability of the port. Now, in 2014 and 2015, we are seeing big changes as we consolidate most of the oil and gas project cargo via the port. This offers two major advantages. The first is that we are within 300km of the main oil fields, which is quite important. Secondly, we are a national port, and most of the large oil and gas project cargo depends on our neighboring port, Jebel Ali, where companies need to risk international pressure. It is always good for companies to be able to rely on their own country's assets for the development of industry. Aside from that, we are seeing more and more interest from international logistics companies to use Duqm as a staging hub for their goods. The port is gearing up for the crucial launch of the next phase of construction, which will take roughly two years to complete. We will have to ensure our cargo transit while we finish construction, as well as consolidate further. </p><h4>How is the partnership continuing to evolve between the Belgian and Omani government?</h4><p>The partnership is progressing quite well. We are in a unique situation whereby Oman is part of a 50-50 joint venture. We have the same decision-making powers and power of intervention that the other stakeholders have because we are an equal partner. </p><h4>What is the impact of key free trade agreements on Duqm?</h4><p>At this point we are more in the planning stage; once Duqm actually begins full operations, then we will be able to take full advantage of the situation. Today, we are not seeing a huge advantage to having the free trade agreements. However, the mandate of the Port of Duqm is to prepare the country for the post-oil era, and these kinds of agreements, on top of the port's strategic position, will add to the list of reasons to choose the port and its industrial land. </p><h4>How is the drop in oil prices affecting activities at the port, and how are you adapting to a sustained low price point?</h4><p>We are not feeling the drop too significantly in day-to-day construction activities. Due to the fact that this is a key project for the country, the government cannot take the risk of slowing it down. Of course, we are erring on the side of caution. The entire value and supply chain in Oman has been asked to reduce costs and the burden on the national budget, so we are all doing our bit to cut down costs to help support the development of the country.</p><h4>What are the largest challenges for the Port of Duqm?</h4><p>The biggest challenge we face, with such a large project receiving constant press, is the management of expectations. Unrealistic expectations can often be generated, and we are not spending millions, but billions of dollars on this project. Something of this magnitude does not grow overnight. The difficult part can be closing the gap between expectations and reality, to help people understand that these types of megaprojects take time and do grow out of the ground. Aside from that, we are working on the continuation of the building of the port itself and focusing on fact-finding solutions to speed up the process. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you highlight the major accomplishments for SEZAD in 2015?</h4><p>Duqm is the latest economic zone in the region, which covers 1,745sqkm. The difference between our zone and others in the region is that ours is fully integrated. We have large zones and sub zones within the same area that include warehouses, ports, dry docks, airports, and a fishing zone. We are waiting now for the gas pipeline to come, and our focus is on the non-gas energy industries. The gas will come before 2019. We are also active in the tourism zone, because there is no need for gas energy in that. The climate is good, which has made tourism attractive in Duqm. We have beautiful and clean beaches that are still untouched. Because we are between Muscat and Salalah, people often pass between the two places, stay in Duqm, and enjoy a few nights. It has become a station and rest area to break up a long journey. The airport has a temporary terminal currently, which is sufficient for now; however, a large terminal will begin construction and finish within two years. The runway is one of the largest among local airports, and it can even accommodate an Airbus A380. The port is one of the largest in terms of its size in the Middle East and North Africa, and most of it is finished with only a few phases left. The port is currently working commercially, and we are receiving shipments for the oil fields. We have the dry dock, which maintains around 300 ships. We are expecting a lot of activity for the port and dry dock in the near future because of the number of shipping companies we have contacts with. The infrastructure, including roads and lighting, is almost complete. We have some roads to residences that still need to be completed. We recently tried to include the private sector because of the good response we have received from them. There is a company listed on the Muscat Securities Market, which is building a huge complex. It will be able to accommodate 16,000 people, including the latest facilities and entertainment. We also signed a contract with an Australian real estate company that will develop a resort, close to which will be a commercial center. It will build a complex that will cost about $500 million; however, it will be completed in phases.</p><h4>Looking at Oman's transportation and logistics sector as a whole, how would you say Duqm has complemented Sohar and Salalah to increase connectivity?</h4><p>All of them are complementing each other, yet Duqm is most efficient due to its multi-modal connectivity system comprising a sea, air, and road network and upcoming inner rail network, thus making Duqm SEZ the logistics hub for the Middle East region, Indian subcontinents, Asia, and Africa. It is worth mentioning that the upcoming road link from Oman to Saudi Arabia would generate potential to enhance business between the two countries leveraging both insurance and time value.</p><h4>What are your major targets and plans for the coming year in order to continue to implement these major projects?</h4><p>Duqm has a large area to cover, and we are working on developing in phases. We are undertaking large projects to serve as anchors, such as the port. We are expecting the refinery and petrochemicals to come in as anchors, too. Our airport will play a major role with cargo because it is both a local and regional airport. We need to finish the uncompleted aspects of the port so that it is able to function at full capacity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the new projects that AMLS has been focusing on over the past year and what additional business will this bring for the company?</h4><p>The plan by the government is to focus more on the logistics industry. The international relationship we have with many countries puts us in a position to be a vital player for the logistics supply chain. Last year we focused on this initiative, and one of our major projects was to complete the link between Salalah's port and airport. Part of this facility is being serviced by CFS, which is a container station and the only one in Oman. Mainly we are serving airports, but we are expanding into other areas as well. This is in addition to our normal third-party logistics.</p><h4>How would you assess the expansion of your services in Oman over the past year?</h4><p>This year we are doing very well, and we have already expanded well with the port in Sohar. We are serving crucial areas. With manufacturing coming, we are focusing on freight and export costs especially with the raw materials that they get in with the imports. We can manage the warehouses for better manufacturing efficiency. This is an area that we are focusing more on in Sohar. Our operations are doing well in Salalah, where our focus is still on local businesses with the free zone and the port. We have tried to work on being a link between the port and the airport in the section. Duqm and Salalah are our main focuses, and we will be focusing on oil and gas services primarily in Duqm.</p><h4>One of the most important aspects to support logistics in Oman is developing links with all of the major transport segments. What is AMLS' expertise in ensuring connectivity?</h4><p>Our expertise has ensured that we are already doing that now, and our logistics provides a full supply chain. We provide freight transportation, warehousing, and so on. We have our own assets in house so we are not only a service provider. We have done it first through connecting the Sohar airport to Muscat, and we reduced traffic through connecting Muscat to the airport cargo. This year we are working on doing the same thing with some border clients who want to export through Salalah airport. We are putting this link into operation, and it is going well so far. We are working with Saudi Arabia and mostly with the UAE. We are trying to develop this area, through the Dubai and the Sharjah airports. We can bring the goods here and re export through our airport. </p><h4>Can you highlight some of the ways in which AMLS will contribute to the government's new logistics strategy?</h4><p>The main areas in the new logistics strategies that can be highlighted are human resources, technology, IT, marketing, and trade facilitation. Within all of these we are looking at areas of focus to tell the government the right way to go. Trade facilitation needs to be efficient in order to apply and get permission or else no one will come. The same goes for IT because the business sector has to have connectivity or else no one will come to you. Human resources take time because it is a new sector. Marketing is also relatively new but we have to have the resources and technology in place to do that. Marketing gives us value back, and we are looking at facilities that are completely technology based and transparent so that clients can track their goods. Every process can be tracked from a smartphone, and this IT support is important for these services. The government must give its approval for certain vessels, and the authorities are working on that as part of their strategy in order to increase efficiency. All international investors want these things to ensure ease of business and connectivity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has NFC performed in terms of strengthening passenger numbers and developing its services during 2015?</h4><p>This year has been a buzz of activity at NFC; we take immense pride to report, in its sixth year of successful operation, that we have achieved 90.79% service reliability. By the end of July 2015, the company achieved 97.14% punctuality in departure times as a demonstrated benchmark of operational excellence in performance. MV Shannah was adjudged “the best passenger" ferry and “best manufacturing model" in 2014 at a global level event by the Shipbuilding Magazine. Scheduled services to Dibba were launched in August 2014, serving as an important link between the Batinah and Musandam regions. During the first half of this year, NFC transported 81,356 passengers compared to 20,786 during the same period in 2014. Statistics also pointed out that 21,547 vehicles have been transported during the first half of 2015 compared to 3,106 vehicles during the same period in 2014. The company also shipped 2,589 tons of goods compared to 861 tons during the corresponding period last year. During the first half of 2015, NFC transported 66,712 passengers,  or 82% of the total number of passengers, and 18,503 vehicles, or 85% of the total number of vehicles transported by NFC, through Shannah and Masirah. NFC successfully obtained the coveted ISO 9001-2008, ISO 10002-2004 certification in its commitment toward customer service and customer satisfaction standards benchmarking. On the human resources development front, we are pleased that we successfully trained and prepared our first batch of Omani Second Officers to appear for the COC examination by the Flag State and qualified the first batch of Omani Chief Officers in the history of NFC. In a major development in August 2015, NFC completed the construction of the advanced link-span project at Dibba port, which allows the company to provide vehicular transport through that port for the first time.</p><h4>How successful was the practice ferry between Khasab and Qeshm, and what does this mean for the expansion of NFC services in the long term?</h4><p>The outcome of the sea trial has been very positive in terms of our ability to operate this potential route in the near future. In view of the positive outcome of the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 countries following the agreement reached in July 2015, we expect direct maritime trade between Oman and Iran to be a reality very soon. This would mean direct expansion in scheduled services and routes for NFC both in the near- and the long-term perspective. Subject to volumes and the underlying potential of multi-modal logistics among the maritime transit corridors of Ashgabat Convention Member States and CIS countries, there is a potential for Oman to have multiple ports of service to Iran.</p><h4>What is the significance of the move of commercial activities from Port Sultan Qaboos in Muscat to Port Sohar for NFC, and what impact do you expect it to have on the maritime sector?</h4><p>The transformation of Port Sultan Qaboos into a tourism-based, mixed-use waterfront destination provides opportunities for NFC in its future development and growth. Being the capital city, Muscat draws the bulk of tourists, thereby Port Sultan Qaboos is the natural choice for transformation to a tourism port or gateway. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most successful projects for Port Salalah in 2014 and 2015?</h4><p>Overall, productivity was about the same as the previous year, which was positive considering that the Khareef season was longer last year, and typically has a negative impact on productivity. For the coming year we bought two different types of equipment to improve productivity—suction pads and shore tensioners. During the course of 2015 we are expecting our productivity to be less impacted by the Khareef, because of the investments made in this machinery. We are very successful with bulk cargo, as we will handle 12 million tons this year. We handled 10 last year, and will handle 15 next year. To achieve this, we will have new general cargo berths coming on line later this year. We are making investments into automated handling equipment to enable us to turn the vessels around faster and therefore create higher capacity. There is also a new liquids jetty being delivered to us in November this year. We expect to handle a million tons of fuel from that jetty next year, primarily for military aviation and marine fuel. A broad range of liquid cargoes will come as a result of us having this liquids jetty, such as chemicals and petrochemicals. Although the container business is in the doldrums at the moment, the rest of the business is booming. </p><h4>Port Salalah welcomed the 399-m MSC London in the past year. How important was that for Port Salalah as an achievement?</h4><p>The MSC London was good for two reasons. First, it demonstrates the confidence that MSC—our second biggest customer—has in our business. Secondly, the productivity that we achieved on that ship broke all records. We had seven cranes working on it, and turned it around in record time. </p><h4>What are the some of the major investments that have been made by Port Salalah?</h4><p>A new jetty will give us berthing space for our non-core activities, particularly cruises. We have a fairly short but intensive cruise season as the vessels move from the Far East into Europe. We want to develop the cruise season and make business throughout the year. If we can lengthen the cruise season, it will be good for the rest of the community. We are also investing in some automated equipment for the handling of the limestone and gypsum. Not only do we export it as bulk gypsum, there are also manufacturing plants in the Free Zone, which convert it into boards. </p><h4>What are the major plans and expectations for Port Salalah over the next year?</h4><p>The most exciting thing is a development with the dhows. Salalah has quite a strong dhow business. Traditionally, those dhows have gone between Salalah and Somalia, because there are not a lot of developed ports in North Africa. Recently, due to the problems in Yemen, we are handling more dhow business going to Yemen. Around 200 containers come in every week, and we are discharging them into dhows to go to Yemen. We need to develop Salalah not just as a port for Omani cargo, but also for Yemen. Aside from that, we need to convince more people to bring their cargo to Salalah rather than to the Gulf. Salalah is also the third most productive port in West Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key indicators for assessing the performance of Oman Air over the past year?</h4><p>Oman Air's first objective is to ensure that operations are safe. The second is to remain the airline of first choice and, as our market share in Oman has increased, it is clear that this has been a success. The third objective is to make money by increasing revenue and reducing our costs. We have been able to increase revenues over the past year with the addition of aircraft; today, we have 39 aircraft compared to 26 a year ago. The opening of new destinations has been important but our cost drive has ensured that we reduce the overall costs in the organization. This is especially important now since the country's income from hydrocarbons has decreased and state support for Oman Air has been reduced. The fourth objective is to cater for growth. Additional aircraft require new pilots, and workers in the engineering and maintenance departments are required to fit with our new destinations. Additionally, there are also new airports opening in Oman, which we need to support. The fifth objective is to contribute to the wellbeing and economic development of Oman. This relates both to the number of Omanis that we employ and the number of tourists we bring to the country. We have been successful in this area, as last year the government invested $425 million into Oman Air, and our return was over $1 billion to the economy of Oman. In 2015, we are only receiving around $170 million but we will still contribute over $1 billion. All objectives have been reached for 2015.</p><h4>To what extent can Oman air benefit from new airport developments such as at Salalah, and how can the airline contribute to their success?</h4><p>Salalah's new airport is creating a beautiful environment. The retail element is better and the increase in size has made it much less congested. It is certainly catering for the growth of Oman Air and our fleet expansion. For example, our new 787 will operate for the first months to Salalah because our pilots and engineering colleagues need to gain experience. It is a good station since we have our own handling organization with which employees can practice and learn. We are considering combining more destinations such as those in the sub continent via Salalah once we get the bilateral political approval from the Indian government. Muscat today, on the other hand, is completely congested. The new runway is in use but the old runway is being renovated, which creates long taxi waits. The building has constraints, but we have still managed to open a new business-class lounge. A new baggage belt has been added and the departure hall has been extended, which will help us cope while we wait for the opening of the new airport in 2017. Muscat remains our base and is therefore highly important.</p><h4>How do you assess the success of the recent drive to recruit Omani staff at Oman Air?</h4><p>We have 6,418 staff, of which 62% are Omani. We have departments within Oman Air, such as the call center, where 99% are Omani. We also have departments where the Omani employee rate is only 30%, such as cabin crew for instance. We have recently said that we are going to increase the local cabin crew contingent, which will be possible because Oman has friendly citizens for whom hospitality comes naturally. We would like to increase the number of Omani cabin crew by 50%. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important developments in Oman's aviation sector recently, and what role has Oman Airports Management Company played?</h4><p>The government's initiative of developing airports in Muscat, Salalah, Duqm, Sohar, and Ras al Hadd came in support of this vital sector and a belief in its important role in contributing to strengthening the foundations of the Sultanate's economy by creating more opportunities for businesses, especially in the field of logistics and tourism, as well as facilitating better connectivity between Oman and the rest of the world. Airports in Oman, under OAMC, have contributed, in cooperation with our stakeholders, to meeting our targets. OAMC is now a profitable company and has contributed significantly to the government's revenue streams.</p><h4>What will be OAMC's role in the recently established 2040 logistics strategy?</h4><p>As a government company, we will always move according to government initiatives. Our role will be significant due to the government's decision to shift the cargo activities of the Sultan Qaboos Port in Muscat to the Port of Sohar. This means that only air cargo will be received in Muscat, which is our responsibility. When the new airport is complete, we will have better cargo facilities, which will attract major players from around the world. We are also trying to align with the seaports by carrying out air-sea cargo, especially in Salalah, Duqm, and Sohar.</p><h4>How do you cooperate with the government to ensure that aviation supports the promotion of tourism?</h4><p>We believe that Oman's airports are its gates. Therefore, we always work side by side with our stakeholders to insure that the visitors to our beloved country or the traveler though our airports are in a good hands. We have stands and kiosks at each airport operated by the Ministry of Tourism. We follow the trends of passengers and collect statistics on tourist passengers, which are often used to enhance the tourism experience in Oman.</p><h4>How would you assess the current level of domestic and foreign investment coming into the aviation sector?</h4><p>Oman's economic and political stability has increased the attraction of foreign investment. Its ideal location gives us the ability to sell well since we are strategically located between the east and west. With our highly trained teams and cutting-edge status in this field, in addition to the solid infrastructure, we are always facilitating this sector in a professional manner.</p><h4>What are your targets and objectives for the next five years?</h4><p>We are developing a 15-year plan that will be revisited every five years. We wanted it to be a 15-year plan since the aviation sector evolves so quickly and we did not want our plan to become obsolete. We are now pushing to sign a concession agreement with the government for a period of 35 years to allow us to invest in the land around the airport. This area can be utilized for various uses, such as shopping malls, hotels, and conference centers. It can be used for aviation or non-aviation related developments. Due to the development of the major airport in Muscat, the government is keen for us to carry out regular expansion plans after reaching a certain number of passengers. With the government investing heavily in the aviation sector, it will contribute to national development. The new low-cost airline will also give a push to the industry. In addition, we are planning to announce a new license for a second ground handler as well as a second maintenance and repair operator. Generally speaking, we need to provide opportunities for local and foreign investment. One of the most important factors that we continue to focus on is our human capital. We work on developing the caliber of Omani employees and also aim to export this expertise to other airports in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you discuss the role that PACA has played in facilitating phase one of Muscat International Airport?</h4><p>PACA's core business is to act as a regulator for the civil aviation sector. In addition to that, we provide air navigation and meteorology services. For phase one of the new Muscat International Airport, PACA is primarily a regulator. PACA has participated in the early stages of design along with ensuring that all the requirements of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are carried out. PACA is the relevant authority for civil aviation in Oman and can grant certification before an airport is put into operation. We also play a major role in making sure that the air traffic management side is in place, which takes a lot of effort. For example, in Salalah, it took four years to ensure that PACA was ready for the first day of operation. We play a major role in providing meteorological services, which forms a part of our latest undertaking. Coordination in this area is important, as meteorological services provide support to air navigation and is fundamentally important for the sake of saving lives and protecting assets in this country. Oman has a new state-of-the-art center that provides both meteorological services and multi hazard early warnings to reduce the impact of extreme hazards such as tsunamis, tropical cyclones, and flash floods on the Omani people and possibly also for people in neighboring countries. Because Oman is on the Indian Ocean, the weather is sometimes unstable and so our services need to state of the art.</p><h4>There was a recent meeting with the Minister of Transport regarding the challenges of maintaining human resources. What can PACA do to meet this challenge?</h4><p>When there is economic growth in any country, there will be higher turnover rates especially for the government because people have more opportunities. The private sector is always more competitive and potentially more attractive. It is necessary for the government to generate qualified people to go into the private sector—it is the backbone of the economy of any country. We have always tried to increase the level of employee satisfaction. To do that, we have tried to foster employee development, create open communication between management and employees, and recognize and celebrate employees with excellent performance. The new infrastructure, the new building, and new systems are all contributing to create a good working environment. We do not want to be a traditional government organization, and so we try to be creative in that area.</p><h4>In terms of SME support, how does PACA currently interact with SMEs in order to facilitate their development and benefit from their services?</h4><p>The mandate is to allocate 10% of all the tenders to SMEs and we are working hard to adopt that strategy. In civil aviation, however, we deal with highly specialized companies that provide us with a challenge. We look to assign jobs to SMEs especially in the area of event planning and organization. SMEs are also given an opportunity to be involved in providing training and consultancy services for support functions, the development of design materials, websites, and web applications. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Delfin has pioneered expedition cruise tourism in the Peruvian part of the Amazon region over the last decade. What are the current opportunities available for companies operating in the cruise and tourism sector?</h4><p>Peru has different climatic, geographical, and archeological areas, each of them representing an opportunity. Those regions supply unique and varied destinations that have cultural, archeological, geographical, and wildlife potential. Tourism is a much-segmented industry as well, defined by products and experiences, not businesses. There are different layers along the distribution channels before it is possible to reach the final traveller. The first step is local DMCs, or the local travel agency, followed by tour operators abroad, and finally the individual customer, group, or family who seek services and products. Tourists currently seek authenticity and the chance to have an experience more than anything. People do not necessarily want to go to the jungle in the Amazon basin, where we operate, and stay in a five-star hotel. They want to experience the rainforest and do so with a product that is integrated with that environment. In Peru, many make the mistake of still thinking of tourism in the old sense, as just luxury hotels and convenience or comfort. But those choices usually, if not always, lack authentic concepts. Mexico, for example, implemented a program to further increase the inflow of international tourists based on adding value to several small town destinations with strong cultural and archeological content, named “Little Enchanting Towns" and located throughout Mexico. The program consisted of a combined financial effort between central government and the private sector, effectively rescuing the essence of these towns' culture, their history, their architecture, and their authenticity by restoring their main squares as well as surrounding buildings. Afterwards, the private sector became committed to developing small boutique hotels and restaurants. Everything was restored using the original materials and architectural designs from the marketplace's past history. And it worked, as this way they were turned into unique and very much authentic new destinations true to their essence and their particular feel. These are all key content elements to provide travelers with what they want; unique authentic experiences. San Cristobal de las Casas was one of the most famous examples, and today hundreds of thousands of tourists visit that little town year round. Another example is the small fishing town of Trancoso in Bajia, Brazil. We need to do the same thing here in Peru. We need to implement these kinds of programs to provide the private sector the grounds to develop new, long-lasting, and high value-added businesses in the tourism sector. We must stop the indiscriminate building growth of infrastructure at large in most of Peru's towns, which boast a tremendous historic architectural and cultural heritage. Opposite to San Cristobal de las Casas in Mexico and Trancoso in Bajia, Brazil, because of the lack of a central administration, clear vision, and master plan for tourism, almost all new construction is rather quickly destroying all these places' potential as new, attractive destinations for international travel. Instead, we must renovate what needs to be renovated, regenerate the city centers where needed, as well as add infrastructure such as boutique accommodations while mandatorily rescuing their true architectural essence. Unfortunately there isn't a central administration master plan for the tourism sector. We do not even have a Ministry of Tourism, although we do have a Vice-Ministry of Tourism as part of the Ministry of Foreign Trade, Commerce &amp; Tourism. This Office has the ability and the will to assist the private sector contribute to these kinds of projects, but the existing political structure is too segmented and convoluted, thus restraining their efforts in this direction. In Peru, ministers do not have the power to regulate anything specific in any region or part of Peru; they can only make suggestions as the decision-making power is all in the hands of the regional governments.</p><h4>What segments do you target at Delfin?</h4><p>We target the high-end segment because that is where we are most comfortable in terms of risk, revenue generation, and profitability. The upper segment, characterized by small-size businesses, high prices, and high margins meets our conditions and vision of moving forward and upward. It is also important for conservation and preservation. All of Peru's most famous, precious, and popular destinations are located in places that cannot handle large numbers of tourists. Machu Picchu, Arequipa, Nazca, Trujillo, Chiclayo, and the Amazon are all the fantastic places but all of these destinations are all very delicate and fragile and they can't sustain large volumes. That is why we target the high-end segment, because these places are not suited to mainstream markets.</p><h4>How do you overcome the lack of qualified personnel and human resources in Peru?</h4><p>Tourism is generally not considered a viable career for well-educated professionals, so finding the right people can be difficult. And yet you have to be every bit as professional and corporate in tourism as in any other sector, especially if you want to grow, improve, and prosper. Unfortunately, the schools that offer tourism courses do not provide an adequate curriculum. They have to be more corporate. We need to do more work marketing the sector well. The regulations, taxes, and legal framework all require highly trained, dedicated, and top-notch professionals. We need to attract more people to the industry, educate and train them at a higher level, and also lay the framework for a better, more centralized, and more efficient decision-making apparatus that has the capacity to create and follow strategic long-term visions. Countries in the same region as Peru and close by ones such as Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Argentina, Brazil, Panama, and Costa Rica are far ahead of us in this sense, and they do not have destinations that are on par with what we have in Peru. It is a competitive world and region overall, with Ecuador's Galapagos, Brazil's rainforest, Argentina and Chile's Patagonia region, and Costa Rica and Panama's protected natural reserves. So we need to react by introducing serious changes in Peru's political structure and decision-making process with regards to tourism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Madina Group continued to diversify its operations over the past year?</h4><p>We are progressing well, and as our printing press is privately owned, it is convenient for government agencies to work with us. Given the rising concern for confidentiality, we have increased exports of our security document products to other emerging countries, where rapid development is evident. As companies travel further afield, they become more demanding in light of practices and services observed abroad. This is a welcome development for a company such as ours.</p><h4>How would you assess the transition to e-government, and how is Al Madina supporting this process?</h4><p>Under the direction of His Majesty Sultan Qaboos Bin Said's wise vision to further develop the e-government services electronically, we have participated in several projects whereby promoting efficient, reliable, and secure eservices to benefit the public.  We are committed to the vision of His Majesty to support the national initiative of developing national human capital in the transition to e-government.</p><h4>Where do you see Oman's position in terms of the evolution of e-commerce?</h4><p>There have been many e-commerce projects awarded in the last few years.  We have been successful in our e-solutions and as a result have received an award from Bank Muscat as the best e-commerce merchant for 2014. We are also excited about other e-solutions such as smartphone solutions. Though more will be disclosed in due course, we are tying up with international technology providers in certain countries for other markets.</p><h4>Which industries have the greatest demand for your services?</h4><p>Governments provide the most demand for our services. We have created platforms for many sectors such as energy, education, health, insurance, and securities. Many projects are related to portals with electronic data management systems in order to implement different types of statistical data analysis systems. </p><h4>According to industry data, 19% of students in Oman are engaged in IT-related majors. How is this impacting your ability to recruit and train staff?</h4><p>We have received requests from colleges and members of the general public requesting the provision of training, which we are more than happy to provide. However, when it comes to some of our projects, there is such a short timeframe to develop and deploy a solution that we don't have the luxury of time for the training and learning curve period which can sometimes be quite long. As required, we do send our staff abroad for training with our international partners for specific projects.</p><h4>What are Al Madina Group's competitive advantages?</h4><p>Within our company we have 11 nationalities, each with its own unique culture; each employee brings something different to the table. This diversity makes our company unique and strongly placed to arrive at solutions, and this has helped us penetrate new markets. For example, we may likely have an employee from a particular country we want to do business in. This can dramatically ease communication and increase access to markets. </p><h4>What parts of the world are important for medium-term growth?</h4><p>All countries in the world are important, and with the internet it has become very easy to connect with others to create business opportunities. I have personally travelled to 31 countries for collaboration, conferences, and meetings with suppliers and customers. We have been approached by delegates from abroad, most recently South America and Caribbean countries, so there is always a way to work together on small- and large-scale projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Omantel had an excellent year in 2014, surpassing estimates in various areas. What role has management played in these successes?</h4><p>From a financial perspective, 2014 was indeed successful. Domestic revenue grew by around 4%, with net profit growing by a margin of 2.6%, which is the highest growth rate in the last five years. What has driven this for Omantel is the growth we have seen in mobile broadband and fixed broadband. These have grown in double digits, about 30% for both. Our corporate business segment has also seen strong growth, with the enterprise increasing by approximately 7% YoY. These are the main drivers. We have been able to achieve these successes through an integrated operating model that we have applied since 2009, offering our services to the three main segments on the market: consumers, corporate, and wholesale. Apart from that, we have also invested in three main areas of infrastructure.</p><h4>What do you expect these new investments to bring to Omantel?</h4><p>We looked at the challenges as well as the opportunities. A quick analysis of the telecoms market shows that we will continue to see traditional competition. There is also a new kind of competition, the so-called over the top (OTT) players, which includes the likes of Google, Facebook, and Viber. OTT players use the infrastructure of a telecoms operators without playing by the same rules. This is an interesting challenge for us, because it increases demand for both mobile broadband and fixed broadband services, and at the same time puts a lot of pressure on our infrastructure demanding additional investments. In order to deal with these changing conditions, we developed our new strategy: Omantel 3.0. The company has grown through three major transformations in the last 15 years. The first major transformation involved our IPO and listing on the Muscat Stock Exchange, which transformed us from a public company to a private entity. The second major transformation was in 2009, with the creation of an integrated operating model for the three main customer segments, consumer, corporate, and wholesale. The third major transformation, Omantel 3.0, will take us beyond connectivity.</p><h4>How do you plan to organize this new strategy?</h4><p>Our strategy is based on four pillars. The first pillar is the customer, who is at the center of any strategy. With Omantel 3.0, our ambition is to exceed the expectation of our customers. The sophistication we see in the market today requires new approaches and strategies. Mass markets are becoming more specific macro markets, like, for example, expats. Then you have micro segments where, for example, you will divide the expat segment into low-, medium-, and high-income segments. By 2020, the market will evolve to a place where each individual person will become a segment on their own and will require personalized solutions. Big Data will enable us to service the customer in this new “I“ segment. The second pillar relates to digital transformation of Oman, and about Omantel playing a leading role in this. Oman's government is committed to e-government and digital solutions to achieve their mission, and we want to bring the latest technologies and solutions to the market in order to enable everyone in Oman to interact digitally, independent of technology or location. The third pillar is that of innovation. With the “I“ segment, the digital transformation, and the internet, the companies that will survive will be the ones that can innovate and provide relevant solutions to their customers. The fourth pillar is agility. Agility is required to respond quickly and efficiently to the rapidly changing market conditions and customer requirements. We will focus on investing in our people, streamlining and automating our processes and assure that our infrastructure and operation is efficient and sustainable. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the role that ITA has played, especially over the past year?</h4><p>Our government network is being enhanced currently by working closely with Oman's Broadband Company (OBC) and other providers to connect all government agencies to optic fiber. We signed the first phase of the high-speed government network with OBC to implement and operate the current active network. The first phase of this implementation will cover 63 HQs for all government organizations in Muscat, replacing the current lower speeds of Oman Government Network. The new network will connect the mentioned HQs with the previous 1GB connectivity and will connect them to the ITA National Data Center (NDC) with a 10 GB backbone. This new service will enable government organizations to enhance the service quality and achieve better customer satisfaction for their provided services.</p><p>Part of this year's plan was complementing some of the latest trends in technology, such as the Government Cloud. We are also focusing on how to effectively use big data to help government agencies reach their audiences, as well as increasing the efficiency of the eTransformation projects. Another major focus is on SMEs in order to bring new technology and development to Oman. Hence, we need to make sure that knowledge transfer is carried out successfully, as 10% of any business contract by big international companies is to be allocated to SMEs. </p><h4>Looking at eGovernment, what are some of the major successes that ITA can showcase?</h4><p>The eGovernment transformation plan is focusing on integration between government entities. We have 10 core organizations that have been already integrated as part of the InvestEasy system, including municipalities, the Ministry of Manpower, the Chamber of Commerce, and other government entities. Oman has been awarded internationally over the past six years, as we have been using these systems effectively. For example, with the Ministry of Education, the educational portal can be used for many purposes. It will be available as a mobile app to enhance services, which is part of an approach that differentiates us. As it is an integrated approach, we invest only once in this type of system.</p><h4>How does ITA educate SMEs and communicate the opportunities that are available in the sector?</h4><p>We have an intelligent young population in Oman and all they need is to have the opportunity. We built a Virtual Reality Center and we are pushing young people toward these new technologies. Young people realize that whenever they get along with our support, they become a valuable asset, even for major companies which are always hunting for new talent. SMEs understand that if they deliver high quality products and services, then their business will develop and grow, and if not, then their business will suffer. We give SMEs a maximum of three years to graduate and move into the market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2015? What is your long-term outlook for ITA and the sector?</h4><p>Things are moving in the right direction. We are responsible for the eOman strategy, but the broadband strategy is also complementing our work. For example, Omantel has announced 4.5G and that means we will have a higher network speed on both mobile and fiber. Oman Broadband Company has united with Ooredoo and Omantel, as they do not need to reinvest in infrastructure. As a government agency, we are already investing in undergoing sewerage system, the water system, and the roads by putting in fiber at the same time. A mandate by the end of 2015 will evaluate them and put in a transparent report as to who has achieved their goals and who has not. In January 2016, we should be able to announce more eGovernment services. </p><h4>Could you pinpoint two important themes for the ICT sector in 2016?</h4><p>The process of eTransformation is an important milestone that we are focusing on. In industrial and capacity development, SMEs are another focus. We will launch a mobile Applications Development Center of Excellence soon which will teach young people to develop and create companies that are specialized in mobility in all the services for the public and private sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the modern era, ICT plays a pivotal role in the development of each industry. How successful has Oman's ICT sector been in supporting the country's recent economic development?</h4><p><span></span>The telecoms sector has been a major player in the development of the Omani economy. In the past years the telecoms sector has been the backbone to the success of the (e.Oman) the electronic government initiatives that provide the government services through electronic platforms, which are accessible to the public from anywhere and anytime. For the government, investment in the ICT sector is a fundamental policy goal, alongside transformation, diversity, and universal access. In order to ensure a sustainable investment environment, it is critical for government to create an enabling policy environment. This includes establishing proper investment policy and regulations, building research and development capacity, and promoting innovation. The effects of competitive pressure and regulatory changes in the telecoms sector, the rapidly rising demand for data services, and investments made in manpower and telecoms infrastructure have all been positive for all the stakeholders concerned, the users of the telecommunications services, the investors, and the government. The TRA is working toward rationalizing regulatory regimes by reviewing the Licensing Framework, the Competition Framework, the amendments of the Telecom Act, and other key regulations to foster economic and technological development in the country. The government is also working on many initiatives and is also working on the broadband policy to reduce the digital divide between rural and urban areas. Apart from providing basic and telecommunications needs, this initiative is expected to aid the social and economic development efforts of the government.</p><h4>How positive has SME development been in the ICT sector, and what have been the major achievements by the Ministry in this area over the past year?</h4><p>SMEs have been recognized as a key player in economic development at large and the ICT sector in particular. There have been various forms of SMEs emerging in the sector. Besides the investment in the service provision (telephone and internet/mobile or fixed), there have been other SMEs that focus on the sale and maintenance of equipment, service connection, applications, software, and hardware, and they have emerged in response to the growth in the sector. Moreover, there have been other enterprises/investments that focus primarily on education and training to develop local skills and specialized human resources.</p><h4>How will online government services develop in the future?</h4><p>Government services will be transformed and made more efficient, automated, and offered online to citizens, businesses, employees, and other government agencies. eServices shall be fully integrated end-to-end across agencies and offered in a seamless manner online with high level of availability, security, and usability. Access to services will be structured and offered through a unified and common government look and feel and made available via different channels with a focus on mobility and self-service. Government infrastructure and applications will be modernized and made more compliant to common government standards published by ITA and will be geared toward achieving service automation, efficiency, and the desired level of business continuity while utilizing common components and building blocks. Systems will be linked and integrated via a high-speed secured government network and offer a high degree of availability and resilience to disruptive events. Government IT staff will be highly trained and able to operate increasingly complex infrastructures whether run in-house or outsourced through training and skills development programs aligned with the utilized technology and architecture standard. Political will, as expressed by His Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said and demonstrated in creating HM National Award for Excellence in eGovernment, has been instrumental in fostering various initiatives in Oman (governmental, private, and civil), enabling the country to achieve the current level of penetration and readiness.</p><h4>How has the ICT sector supported the development of bilateral ties between Oman and the international community?</h4><p>Oman and the international community have very strong ties in different fields, such as economic, cultural, and scientific cooperation and the ICT sector enjoys stability and economic growth as a result. Other countries see Oman as a reliable partner with which they can exchange views on all major economic developments. Over the years, Oman has signed bilateral agreements in the ICT sector with many different Gulf and international communities and holds annual meetings as part of its continuing negotiations to develop business and economic relations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide some details regarding the physical expansion of AVOD over the past year?</h4><p>We invested in logistics as this is one of the key advantages of Oman's location on the Arabian Sea. We constructed an automated warehouse for room temperature and refrigerated goods, alongside Muscat Expressway, with cutting-edge technology. No other warehouse like it exists in Oman today. The target was to get the most cost-effective warehousing and logistics system working and the system is already operating. Commissioning automated systems takes time, due to the training required.</p><h4>How will the new facilities be cutting edge and cost effective?</h4><p>The customer sees the benefit of our logistics system if a fast response and on-time delivery is made. The customer is also concerned about costs, and we need to operate at a cost lower than that of our competitors. We use the well known ERP system SAP, and there are warehouse modules that the SAP system has to interact with. These are very sophisticated standalone modules that need to be operated expertly in order for us to work seamlessly. To integrate these new automatic standalone systems with SAP, highly sophisticated IT technology is required, which we have installed.</p><h4>To what extent do you think a strong logistics system can increase and strengthen your export profile?</h4><p>The bulk of our exports go to GCC countries, with the Middle East market increasing as a whole. We can now load 10 trucks at a time, simultaneously, meaning we can dispatch 50 trucks during a shift with the system because five trucks can be loaded at each bay. We can also take advantage of the Arabian Sea and the Gulf. Marine transport to India, Pakistan and West Africa is very cheap and we can use any port, whether that is Muscat and Sohar in Oman, or Jebel Ali and Sharjah in the UAE.</p><h4>AVOD visited Ethiopia to look at the possibilities of entering that market earlier in 2015. What was your overall opinion of the country as a potential market?</h4><p>We are currently exploring and developing the Ethiopian market. There is a segment in Ethiopia, the larger supermarkets in particular, that is suitable for our brands. AVOD also works closely with multinational brands, such as Unilever, Heinz, and Kraft so as to take care of their needs in markets like Ethiopia.</p><h4>What do AVOD's new products bring to the market, and how well have they been received?</h4><p>In the developed world competition is fought by implementing innovation in product, packaging and marketing. For product and packaging technology, we have invested in the facilities necessary to make cheap and clear oils. Their launch has been promising and has achieved good results in the biggest market in the region, Saudi Arabia. In Oman and UAE, the process has been a little slower. We are committed to giving the customer a good deal on price, health, and quality. We stopped hydrogenation 10 years ago, and have replaced it with a heart-friendly process called interesterification. We were ahead of the market, as it is only now that bans on “transfats" have officially come into effect in the US and Europe. Our cutting-edge technology is to deliver cheap products to the bulk of consumers without these harmful hydrogenated fats. It is a healthier and cheaper option.</p><h4>How does AVOD implement the necessary training procedures?</h4><p>We are a specialized industry and the only way to achieve our goals is to train our staff ourselves. We have opened up a professional training center here at which we train people. Professional trainers come to help our team, train people in the classroom, and then put them on the job as assistants for up to two years to gain hands-on experience. We are concentrating on developing Omanis and local talent, and we look to hire from the local market. We train them both in the classroom and in the factory. Food safety regulations are developing fast and hygiene standards are constantly improving. So we need to continually train our employees. It is recognized that an organization that is training for industrial safety in the oil and gas industry will not be able to help with the safety of hygiene in food plants; we have to do it ourselves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Winterfell recently purchased shares of the company. What is the significance of this acquisition, and how will it impact Efacec's operations?</h4><p>The acquisition by our new shareholders was important for our company. It provides a breath of fresh air into the company. Nowadays, we are refocusing our strategies and of course, for Africa, it is positive as the new shareholders are from Angola. We all expect that even though the strategy of the company will allow us to maintain interest in European markets, the company will also address business in Africa in a stronger way.</p><h4>What is the significance of the southern African market, specifically for Mozambique?</h4><p>The Mozambican market is responsible for less than 10% of the company's turnover, but it is growing. We believe that there are multiple opportunities available, not just in Mozambique, but across southern Africa as a whole. We expect that the significance of these markets will grow inside our company.</p><h4>Power supply is a major challenge in Mozambique. In which way are you working with EDM and Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa (HCB) to improve access to electricity in the country?</h4><p>At the moment it is quite challenging because of the characteristics of the market, not just in the Mozambican economy, but all over Africa. The first challenge is to maintain the assets, to implement strategies to keep the assets fit, and to allow them to last longer so that the main investment can be directed toward other assets. In this particular field, we have been partnering with Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa for a couple of years. We are renewing all of the power transformers at the power plant and training Mozambicans perform these tasks. We are also doing asset maintenance with EDM, with whom we started slightly later. The government has a lot of challenges ahead, such as the financing, the exchange rate, credit capacity, and so on. We try our best to partner with local institutions to implement projects successfully, but this is a major challenge when local entities have no capacity to sign credit.</p><h4>What role did you play in the expansion of the Coca Cola factory?</h4><p>The project is a milestone for Mozambique and we are proud to cooperate once again with Coca Cola, which is a client of ours in several other countries as well. Coca Cola is a trendsetter worldwide, and we also consider it as an alliance. In Mozambique, we applied all the medium-voltage equipment and power transformers to the project. One thing that we underline in this project is the involvement of local people. Companies stress that skilled people are hard to find in Mozambique and that education is a considerable challenge, but we were happy that Coca Cola has been successful in addressing it. We had the possibility to train local technicians from Coca Cola's staff for the maintenance of the factory and our equipment, which is quite relevant, and we are very happy with that.</p><h4>What important projects do you have lined up for the coming years?</h4><p>The challenge is substantial when you realize that only 50% of the population has access to potable water, for example, and even less than that have access to electricity. These are the sectors that we are prioritizing in Mozambique—electricity and water. We are planning to expand our activities, reinforce the team, and expand the influence of EFACEC from the main cities to all the provinces where relevant projects are underway. In the past, we were concentrated around Maputo, where most of the investment is, and in the past few years we have cooperated with local authorities to reinforce the high voltage electrical network around the capital. We were in a JV with other companies to expand the water treatment plant in Umbeluzi. Now it is time to go north and to take on the opportunities and challenges that are happening there.</p><h4>What provinces will benefit the most from your efforts over the next five years?</h4><p>We stay in line with the government's strategy and the evolution of the economy and investment trends. There are a number of sectors in Mozambique that will become more relevant in the future, like gas. They depend a lot on global market prices and, nowadays, Mozambique is in a difficult situation because coal and gas prices are down, and this is not helping projects to develop. These sectors are localized, like coal in Tete province and gas in Cabo Delgado. We have to recognize that big investments mobilize the entire economy and, when you are mobilizing the entire economy, you have to provide people with power and water. But even when these big investments are delayed, power is still a critical issue all over the country. We always have to properly address these challenges and the evolution of market demand. There are other sectors that the government is trying to develop, like agriculture and agro-industries. They are key drivers of development and require power and water to expand.</p><h4>What role will the Mphanda Nkuwa Dam play in the coming years?</h4><p>The Mphanda Nkuwa Dam is a project on the Zambezi River, which is one of the main rivers on the continent. Mphanda Nkuwa, together with the Cahora Bassa North Bank, is both important for Mozambique and the southern Africa region as a whole for power generation. It is also crucial for controlling the course of the river in Mozambique and helping to avoid floods. The process of building a large dam like Mphanda Nkuwa is long and complex and requires huge investment. One needs to learn from other projects completed before, such as Cahora Bassa, and use the knowledge that was acquired when negotiating the power purchase agreements and the financing. If we learn from the past, we can speed up in the future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

We had been looking for opportunities to work outside of India and the opportunity arose in Oman. Here, a plant was already partly built as the previous investors had run out of money, and thus it was for sale. We made the acquisition in 2010 and production started in January 2011. The Sohar Port is of logistical importance to the region, and we entered into the Omani market as part of a decided strategy. Sohar Port has a jetty that can be used for large cargo and it has geo-political centrality. Another factor that influenced our investment decision is the availability of natural gas in Oman, a vital resource component for our supply-chain. The positive approach of Oman's government also demonstrated that this was the right place to invest. </p><h4>What will be the long-term benefits of Jindal's $2 billion investment in Oman?</h4><p>When we took over the plant, it was set up to produce HBI, an iron ore product that heavy industry uses to produce steel. However, HBI is not directly marketable to consumers. Therefore, we invested a large amount of money into setting up a steel producing shop to use the HBI. The facility is currently set up to produce 1.5 million tons of HBI and with the steel shop we will be able to produce 2 million tons of steel. Our products are now marketable to a wide range of consumers. In the future we will be producing goods such as rebar and wire rods. We are moving towards taking a raw material to a finished product and working through the whole supply-chain to meet the needs of the entire region. We are also researching alternate energy sources, due to gas shortages in Oman.</p><h4>Can you provide details on the balance between Jindal's domestic market and exports overseas?</h4><p>Steel demand is increasing in the GCC region. The UAE and Oman are large procurers of steel and our target is to meet their requirements. Demand has also grown in Africa, especially in the North African region where we already have a market presence. During our sole HBI production phase, our main export pool was Italy and Egypt. Our finished steel product will be of great benefit to the GCC area and of no detriment to our current, more internationally based clientele. What type of balance are you planning on between your upstream, downstream, and midstream production?</p><p>Having a well balanced, flexible product inventory is our competitive edge. The diversification of HBI into steel production has enabled us to take further steps towards our objective of creating speciality products, such as rebar. Saudi Arabia has recently built an HBI manufacturing facility, yet they lack the resources for the production phase. Our aim is to supply their plant with HBI, and provide steel supplies also. As the oil price has declined, the price of pipes has decreased in correlation. We are increasing our production flexibility and export outlook in order to weather these changes in market conditions.</p><h4>Jindal had acquired a $725 million loan from Bank Muscat. How was that partnership formed and what will be the mutual benefits?</h4><p>We have a strong relationship with Bank Muscat and they are also happy with our performance. They provided us with financial capital since the formation of our steel shop. We have a strong, open and transparent working relationship.</p><h4>What other targets and expectations do you have?</h4><p>The main thing we need to work on is our steel department, and we have a shortage of material so we have to import at times. The price of scrap metal is low so we continue to look for ways to diversify our inventory. Another target is to work closer with the government on environmental policies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you give us a brief overview regarding your core products and geographical presence?</h4><p>Gulf Mining is considered one of the prime mining companies in Oman. We started operations in 2005 as a small company with only five employees, while now we have approximately 700 employees. In 2005, we only produced laterite, which we would sell to National Cement in the UAE. Production ranged from 20-27,000 tons according to the requirements of the cement factory. However, we decided to diversify and started producing chrome at a time when the government opened up for the private sector to invest. Our first shipment of chrome was to China in the middle of 2005 and was only 500 tons. From that time, we switched entirely from laterite to chrome as it was more lucrative. We had a concession in Wadi Mahram, which is in the Syma area in Dakhlia. From there, we increased our production from 500 tons to our average today of 20-25,000 tons of high grade and 7,000 tons of low grade, as well as the adopted concentrated plants. The first one opened in 2010, with the Undersecretary of Commerce &amp; Industry. Our production levels are between 4-5,000 tons of concentrated material per month. As there is not much market for the low-grade produce, we have had to add value to it. We created a Chrome Ore Beneficiation (COB) plant to upgrade our material as a result. At the time, the prices were rewarding, but now there is a lot of competition, especially after South Africa opened up the market. There was then an idea to implement a ferrochrome plant in 2011. Our first initiative had many obstacles, especially as some public officials said that Oman was not ready for that kind of industry. We decided to shift it to the Sohar Freezone as recommended by the Ministry of Environment, and operations started in 2013. Financial support was provided by National Bank of Oman, and we also invested. The factory itself opened in January 2015.</p><h4>How do Gulf Mining's operations outside of Oman differ from in Oman?</h4><p>Internationally, we have already approached a few countries. We have some investments in Egypt with two mines, one in marble and one in granite. They also produce blocks and sell to the development market; it would also be possible to export. Secondly, we have some investments in Albania and have invested about $2 million in nickel mines. We have offices in Shanghai and Shenzen in China, as well as an office in Dubai. Those are mainly trading offices because we want to look after our material all the way from the loading port to the dispatching port. We have increased our production, but unfortunately the price has dropped tremendously because of the international market situation. The government is trying to focus more on the mining sector being a major contributor to the Oman economy. Gulf Mining management decided not only to concentrate on chrome, but also to invest in other materials available in Oman. For example, we invested in manganese when I took over the management of the group in early 2015. We started with 3,000 tons, and are now averaging around 10,000 tons per month. By 2016, the plan is to produce around 15,000 tons on a monthly basis.</p><h4>What areas of the mining sector would be the most lucrative for foreign investors?</h4><p>A good example is that Savannah from Australia found gold and copper ore earlier in 2015. They now want us as a partner. The government has certainly opened up in terms of foreign investors, although in terms of chrome, there are no more mines left. We are the largest producers at around 66,000 tons and Gulf Mining has more than 60% of the market share. There are many opportunities in gypsum, and there are already some partnerships with American investors. We have also entered into this kind of business and now have one quarry and a partnership with the locals. We produce about 50,000 tons per month out of a total of around 700,000 tons produced in month in Oman. It is a small amount for now; however, we are planning to increase our production to 150,000-200,000 tons within the next two years. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the PAM since it was established and what have been the main milestones?</h4><p>The establishment of PAM itself is an enforcement of the vision of the government to give the mining sector more focus and attention and to enable it to contribute to the economy of the country, which has been low so far. Although the establishment happened one year ago, the achievements of the authority since then have been very substantial for the mining sector and one of the biggest achievements since then has been drafting the new mining law, which is currently in the process of endorsement. The second aspect is that in order for the PAM to provide the right and efficient services to investors, it requires an organizational structure capable of providing such structure. Therefore, the Authority has finished the new organizational structure. Mining licenses need a bit of restructuring in terms of the processes and we have been dealing with the restructuring of these processes in accordance with the old law, but eventually it will take on its own kind of restructuring process as per the new mining law. At least for the mid-term, we will be able to provide better services for new licensing, and we will be very clear about what the requirements are for those licenses. Another quick win is to provide quick services for license renewal through more coordination between the concerned government entities. </p><h4>How will PAM support local and foreign companies once they are on the ground?</h4><p>One of the things that local and foreign investors always face is the slow process of applications for mining licenses. We need to be dynamic in terms of coordinating between the entities as we should not really leave it to just sending letters. We have to physically meet with the people to pass the right messages of the importance of such kinds of investment. Sometimes there are bigger benefits from the investment than the small adverse effect, which can be mitigated against by some kind of measures. A physical interaction, closer coordination, and making the concerned entity aware of the bigger benefits of this investment is my approach. The second thing is that we need to ensure that the investor is clear on the requirements before proceeding on commitments; because sometimes the investor is not clear on what is required. We are open toward foreign investors and we welcome their technical experience and skills. We are also willing to share with them the information about mining opportunities. </p><h4>How transparent will the Omani mining industry be to future investors?</h4><p>We would like to advocate transparency by creating a network through which you can find all mining blocks that are occupied and all the potential sites that are open for investment so you can immediately choose what you want. Also, the new mining law is clear and transparent. It clearly and in details specifies the rights and obligations for the license holder. Additionally the law provides the mechanisms of sorting out any conflicts that might arise during the mining operations. In addition there will be very clear and transparent criteria for selecting the winning investment proposal. All of these will provide transparency on our process and procedures, which will enable attraction for investment in the mining sector.</p><h4>What are the goals you would like to achieve for 2016?</h4><p>The short and medium-term milestones are to put the new mining law in operation, complete the mining strategy, restructuring of the process of issuing and renewal of mining license, and filling the organization with the right skills and talents which are required to transform the quality of the service we provide. Additionally, we want to start creating an attractive investment environment to enable attracting big foreign and local investments, which are required for the exploration of minerals. </p><p>Added value is another focus for 2016, and we are doing studies of different minerals to find out what is the best way to invest in these minerals. We also endeavor to establish a public mining development company, offering some share to the public and creating a genuine partnership between the government, the private sector, and citizens. In addition it will create healthy competition within the mining sector. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does Majis Industrial Services play in the water sector, and what contribution is the company making to the development of the economy?</h4><p>Majis was established in 2006 to provide water solutions to the industrial port of Sohar. A few years later, we extended that service to the Sohar Freezone. Majis is currently serving five water-related products. The first product is cooling water, which is sea water cleaned of marine life and debris, which is pumped to the customer for cooling purposes and then pumped back into the sea. We pump close to 320,000cbm of water per hour, and there are no additives to the water except chlorine. The second product is drinking water, which we produce in a small osmosis plant. We pump 11,000cbm per day to the government water grid, in order to contribute the water supply to the general public. The third element is processed water with no chemical additives, and we provide around 10,000cbm per day directly to customers after reverse osmosis. We are also collecting the domestic water waste, which is the fourth element. We are currently building facilities to collect this water, and separating solids from the liquid. The liquid, after waste and chemicals have been removed, is sent back to some customers for irrigation processes; this is the fifth element. Unfortunately at this time, the solid waste is sent to the waste yard, though we are considering making fertilizer with it. We currently serve roughly 30 customers with diverse needs. </p><h4>What is the status of the seawater intake facility construction that Majis has been developing and what benefits do you expect this facility to bring?</h4><p>The facility is developing well, and we have not had to deviate from our timeline. The project itself is customer oriented, and we are not investing before the demand peaks. The driver of this project is the expansion of the Sohar refinery. The water treatment plant is called SWIP. These projects are all taking water from the facility under construction and this new facility has the capacity to accommodate around 400,000cbm of water per hour, being able to produce around 700,000cbm between the two plants. We expect that when Majis expands, our revenue and asset value will improve accordingly. The asset value is now around $130 million, and this would add another $104 million. For the country, this is a must in order to accommodate customers. Without our investment, customers will have difficulties sourcing the water, and cooling and processing happens through us. </p><h4>What are the key transformational changes happening in the water sector?</h4><p>We are looking forward to the unbundling of the water sector and are striving for a decentralized water sector. People become too relaxed under centralization, and we feel that the challenge of competition inspires innovation and will be highly beneficial to the sector. </p><h4>What challenges exist in the sector for water management and what adaptations are you making accordingly?</h4><p>The challenges at the moment involve the cost of power and water. Costs are quite high, and technology evolvement, specifically solar, will offset this. Reverse osmosis eased the cost of using heat technology, which generated more electricity. Especially in this area, it is important to know the best way to make desalinated water. Reverse osmosis continues to move forward, but using it with solar technology will present more opportunities. The community needs to come up with creative solutions to make the production of water more affordable. Production should be privatized and immediately go to the dilution stage. We need one or two years as a transitional period but the way forward is by decentralizing the production of water and encouraging customers to conserve use. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you outline something of the background to the core business of OETC?</h4><p>Our key function is to transport electricity from the generation at power plants around Oman to the distribution customers. We are also responsible for the controlling and dispatching of electrical energy from all of these power plants as well as controlling the transmission system. Our main role and responsibility is to make sure that we transport electricity in a highly reliable and efficient way to the customer. </p><h4>When being formed, can you pinpoint some highlights OETC has had?</h4><p>OETC was formed in 2005, and it came with a license from the Authority for Electricity Regulation. We made a lot of investments to keep up with the growth and demand for electricity and we control the expansion of our network to fulfill all requirements. In January 2014, OETC went through a major change by taking over the transmission system in the south of Oman. </p><h4>Looking at December 2014, there were some contracts worth around $228 million, which you signed with various companies for new construction. Can you discuss how that has developed your input into the power sector?</h4><p>We are currently adding new projects to the pipeline, some of which will be no less than $260 million. We are targeting local and international companies to make investments in these projects, as it is important to have a balance. As for local companies, we encourage new contractors and expect them to participate in new projects. Part of our license is to build the network, ensuring that the generation delivers power through the grid. In the coming three years, we expect to invest more than $780 million to allow us to evacuate the power for a new generation coming in the North of Oman, namely in Ibri and Sohar. </p><h4>What are your thoughts regarding the rising demand for electricity in Oman demand? Is it possible to keep up with it in the medium term?</h4><p>The demand has come from the development of the country and the high growth, especially from the industrial sector. We have good planning to keep up with the demand and we have a long term Master Plan (up to 2030) as well as producing a five-year capability statement that is in line with the Master Plan. Accordingly, we consult with the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company and distribution companies which provide us with the forecasting for generation and demand respectively. </p><h4>This year saw a 10-year bond issue for OETC. Can you provide some details regarding what the impact of this will be?</h4><p>There has been an increase of capital acquirement within OETC, as we have been gearing toward significant expansion over the coming five years. We have therefore decided to increase our long-term funding. The 10-year bond will help us to finance future projects, most of which will happen in 2016, as well as settle some of the short-term loans that we have taken from local banks. We have had great success, which will help us for 10 more years. </p><h4>Regarding the transmission of electricity in Oman, what are the major challenges that you face and what are your projects to mitigate these concerns?</h4><p>Most of the challenges we face relate to getting the right corridors. We are struggling with the government regarding getting the right corridor for our transmission network. We also face challenges with contractors; contractors in Oman are overloaded with projects at the moment, so there are not enough to take on the challenge of expansion and new projects. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you talk about some of the most significant contracts that you have been involved in, in order to develop the operations of Haya Water?</h4><p>Over the past 12 months we have awarded a number of projects. Two were awarded in Al Alamerat, among them an STP project, which we awarded to a joint venture, a French company and a local company. We are proud of this JV, because it consists of one international party with a lot of experience in designing, building and operating STPs, and a local company that has limited experience in STP projects. There will be a lot of knowledge transfer from the international company to the local partner, which will help the Oman economy. We also recently awarded a project to expand our STP in Al Ansab to the Korean company Doosan. This is a fast-track project, which must be finished within 24 months. This sort of project has a lot of challenges because it is a brown field project. Working in a live plant with this kind of equipment brings a lot of challenges to us from both an HSE position, as well as from an operational point of view. This needs to be managed carefully. We also awarded two projects in Seeb in the past 12 months and a project which involves building sea outfall in Darsait in Adaiba. The past 12 months have rendered a significant number of projects. There is huge demand at the moment for a connection in Wilayat Bosher and we have already reached ultimate capacity. </p><h4>From a managerial perspective, what are some of the technical challenges that you face? </h4><p>Finding consultants and contractors is challenging, those are key areas, and we are trying to deal with them through workshops and by attending conferences. The topography of Muscat is a challenge as well. We must dig as deep as 18 to 20 meters. The route we select is crucial as well, as the sewage flow is by gravity and not by pressure. We also face challenges with not disrupting the home-life of the general public. We still need proper drawings and documentation of the utilities and undergrounds services. Another challenge is NOCs, because sometimes we need huge numbers of NOCs to do projects. The topography of Muscat cannot be changed, but the rest of the challenges we are focusing on and trying to work on. </p><h4>Can you discuss the selection process you go through to bring qualified contractors on board?</h4><p>First of all we operate a transparent tendering process. Everyone can track what is happening with a project. As far as making sure that we have the right service provided, we do a proper evaluation of qualifications of the rejected bids. We have two steps to qualify: a pre-qualification evaluation and the technical evaluation. However, we had to find a balance, as we cannot make it too stringent but we also need to ensure that we are not too lenient. We select developed as standard criteria, so that when we have a project that we want to float, it is very easy to evaluate the bids. With that we can now qualify more service provide and faster, as the criteria becomes easy to understand. </p><h4>How has Haya Water promoted itself on a corporate level, as well as supporting other businesses?</h4><p>We participate in a lot of events and that is where we network with a variety of stakeholders. We also have a lot of advertising in the papers. We talk with all different entities. In terms of Al Muj Muscat, they are interested in our compost plant. A compost plant gets its feedstock from sludge from different plants, and recently, we started our Seeb STP plant operation, which is producing a lot of sludge. We mix 2:1, two parts sludge, one part green waste, to produce our compost. We are also in discussions with Be'ah and PDO. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you rate Omanis' level of awareness for environmental issues, and what is the Ministry doing to raise awareness in this area?</h4><p>Environmental awareness is the foundation for sound environmental management and protection. One of the Ministry's mandates is to strengthen this among all segments of society through the promotion of positive changes for a better, more protected and sustainable environment. This is possible not only with the right level of awareness, but also with balanced laws and regulations that support sound science, planning, and the encouragement of environmentally-friendly practices. Omanis are generally very attached to nature and their environment, and so have developed unique means to maintain their surroundings. Our task at the Ministry is to apply the right strategies and practices to channel and utilize the natural zeal of Omanis for an enhanced outcome. We work closely with the Ministry of Education, schools, and universities to integrate environmental issues and concepts of protection in their curricula. Additionally, various research centers collaborate with us to carry out the necessary studies and research to achieve our goals. Our activities to raise awareness include cooperation with media, print, TV, radio, and social media avenues. To promote education and dialogue, the Ministry holds workshops and brings students, business executives, and NGOs to talk about the environment and its most pertinent issues, as well as how to solve certain problems. In addition, we join the world in celebrating international occasions and events where our efforts help raise awareness levels.</p><h4>The Ministry also has a mandate to take care of climate affairs. What is being done to protect Oman in the event of natural disasters?</h4><p>Oman has shown foresight by establishing a Ministry that oversees not only environment and nature conservation, but also climate affairs in an integrated fashion. The ministry is responsible for developing and setting policies and laws, enforcing regulations, carrying out research and studies, and coordinating with relevant sectors. Our efforts extend both to the regional and international communities through handling of international negotiations and cooperation on climate change. Currently, the “National Strategy for Adaptation and Mitigation of Climate Change Impacts“ is being prepared in collaboration with Sultan Qaboos University and UNEP. This will complement national efforts to address the adverse impacts of climate change including natural disasters such as hurricanes and tsunamis.  Oman has established several preparedness and response mechanisms including coordination among relevant authorities such as, in addition to the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs: the National Civil Defense Committee, Public Authority for Civil Aviation, the Supreme Council of Planning, the Ministry of Regional Municipalities and Water Resources, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Housing as well as others. Another important development has been the establishment of the National Multi-Hazard Early Warning System in collaboration with IOC-UNESCO. Through these efforts and activities, Oman is well prepared to proactively deal with such disasters. </p><h4>How does the Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs cooperate with other Ministries to ensure that environmental issues are taken care of in other sectors?</h4><p>Environmental protection and conservation hold a central place in Oman's vision and regulations. As a result, environmental issues and dimensions are integrated into sectoral activities in various forms. The ministry cooperates with all other sectors to ensure that the environment, with its social, biological and physical compartments, is embedded in the planning and execution of plans and projects.  In addition, the ministry is represented in various inter-sectoral committees to include environmental issues in strategies and programs.  In a nutshell, cooperation, collaboration and dialogue with other ministries are always implemented in the early stages of planning and form part of our continuous activity. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>By focusing on the management of water, solid waste, and renewable energy in particular, what are the most important projects executed by MECA during 2015?</h4><p>Water resources are our most valuable natural resources. Water is the lifeline of all living creatures and an important resource for various developmental activities. The Ministry of Environment and Climate Affairs (MECA) pays great attention to this resource by protecting it from pollution, optimizing its use, and improving recycling. The ministry inspects all projects emitting industrial or sewage waste and sets forth environmental requirements necessary to control or reduce to the lowest possible levels any impact of such pollutants on the environment. MECA further issues permits for re-use of treated water so as to contribute to the preservation of this vital resource. The management and assessment of water resources is outside of MECA jurisdiction and there are other dedicated agencies with which MECA coordinates that manage this sector. Regarding the management of solid wastes, MECA functions as a regulatory authority, drafting bills and guidelines, issuing regulations, and following the implementation of the same in coordination with other relevant parties. The ministry provides support to projects and companies operating in the field of waste management as well as to industry investors through facilitating the flow of information and necessary technical data. MECA also encourages companies to introduce systems of improving waste management and recycling in keeping with the best global environmental practices.</p><h4>What are the main areas of environmental improvement that need close attention from MECA in 2016?</h4><p>There are multiple areas that will need environmental upgrading and protection. MECA consolidated the efficacy of environmental management via the provision of necessary tools in all phases of project development lifecycles. We are addressing the need for promoting coordination among stakeholders, implementing technologies of environmental monitoring and controlling, and enhancing research to support the decision-making process. In this regard, MECA is developing a long-term strategy and developing a detailed action plan. There is also a national strategy for controlling changes in climatic impacts and how to best cope with them. A report has been made on specified national contributions to mitigate these effects and cope with climatic changes in cooperation with other agencies. MECA is further upgrading strategies of biodiversity, wildlife protection, and fighting desertification as per the best available global practices in nature conversation. Regarding renewable energy, MECA called for investing in this vital sector through many awareness programs in cooperation with all segments of the community, including workshops, environmental forums, and other similar initiatives aimed at encouraging such a culture in consolidation for sustainable development. The Sultanate has already begun investing in these kinds of environmentally friendly and economically sustainable projects. Additionally, there are plans to control the rationed emissions of many companies. Monitoring of such programs is conducted from a control room at MECA and is meant to conform to the global systems approved in the field of environmental preservation.</p><h4>Oman hosted a sustainable tourism workshop in May 2015 under your patronage. What are MECA's plans to support such initiative in the future?</h4><p>Environmental tourism in Oman attracts visitors from inside and outside the Sultanate.  Numbers have increased recently, thanks to the security, beauty, and natural landscape of Oman. MECA will develop an agenda in cooperation with the Ministry of Tourism so as to take full advantage of the available natural reserves and attractions in a way that preserves their functions while sustaining our long-term heritage in a skilled manner. We are working to provide them with necessary services to support their active role in creating socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable development. MECA is cooperating with experienced international and regional agencies in this regard, as well. The ministry is also considering a number of new projects for the private sector in the field of sustainable tourism. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[quick-easy-solutions]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Talabat get its start, and how have you seen the company grow over the years?</h4><p>Established by passionate Kuwaiti young entrepreneurs, Talabat is a mold of a concept that they experienced during their study abroad. Coming back to Kuwait they believed that with the wave of internet domination and need for easy, quick solutions it would be relevant to the fast-paced market. With limited resources, they overcame many odds and brought life to Talabat in 2004. Depending solely on basic online marketing and building a diversity of restaurants profile to cater to the online ordering community, it began gaining visibility. In 2010, Mohammad Jaffar bought the concept where the size of Talabat was at only 700 orders a day, and now Talabat has grown to achieve more than 50,000 orders per day. Talabat is no longer just an online ordering platform, it has become a driver for food purchase decisions whether it's at home or to dine in. People use Talabat to check out menus, restaurant reviews, prices, and menu variety even before they visit a restaurant. I recall one of the best moments I have had is hearing people say to each other “Yala Talabat-it" like “Google it". Seeing the metamorphosis of the brand within the past five years, has left my team and I more determined and focused to cloak each house, each person, and each phone with Talabat orange.</p><h4>What does the $170 million acquisition of Talabat by Rocket Internet signify about the online food delivery market in the Middle East?</h4><p>I think it is worth highlighting that, the Middle East and specifically the GCC, according to a study made by the US Consensus Bureau worldwide that internet penetration in the GCC is almost 85% and smartphone penetration is 80%. Compared to the rest of the world with only 46% internet penetration and in the Middle East at 52%. In terms of customer behavior, GCC citizens like to stay informed, want quick and stress-free solutions that are customizable to their liking combined with the high income per capita, young expanding population, demographical dynamics and increasing demand of food delivery both by customers and businesses makes this market a very ripe one. In Kuwait alone, the restaurant industry revenues exceed $2.4 Billion in the year 2014 of which between 30-40% is generated by home delivery and Talabat dominates 95% market share for online food ordering in Kuwait currently. Market dynamics and industry value coupled with the increased performance of Talabat, led to the valuation, as it factored in the potential prospects and future growth of the business to dominate the entire Middle East. Again the market is a ripe one that Talabat during its peak took advantage of and positioned itself as a pioneer of online food ordering.</p><h4>How does Talabat's story give credence to the potential that is out there for Kuwait's entrepreneurs?</h4><p>Talabat is an inspiring story, especially for passionate young entrepreneurs in the region. We were approached by numerous entrepreneurs in Kuwait curious to learn the secret recipe and we were always glad to stretch the support and provide the guidance. Entrepreneurial development here in Kuwait although receives attention presents plenty of opportunities that are supported by private and government supported initiatives, such as Kuwait National Fund for SME's. We can only hope that Talabat' s story will inspire further drive in the business sector to give more consideration to sponsoring relevant ideas that support entrepreneurs in Kuwait. </p><h4>What advice would you give to entrepreneurs in Kuwait who are looking to grow like Talabat has?</h4><p>Interesting ideas and concepts spur everywhere in Kuwait, but great ideas and concepts need to have commercial and practical feasibility applicable to the market. Thus I would advise entrepreneurs to stay loyal to their idea, determined to see their idea come to life, and reflect on the idea to further develop it into a business plan that makes it feasible for implementation. It requires full time attention to build the model with the support of key elements and key functions. Although it may be vague in the beginning as with Talabat, building a high performing team with key roles is essential to any business.  I cannot reiterate enough how important it is to have a great team and maximize on their expertise. I have always been proud to be part of the team and even more proud that the team that I have worked with always supported each other, which is interpreted now as the Talabat culture. We work together as a family to support each other to drive business performance and growth.</p><h4>What other potential opportunities exist in the e-commerce space in the Gulf region?</h4><p>E-commerce in the GCC is an undiscovered forte with lots of opportunities. Numerous e-commerce projects have become visible and successful in the region, in for example retail and tourism. More effort is needed to raise awareness to the use of online services and the added value they present to companies and customers alike. The potentials for e-commerce in the Gulf is very high and by 2020 this industry is valued at approximately $41.5 billion according to recent studies. E-commerce should be tapped and exploited, through educating the public and supporting retail e-commerce projects, which will present value worth to both the customer and merchants. Talabat is a premier example of this, it only requires a few steps to place an order and removes the hassle of traditional phone ordering.</p><h4>What is the biggest impediment to conducting business that you currently face?</h4><p>As any business the only impediments that we face are external factors that could affect the overall key performance indicators of the business, and managing our decisions effectively around making them to our advantage rather than touch the business. Since any business depends heavily on the human element to succeed, we are always hungry for young experienced talents. There are challenges finding the right talents especially in the e-commerce industry, but the picture looks far more optimistic these days. </p><h4>What are your expectations for Talabat in 2016?</h4><p>Keeping focus on performance, growth and continuously improving on the product and the value proposal offering is at the heart of our vision for 2016. Our objective is to increase our market share and expand to dominate the MENA region in the coming period. Talabat's main competitive advantage lies in its name, which means "orders" in English, giving it versatility for future endeavours and service line expansions and diversifications. With our current holding group, Delivery Hero, we work together closely to reinforce our platforms performance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the way that the drop in oil prices has affected monetary policy in Qatar?</h4><p>QCB continues to pursue its main objective of maintaining the exchange rate peg while ensuring monetary and financial stability. Although the drop in oil prices has induced a fall in export earnings and government revenues and consequently government deposits, banking systemic liquidity has been comfortable so far partly reflecting QCB's active liquidity management operations. Given the large fiscal buffers, the decline in oil revenues has not led to significant spending cuts, rather the government has embarked on a strategy of prioritizing expenditures to improve investment efficiency, while taking initiatives to increase private participation in support of economic diversification. With growth being robust and inflation benign, QCB has continued with the easy monetary policy stance, keeping key policy rates unchanged since August 2011 to ensure a stable interest rate environment and thereby facilitating an adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors to support economic diversification for sustainable growth. At the same time, macroprudential policies have been strengthened further to promote financial stability.</p><h4>How would you rate the success of the recent $4.1 billion bond issuance in September and how will this impact Qatar's financial position?</h4><p>QCB has been actively managing liquidity to ensure monetary and financial stability and thereby to support sustainable growth. The bond issuance in September 2015 is part of that broader strategy of liquidity management. Despite this issuance, the banking system liquidity was in a primary surplus position as reflected in the sum of net Qatar Money Rate (QMR) deposits and excess reserves with QCB at QAR5.4 billion at end-September 2015. Moreover, the banks' liquid asset to liabilities continues to be stable at around 50%, while the quality of banking assets has continued to improve; the gross NPL ratio has declined to its lowest level since 2011. At the same time, reflecting the implementation of Basel III framework since January 2014, banks remained well capitalized (capital adequacy around 15%, significantly above the current regulatory requirement of 12.5%) and profitable (return on average assets at 2%). This suggests the continued robustness of Qatar's financial sector.</p><h4>In your opinion, what newly enacted laws will be the most impactful on the performance of the Qatar Stock Exchange?</h4><p>Under the Strategic Plan for Financial Sector Regulation, importance is also given to the development of the Qatar Stock Exchange. In particular, attention has been given to attract foreign investment. An important achievement in this regard is the issuance of Law No. 9 increasing the foreign ownership limit to 49% for listed Qatari companies. Following the introduction of this Law, the Qatar Stock Exchange recorded high levels in traded volume and index in September 2014. The Strategic Plan also aims to maintain a conducive and investor-friendly environment. The liquidity provision scheme of 2013, together with the new rules on margin trading introduced by the Qatar Financial Markets Authority (QFMA) offer a number of advantages for the market and investors, such as increasing trading volumes and liquidity, and should help to reduce price volatility and promote confidence among investors, thereby ensuring a fair and orderly market. Such positive developments gave rise to upgrades by MSCI and S&amp;P to emerging market status in 2014.</p><h4>Considering that many Qatar-based banks are expanding their operations internationally, how would you assess the strength of the Qatari banking sector and what role do you foresee Qatar-based banks having as a development partner?</h4><p>The expansion of operations of Qatar-based banks internationally is in itself an indication of the increasing strength and confidence of these banks to compete with other banks in the international arena. As a regulator, QCB is ensuring that the expansion should be prudential. Limits have been fixed on the foreign currency gap. The ratio of foreign currency asset to foreign currency liability of each bank should be at a minimum of 100%. This means that short positions are not allowed, but long are allowed. More importantly, QCB has been in the forefront in implementation of Basel III requirements. The capital adequacy is being monitored at both solo and consolidated levels. The strength of the banks is also reflected in their ability to meet Basel III requirements with excess capital buffers and low levels of NPLs despite the persistence of low oil prices. Hence, the ratings of the banks continue to remain high. Qatari banks have been playing an important role in the development of the economy. They have been extending credit to both the hydrocarbon and the non-hydrocarbon sector to meet productive needs. The current high growth in credit to the private sector reflects the support they are providing to the diversification of the economy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We expect the oil price to recover in the year ahead. This recovery along with the continued thrust toward investment and diversification should lead to a healthy growth in the economy as well as the banking sector. On the regulatory policy front, since guidelines for various Basel III requirements have already been issued, the focus would be on their implementation. In the year ahead, banks will have to maintain additional capital to meet the countercyclical capital requirements. Moreover, domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs) have already been instructed for maintenance of additional capital from next year onwards. On the monetary policy front, QCB will continue to actively manage liquidity in the system in order to ensure a stable interest rate environment and thereby facilitate adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy. If low oil prices persist for long, policy space available in terms of both fiscal buffers and QCB's liquidity management operations could be used flexibly.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on NGC's role in the Omani market, and how you are positioning yourself in the gas sector?</h4><p>We have been here for more than three decades, and NGC has traditionally operated as a company catering only to the Omani market. Over the last seven or eight years we have branched out into other geographies like the UAE and Saudi Arabia. We also acquired Shell's LPG business in Malaysia in 2012. Oman, being the home country, has always been the focus. However, we have established a strong presence on the international stage in order to emerge out of local market challenges. We are trying to increase our revenues in Oman by pushing for more quantity from the Ministry of Oil &amp; Gas. Our efforts with the Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry have been focused on price increases, which have not been reviewed for a long time. We have been consistently compliant with Omanization requirements and are committed to developing local talent by training and hiring as many Omanis as possible. While prices remain a factor, we are making all efforts to increase revenues not only from the existing product lines but looking at alternative streams by innovation and engineering.</p><h4>How does NGC envision growth and expansion into new sectors?</h4><p>In terms of gas, we need to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. We have been an LPG player all these years, so moving into a different segment will require a different set of licenses and regulatory approvals. It will require capital investments as well. These are the factors to consider and challenges that can be overcome; it is just a matter of time.</p><h4>What are the major changes or transformations anticipated within the sector, specifically in regards to gas prices?</h4><p>With international hydrocarbons prices remaining low, the country's overall revenues are on the decline. So far the domestic prices for in-country consumption are protected but the government bears the strain. In the longer term this leads to high deficits, prompting international borrowings, which comes at a cost. The reduction in subsidies is one way of reducing government deficit and this may be easier than ever to implement in the current situation, where international prices have come down so significantly. However, subsidies have always been a sensitive subject for governments the world over and have been easier to reduce in theory rather than in practice. There are always long-term effects, and the public reaction is hard to predict, especially considering gas is a social utility product being consumed on mass.</p><h4>What are the key challenges impacting your business and the sector?</h4><p>One challenge is that our LPG cylinders all look exactly the same. In other countries, bottling companies have their own branded bottles, which are easily recognizable; they may be painted red, orange, or yellow, for example. In Oman this rule has not been applied—all cylinders are silver colored—and we fill any cylinder that comes in as long as it is not an expired cylinder. This is a problem for us because if a cylinder comes in that is not ours and is expired, we are still required to replace it. The smaller players push expired cylinders back into distribution, and they eventually end up back in our channel for filling because they are difficult to identify. Unsafe cylinders circulating in the market can be a big safety hazard to citizens. We have been pushing for branding of cylinders for a long time. Branding of cylinders will go a long way to making the companies responsible for their products. We maintain the highest safety standards and we are ISO certified so safety is all the more important considering the flammable nature of the gas that we deal in.</p><h4>What are NGC's expectations for this year, and your outlook on the sector for the next few years?</h4><p>Luckily, we are in an industry where there is consistent demand. LPG is used daily in both households and industries. We expect 2015 to be a good year from a demand perspective. Medium to long term, we anticipate growth in the company. We have plans to expand into different countries and to diversify into different alternative fuels; the future looks bright.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You have identified yourself as the only existing local player in the Omani market. Can you describe your business segment?</h4><p><span></span><strong>Qais Mehmood Al Khonji</strong> This is a specialized niche market related to reservoirs and oil. Time, accuracy, and money are the most important elements to starting a business, and international players face a huge time gap. In the case someone requests samples from an international company, results can only be acquired after collections are taken and sent abroad, which can sometimes take up to seven months. In that time, needs can change. It is a dynamic time for the segment. We are dealing with a reservoir that can be optimized through research. The formation is continually changing, and many things are happening. We are continuing what we have established, and we are competing with the internationals. </p><p><span></span><strong>Ajay s. Upadhye </strong>Multinational companies are doing the same work we are doing, though we have the advantage because we are a local Omani company with maximum routine and extraordinary (SCAL) lab services.  Multinational Companies have to send the samples to outside Oman or the region at some point.</p><h4>At this point, what are your biggest challenges moving forward?</h4><p>AsU Our biggest challenge is recruitment. The company is two years old, and we are still in the setup phase, moving forward accordingly. When it comes to manpower, it takes a lot of time to get clearances. Attracting skilled labor has definitely been a challenge. Finance could be a problem to an extent. Banks have not been as keen to facilitate startups because oil prices have been dropping, which is another issue. We are in discussions with the banks, and hopefully things are moving forward.</p><h4>What adaptations have Genesis adopted to participate in the current market? </h4><p><strong>QMAK</strong> As a very young company, it has been a major challenge to move in this market due to attitudes. If you are Weatherford, people automatically trust you. It is more difficult to build a local presence from scratch. As people realize what we are doing, we are advancing and developing relationships with people. We are seeing developments lately as we answer people's queries with proposals. </p><p><strong>AsU</strong> It is about building trust and gaining the confidence of local market. We have offered free tests, so our results can be tested and we can build a client base. Though we have reached that stage, we are still going through a continuous process.</p><h4>What will it take for mentalities to change, and how are you sustaining your business in the meantime?</h4><p><span></span><strong>QMAK</strong> This is the opportunity for people and the government to call on operators to think about how to restructure the price strategy as oil prices are declining. <strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong><strong>AsU</strong> It will take time to establish a client base in Oman, and we are sustaining ourselves with jobs from outside. Our first job is from Dubai. Our second job is expected to come from Abu Dhabi. We have a small job expected locally, and there are openings in both the Saudi market and in the Malaysian market. We are building our CV with outside projects at the moment.</p><p><span></span><strong>QMAK</strong> In the case of the services, we approach the customer and give them a guarantee. If they are unsatisfied with the services, they will not pay. We are confident in what we are doing, and our work is important. We are conducting crucial and critical analyses that allow us to suggest to the customer what chemical injections would maximize the resources of their reservoir. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is STS's role in the energy sector in Oman? </h4><p>STS provides services in three key areas: construction, fabrication, and maintenance. We primarily serve the upstream oil sector with companies such as PDO, BP, and Oxy. We also work in the downstream sector, primarily in refining and aluminum smelting. STS is an Oman-based regional contracting company. We have operations through our subsidiaries and joint ventures currently working in Algeria, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. In Oman our largest client is PDO. We are four years into a seven-year service contract for PDO, providing maintenance, construction, and engineering services to PDO's north Oman directorate. Through this particular contract, which employs around 5,000 people daily in the oil field, we have been able to achieve a number of goals in the ICV area, most importantly in the development of SMEs and LCCs. We work and partner with these companies on a day-to-day basis to assist them in developing their skills. The other key area of ICV has been developing Omani talent in areas of engineering and technical trades.</p><h4>STS was awarded with an outstanding performance award from Oman Methanol Company. What have been the company's biggest achievements over the past two years?</h4><p>There are two methanol plants in Oman, including Oman Methanol Company located in Sohar. In the last two years, we have executed both of their shutdowns, on time or early, within budget, and without HSE issues. The downstream sector is an expanding market, and the maintenance and upkeep of these facilities is becoming a growing area of our business.</p><h4>What needs to be done in terms of forwarding Omanization and in-country value (ICV)?</h4><p>There are two areas that need focus. All companies must genuinely take Omanization and ICV initiatives into account before awarding work. The emphasis should be on ICV instead of just price. This is one major step that the government can take. Some GCC countries have government training programs to develop people for the different sectors. Thus, in those places the government has more overall control as to the quality of the people in the labor market. Oman can focus on this area to improve Omanization.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans for the future?</h4><p>We are currently working on a five-year strategic plan. In 2003, STS employed 600 people, and today we have just under 7,500. We are continuing to grow. In terms of future expansion, we will continue our opportunity-focused approach, in and out of the GCC. We will identify opportunities regionally and look for partners that can help us execute our plans, as we have done in Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE. At the moment, we are looking at specific opportunities outside of Oman in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.</p><h4>How do you enforce environmental care?</h4><p>We are ISO 14001 and OHSAS 18001 compliant. We have a certification and a management system in place and have so far been accredited in those key areas. We are also proud to be annual supporters of the Oman Environmental Society. There are also many potential business synergies with clean energy. GlassPoint can effectively produce steam without consuming any fossil fuels, which is a tremendous technology. PDO has a number of others on the way, and there is a wind energy project in southern Oman. There are many business opportunities for companies that wish to align themselves with green technology in the future, both in Oman and in the region. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most recent developments taking place at Al-Maha Petroleum?</h4><p>Al-Maha is a leading distributer of petroleum products for the retail and commercial sector in Oman, with close to 190 gas stations spread across the Sultanate. We have strong commercial business ties with different companies in both the private and government sectors, including a strategic partnership with Chevron. With regard to the aviation sector, we are also in association with various airlines. In terms of development, we are focusing on widening our retail networks and achieving customer satisfaction. We are also working to implement quality services within a shorter time frame. We used to have contracts with companies that provided us with trucks to deliver the goods to the Rural Areas Electricity Company (RAECO) stations. Now, Al-Maha has purchased new trucks and so we have more control over the delivery time and efficiency. </p><h4>Al-Maha has many partnerships such as Rural Areas Electricity in the Dhofar Governorate and Oman Air with the new airports. How does the company envision the expansion of these partnerships?</h4><p>Oman is investing more in projects in the electricity sector to an anticipated annual increase in power consumption due to an industrial and construction boom. REACO is undertaking electricity generation transmission distribution and supply activities in Oman. There are over 30 power stations in Oman and Al-Maha supplies fuel to all these areas under a contract. One of the challenges we face is fuel transportation to rural areas because the refineries are located in the North part of Oman, while the power stations are in the Southern part. An increase in the growth of development has allowed Al-Maha to cater to the high demand. Oman Air, which operates scheduled domestic and international passenger services as well as regional air taxi and charter flights, is Al-Maha's most important and strategic partner. The aviation Industry in Oman has been steadily increasing its passenger numbers both for transit and for tourists who visit the country. 50% of Oman Air's need is catered by Al-Maha. Further expansion of Muscat Airport, Salalah, will ultimately boost Al-Maha's aviation business. </p><h4>The company has two new innovations: one is E-rial and the other is Smart Fuel. How are these innovations adding value to Al-Maha?</h4><p>Al-Maha was one of the first oil companies in the area to use filling fuel through smart cards, which were inaugurated in 2001. We have a considerable number of consumers who are using these cards and it has gained popularity within a short span of time. The E-rial and smart cards were a promotional concept of Al-Maha's creative team. E-rial is a prepaid card that is usually used by individual customers, and Smart cards are for the companies and we have both government and private companies who avail these facilities. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the company for 2015 and your long-term outlook for the development of Oman?</h4><p>To maintain our leadership in the market, we have to face more challenges and explore new ideas and technologies. There are opportunities for the company to expand into related business outside Oman. Our aim is to enter international markets to acquire key. The future is promising for Al-Maha, we expect to become the market leader with a 40% share. We are extending our services to the remote part of the Sultanate where fuel supply is limited. As a result, we are widening their economic growth. We support tourism by building service stations at key tourist locations across the Sultanate. Through participation in energy and energy-related projects we play an important role in developing Oman's economy. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies has Gulf Energy employed to be more competitive especially outside of Oman?</h4><p>Gulf Energy built its strategies through internal commitments as basis, while structuring customer-based frameworks to meet each client's requirement individually. Alongside Gulf Energy's continuous work to adopt all compulsory international QHSE standards, we employ international industry standards as well as codes of practice that retain high levels of competitiveness within local and international companies. Performance enhancement has been employed to promote workforce skills quality by established comprehensive in-house standards and developed skillful capabilities in terms of competency trainings for the employees. We are focusing on maintaining performance track-records analysis and improving enriched experiences to the next challenging level, consequently enabling the organization to efficiently execute bids of Oil &amp; Gas outside of Oman. Although Gulf energy has a multinational professional blend of experts, 90% of Gulf Energy's top-level management are Omani with international experience in leading oil and gas companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton. We have dynamically embraced the sophisticated know-how and produced formulated capabilities and a competent environment. Being an Omani company with Omani leaders is a prestigious advantage for In Country Value (ICV) in the local market, especially within the few GCC companies that are working outside their original countries. We have a training department and our in-house QHSE training has been developed to allow us to work outside of Oman. We have a variety of nationalities with different experience across the board that work with us and give us guidance on QHSE training and the technical parts to allow us to move ahead and compete outside.</p><h4>How have you managed to grow despite low oil prices?</h4><p>Being a local company, our overhead is not that high compared to international companies. International companies need to pay a huge cost for their headquarters. The low oil price and adverse economical condition has been sustained by the advantage of recruiting local Omanis. We have adopted the same policy of localizing the recruitments and employment in the countries we operate in around the world. That gave us an advantage and added-value to overcome global economical crises and low oil prices. </p><h4>What are your major targets for the coming years?</h4><p>In terms of bringing in new business, we target expansion both locally and internationally by bringing new technology, in terms of drilling, enhanced oil recovery, and steam applications. Gulf Energy had a few joint ventures with technology owners to open a few facilities that will enable us to produce local branded products that can be labelled “made in Oman." In chemicals, we have a joint venture through which we are developing a factory in Sohar. There are a few things that are in the pipeline that will be executed within 18 months from now. Gulf Energy's growth has been the evidence for successful challenges and wise strategies. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current positioning of Daleel Oil in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>Daleel Petroleum LLC is one of the key contributors to Oman's economy. It was established in 2002, as a JV in terms of 50/50 shared by CNPC (China National Petroleum Corporation) and MB Holding, an Omani company. Over the past 12 years, companying with the development of the Sultanate of Oman, Daleel's daily rate has increased from 4,500 bpd to the current level of above 45,000 bpd. Despite the fact that we are limited by a smaller concession, only around 1,000 square km, we are keeping the position as the third oil producer in Oman, after PDO and Oxy. </p><h4>How would you summarize Daleel's performance over the past year?</h4><p>It was a challenging but profitable year for Daleel. In this year, a new 3D seismic acquisition was completed, which covered both shallow and deep formation with wide azimuth and high-density coverage. 65 wells were drilled with rigs, and more than 200 jobs were completed with CTUs, and about 180 jobs were accomplished with hoists. Our production daily has been made a very good showing by reaching a level of 44,000 bpd on average. </p><h4>How are low oil prices affecting your business, and what strategies are you employing to adapt? </h4><p>The oil prices have already impacted our operations as well as other operators, and we have already trimmed down our work program and budget for this year. We expect it not to change significantly until the end of the year. When we saw a trend in the decline of oil prices, we took early actions in January, and our strategy now is to focus more on optimization of the projects and the daily operations. Some projects will be delayed to fit within the budget, but overall, which will not have too much impact on operations. At the same time, we are working together with our contractors to close gaps and reduce costs by optimizing the value chain. Exploration-wise we have not changed our strategy; we will continue with that program because it will lead to future growth. At Daleel, we are taking this opportunity to promote the operational efficiency. </p><h4>How is the sector transforming, and what changes will be essential for the evolution of the industry in Oman?</h4><p>The sector contributes to about 80% of GDP. At the moment it is a little less, but it still remains the main contributor to Oman's economy. In the coming years this situation is unlikely to change. Therefore more capital is needed in terms of investment to strengthen the sector, but at the same time, the government has a vision for diversification of the economy through tourism, SMEs, and so forth. This will be a gradual process, and that instead of cost cutting, the government needs an increase in contributions from other sectors in order to reduce the percentage of the oil and gas on GDP. In general, the diversification is a good strategy for Oman but needs to identify how to diversify. The oil and gas sector could still need more investment because of the enhancement of current sector as well as the exploration of many untapped reserves. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the major expansion projects that have been undertaken by Orpic in the past 12 months, and how will they contribute to current and future operations?</h4><p>To achieve Orpic's vision of building an Omani integrated refining and petrochemical business that we are proud of, we must support opportunities to grow our people, grow our business, and grow our capacity to meet the needs of Oman and the international markets. Our strategic growth projects are in line with our plans to add value to the oil and gas molecules produced in Oman, operate to high HSE standards, and focus on a higher standard of efficiency, lower costs, and serving the Sultanate with pride. The company's current growth projects, including Sohar Refinery Improvement Project, Muscat Sohar Product Pipeline, and the Liwa Plastics Industries Complex are not only expected to generate significant financial returns to our shareholders but will further diversify Orpic's product mix and intensify its downstream business operations.</p><h4>What challenges have been faced in the market over the past year, and how will Orpic look to mitigate these concerns?</h4><p>Like any industry, challenges and changing market conditions have the ability to impact all businesses small and large, including impacts on margins and pressure on costs. However Orpic, as the sole supplier of the nation's fuel, has an ongoing commitment to operate the refinery to meet market needs, regardless of any challenges or industry changes. To minimize the effect of changing market conditions, Orpic has implemented a number of short- and long-term initiatives to improve performance and financial results, which is already yielding positive outcomes.</p><h4>The natural gas market in Oman has a lot of potential. How can Orpic contribute to the development of this segment? </h4><p>Currently, one of the major usages of Oman's natural gas is to produce energy. To obtain maximum benefits from this natural resource, Orpic is delivering a major strategic growth project known as the Liwa Plastics Industries Complex (LPIC). In addition to burning lean gas for energy, LPIC will extract C2+ molecules from natural gas and use it to produce polyolefins, which will increase the value gained from natural gas. The LPIC project will enable downstream investment, such as the plastic conversion industry, and further enhance the socio-economic impact of Orpic across the Sultanate. Through future business relations with major plastic converters in the industry, involving both large businesses and SMEs, LPIC has the potential to be a facilitator of the establishment and growth of a plastic manufacturing industry in Oman.</p><h4>Polyethylene is to be produced in Oman for the first time. How important is this both for Orpic and the petrochemical sector?</h4><p>Upon the commissioning of the LPIC project, Oman will be a producer of polyethylene, along with extra quantity of polypropylene. This is a significant strategy for Orpic and the petrochemical sector in Oman, as this will allow Orpic to increase its range of polymer products, and tap new markets both in Oman and abroad. With a forecast to produce around one million tons of polymers annually, Orpic will be in a strong position to compete in the international polymer market, and at the same time improve value optimization within Oman, by converting the natural gas to plastics.</p><h4>How does Orpic currently manage its relationship with banks, both in Oman and the GCC?</h4><p>Orpic has longstanding positive relations with both local and GCC banks, and we view this as a vital element to Orpic's continued growth. Our institutional stakeholders have demonstrated a strong level of commitment and support to Orpic, both at an operational level as well as at a project level, making us a preferred partner. In May this year, Orpic successfully achieved an $908.86 million corporate loan through a syndicated facility. This was the first corporate debt raising activity undertaken by Orpic, which was met with overwhelming confidence and support from local banks. This is a powerful indication of Orpic's financial strength and the certainty we have been able to generate in the market as a credit-worthy entity. We intend to further strengthen our relationship with banking institutions with the upcoming financing of LPIC project, which will give local and GCC banks an opportunity to be part of this integral development.</p><h4>There has been talk regarding privatizing certain areas of Orpic's business. What impact will this have on current operations?</h4><p>We view our shareholder's consideration to part privatize Orpic sometime in the future as a natural progression to their investment management. Orpic is an independent entity that runs on a commercial basis and has a governance structure that supports this. Any such action by our shareholders will further embolden Orpic's commercial standing. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Looking back over the past year, what have been some of the major successes for PDO, and how would you assess the impact of the low oil prices on the company?</h4><p>Despite a challenging year, in which falling oil prices played an increasingly significant role, PDO was able to deliver impressive achievements across our operations. The average daily oil production for 2014 was 570,534 bpd—well above the long-term plateau target of 550,000 bpd. It was our highest oil production since 2006. The combined average production—oil, gas, and condensate—was also the third highest in our history at 1.231 million barrels of oil equivalent per day. Additionally, there was a significant 8% increase in stock tank oil initially in place from 61.9 billion barrels to 66.6 billion, thanks to outstanding exploration and reservoir management work. We created 4,300 job and training opportunities for Omanis with our contractors and awarded contracts worth $4.9 billion to local companies. </p><h4>What are your views on OPEC's decision not to cut output, and how will it affect PDO and the Omani hydrocarbons sector?</h4><p>We are determined to stay the course given the robustness and economic viability of our programs. That means pursuing projects that will generate real and lasting value for Oman and our shareholders, while identifying those areas of the business where we can do things more efficiently. Through a collaborative approach with contractors and several contract optimization reviews, we have been able to identify just under $500 million of savings over the Business Plan Period (2015-19) on total contract values of around $2.4 billion with further opportunities being pursued, and with our increasingly pervasive Lean value chain realization and waste reduction model. We have also launched an Every Rial Counts campaign raising awareness for staff regarding cost control.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the private sector in the oil and gas sector?</h4><p>In December 2013, a blueprint for the Omani oil and gas sector was unveiled which identified 53 real business opportunities for private firms and which aims at raising the local contribution from 18% to 32% by 2020. Local SMEs need to be able to execute work safely, professionally, and at commercially competitive rates, which is why we have signed an MoU with PASMED aimed at strengthening cooperation and collaboration on training, business advice, and knowledge exchange. There are some fantastic opportunities for SMEs to get involved in the oil and gas industry. We have already seen great strides in our Local Community Contractor (LCC) initiative, which we launched in 1998. This has given people living in our concession area the chance to establish their own SMEs to provide us with services and bid for supply contracts. We have reserved an LCC scope in main contracts and offered guidance and support and there are now more than 200 LCCs active in areas such as maintenance, logistics, electronics, civil engineering, manpower supply, and well services, with more than 3,000 Omanis working for them. </p><h4>Looking ahead for the coming year, what are the major plans and targets for PDO?</h4><p>We will continue to pursue a growth drive with momentum building to a production plateau of 600,000 bpd by 2019, while ensuring we discover new hydrocarbon reserves that match or exceed our production levels. We will aim, with our contractors, to create 7,000 job and training opportunities for Omanis by the end of the year, meaning we will have generated more than 20,000 since 2011. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the most important developments that have taken place under the Ministry of Oil &amp; Gas in the past year?</h4><p>We have recently added 393 million barrels of oil and condensate of reserves, which brings the total expected reserves to 5,306 million barrels. On the gas side, we have added 1.9tcf, and the total of expected gas reserves is 24.3tcf. Production-wise, we produced an average of 943,000 barrels per day last year. If the numbers are converted to annual figures, there was a positive delta on both sides. The upstream and downstream operating companies in total have added an additional 1,600 Omani jobs, making the total Omani jobs almost 12,000 positions against a total of 15,000; Omanization is at about 79%. We have also signed an agreement with Medco Arabia, the Indonesian company, and Intaj, a local company, to initiate a six-year exploration program of Block 56. </p><h4>What is the emphasis for the MOG this year?</h4><p>We are continuing to target 980,000 barrels of production. In March we had reached close to 970,000.  This year will present a challenge because we are adding 40,000 barrels from last year. It goes without saying that we are aiming to meet the national requirement in terms of gas demand, and we will continue to produce 110 million cubic meters of gas, plus imports, which cannot exceed 5.8 million cm. We are looking ahead in terms of what we can supply because demand is increasing every year. Production levels are higher so we will need to use more reserves. Nevertheless, we will aim to replace whatever we consume during the year. </p><h4>How are the Khazzan and the Iranian projects progressing?</h4><p>Khazzan is operating six rigs, and there is a lot of activity on the facilities side. All indications say that gas will be ready for delivery by early 2018. From what we have seen thus far, the project will be able to deliver 1bcf as expected. The Oman-Iran gas project is moving in the right direction, and we are now in ongoing discussions regarding the route that the pipeline will take. After we survey the 200km offshore stretch from Oman to Iran and the 200km onshore on the Iranian side, we can begin talks about financing. </p><h4>What are the Minstry of Oil and Gas's priorities for 2015 and future expectations?</h4><p>Our main priority for 2015 is to ensure that we maintain production for the country at, or above, the national objective of 950,000 barrels/day. We are also aiming to keep the reserve replacement ratio at or above one. We will also focus on maintaining Omanization at the correct level and increasing development and training in order to advance Omanis to senior positions. We need to continue marketing the open blocks to maximize the exploration efforts and results. We have 14 open blocks onshore and offshore, and we will continue to market these. We plan to do more in terms of data acquisition and applying that data to improve our marketing strategies. This will give us a better advantage and put us in a slightly stronger position to demand more for the blocks we have worked on. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does FIC play, and how has the company positioned itself in the Omani market?</h4><p>There are over 20 companies in the Omani market, and FIC is relatively new. We entered Oman in 2005. Our current market share is around 4%, which is at the lower end of the middle seven or eight companies. In the last two to three years, we have been looking at moving into the top tier of companies. The government has issued a ruling concerning the raising of capital, and all insurance companies are now required to go public. </p><h4>Considering the current economic situation, what can drive growth in the insurance sector, and what customer segment is available for insurance companies?</h4><p>The market premium has grown substantially in the last few years in both motor and medical insurance, so this is where the bulk of growth is happening.  Most growth is in the medical insurance segment, and we will continue to see growth in that area because medical insurance may soon be made mandatory for expatriates as well. On the other hand, an oversupply of insurance companies is bringing prices down, making it more difficult to make a profit on medical insurance. </p><h4>Do you see a need to adjust the regulatory framework as the medical insurance sector expands?</h4><p>Companies are allowed to self-regulate and reach a similar level of premium when underwriting. In the overall sector, regulators introduced new rules to encourage more consolidation in the insurance market. Mergers have not really happened in the insurance sector, although there have been some consolidations in the banking sector. </p><h4>What are the adaptations you are making, and what effects are they having on your business and the sector?</h4><p>One area where there is a lot of potential for growth, and where we want to expand into, is that of individual life insurance. It is still low, with the majority of insurance in the life segment being loan-based credit life. In the medium- to long-term, we expect to see a slow increase in the personal lines of life insurance. </p><h4>How would you assess the overall state of the insurance sector in Oman?</h4><p>The sector is still a bit delicate, because most of companies are still dependent on investment returns for final profits. In 2013 there were impressive investment results for all companies, which led to the highly competitive insurance segment we have now in Oman. Investment results were not nearly so positive in 2014. This market needs to understand this situation and make the necessary adjustments. We have a population of four million and $1 billion premium divided between 22 insurance companies. Oman is oversaturated.</p><h4>In such a crowded market, how do you differentiate yourself from the other players?</h4><p>We work on developing relationships with our clients. We are on the customer's side, and we want to be there for them at all times. This is reflected in the fact that many of our clients have been with us for many years. If any of our clients suffers a loss, we want to be with them and ensure that they are up and running as soon as possible.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year for FIC?</h4><p>My main objective for this year is to expand our reach. We will of course have challenges in terms of manpower costs, various factors adversely affecting the overall sector and economy, and also the competitiveness and crowdedness of the sector. In the past four years, we have concentrated mainly on corporate and various commercial insurances. We are recruiting more quality people in line with our geographical expansion this year, and we want to concentrate more on retail insurance. We are looking at 15-20% growth.</p><h4>What are some of the specific needs and demands in the retail and corporate sectors?</h4><p>The insuring public has one demand from insurance companies: lower premiums. Price drives the majority of insurance decisions. Even if FIC was to settle a major claim, the client may choose to take a policy with a company offering slightly lower premiums. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fully Converted]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fully-converted]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Madina's transition to a takaful operation progressed since the January 2014 conversion?</h4><p>We have been able to convert 100% of our policy contracts from conventional to takaful on January 1st, 2014, putting to rest the fears that there could be resistance to such conversion and would result into potential loss of business. We also measure success by the fact that we received a fully compliant sharia certification at the end of 2014. This is in our opinion is an achievement as there were lot of complexities in the conversion process due to the size of our conventional book and absence of takaful law and regulations. We also had to convert to new accounting regulations from IFRS to AAOIFI, which had its own challenges. </p><h4>How would you assess the health of the insurance sector in Oman in relation to the performance of Muscat Securities and the drop in oil prices?</h4><p>The Oman insurance industry should take a serious look at how insurance business is being conducted, otherwise it will not be able to fulfill its role of being a positive contributor to the national economy notwithstanding the fact that the industry has achieved double-digit year on year growth rate in last five years. If you look at insurance as part of the GCC and the amount of income that is retained in the country, it is small. If I consider insurance as an industry that is supposed to contribute to the growth of the economy, I have some concerns. One of the reasons is not having regulations developed in line with the economy's progress, and the changing environment of the country. It is partly due to the complacent attitude of insurance companies—particularly local companies. When you look at the insurance premium in Oman, almost 65-70% of the premiums come from motor and medical. When you look at property and engineering premiums, most of it is reinsured, so it goes out of the country. It is the motor and medical that stays in the country. Motor insurance has a claims ratio of 80-90% and medical is another 85-90%. After providing for management expenses and return on capital there is very little money available, if at all, for investing into training and development. There is income generated by way of reinsurance commission and fronting fees for large property and engineering policies which with investment income provides return to the shareholders on their capital. This model is unsustainable in the long run for the insurance companies as we have seen reinsurance commission being reduced over period of time.</p><h4>What are your company's expectations for the coming year and next five years?</h4><p>We have been growing in the last three or four years at a rate of 15-20%, and we think there are enough opportunities in the market to maintain this rate of growth. Our main focus is on underwriting profitability and this becomes even more significant in takaful as shareholders operate as agents for Policy Holders' Funds so there is a fiduciary obligation to ensure that the fund is managed in a proper manner.  We have a long-term strategy for entering into Life or Family Takaful business. We have a strategic partnership with FWU to introduce unit linked family takaful plans. Expansion is a key driver of the company—we have a strategic stake in Abu Dhabi. This is done to diversify and find avenues of growth. We are open to organic and inorganic growth. In time we would like to create a takaful holding structure that can expand regionally operating out of a common platform that will give us a competitive advantage. This translates into profits for both shareholders and policyholders. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has MSM performed over the past year?</h4><p>In 1H2014, we saw some growth in the index and trading volumes, but the sharp decline in oil prices later in the last year affected the index and liquidity of the market. In the end of 2014 we had a 7% decline against 8% growth at 1H2014. It was a mixed year from start to end, but this is normal given Oman's dependence on oil revenues. Many of our projects are also financed by the Treasury; if income is not supporting expenditure, then perceptions change. This is despite the fact that the government has announced on many occasions that major projects will continue as planned. Though oil prices have an impact on our market psychologically, the drop has not had much effect on the performance of the economy because the expenditure is not affected by declines in oil prices. </p><h4>Last year, you assessed IPOs as one of the main challenges for the Omani market.  How do you see the incentives increasing for IPOs, and have you seen any evolution in the past year?</h4><p>This is always our focus. Although the MSM was weak during the years following the 1998 MSM financial crisis, our daily volumes were considered higher than three GCC exchanges combined i.e., Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar. What that indicates is that IPOs in those exchanges made volumes grow and that liquidity reflects the size of the market. Unfortunately in our case, the IPOs don't meet expectations, which is why our market is not classified as an emerging market, like the UAE and Qatar. This is not due to the regulations or the systems that we are using, but because the size of our market is connected to the lack of the IPOs and liquidity. IPOs are also critical for encouraging new entrepreneurs to enter into the market and giving the confidence to invest. Entrepreneurs and investors want a liquid market, and we are hoping that the government realizes how imperative this is. </p><h4>Can you expand on the effect the return of His Majesty has had on the MSM?</h4><p>We are thankful for the health of His Majesty, and his presence in the country creates a peace of mind not only for locals, but also foreigners. We have always been proud of the stability of Oman. It is a nation without fighting factions, and we are all proud to be Omani. Besides having peace, the economy is also performing better. All the companies that have announced profits for 4Q2014 found that profits exceeded expectations from previous years. It is expected that 1Q2015 will be even better than the close of last year, which is why we have seen continued improvement in the index. There are many issues of concern in the region, but overall Oman is a haven among other countries. We are hoping to attract more investment by the growth of the listed companies. </p><h4>What are the major potential growth areas in the market?  </h4><p>We hope the government will sell assets to increase revenues and that more IPOs will develop from government-owned companies. We are also hoping to see more development bonds and an increase in the sukuk. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year and your long-term outlook on the market?</h4><p>We are confident that peace will prevail in the region, and that we will be able to look towards the future with confidence, as opposed to the same concerns of the past. Oil prices have had an impact on many things, but as we have heard from government officials, major projects will not be affected. An advantage now is that we have comprehensive infrastructure that give the country the boost to move forward and make us better able to attract investments. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[one-step-at-a-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the latest developments taking place in the CMA?</h4><p>It is essential as a regulatory authority to continually review existing rules and regulations. Our intention is to protect investors in the capital market and policyholders, with regards to the insurance sector. We are members of IOSCO and IAIAS, the global regulatory bodies for capital markets and insurance respectively, and operate in compliance with their principles and requirements. We work hard to make sure players in both markets comply with the rules, regulations, and international best practices that we have adopted. We have been working to amend the capital market law, to facilitate investigation of any wrongdoing in the capital markets. We have also been working on the takaful law, now in its final stage, which will ensure it is compliant with necessary requirements. In regard to SMEs, we are working to find a platform for these companies to assist them not only in raising funds for operations, but also to give them supervisory assurance and other support, thereby increasing their credibility, and ease of doing business with potential clients and third parties. We hope to integrate SMEs into the Muscat Securities Market, not merely as special or separate exchanges, and to create more activity. We have also been working to enhance and develop our corporate governance code, even though we were the first country in the Middle East to introduce a corporate governance code in 2002. </p><h4>Is there a mechanism in place to facilitate cooperation among GCC markets? What would better integrate regional markets?</h4><p>The Supreme Council of the GCC has resolved to integrate the GCC market. A committee has been formed consisting of the presidents and CEOs of the capital regulators in the GCC, and we meet regularly to discuss the issues. We have been trying to unify and bring rules and regulations closer to each other in order to ease integration and collaboration. It is challenging, but working nonetheless, and we are moving slowly but steadily towards integration. We also need unified or similar regulations. Second, when it comes to operations, it is important to have proper infrastructure for these exchanges to integrate. Also, we need a central clearing house in the GCC. This will take some time, but progress is being made. </p><h4>Looking internally, what is the mechanism in place for utilizing capital markets in funding economic projects in Oman?</h4><p>This is a vital issue, and indeed, one of the roles of the capital markets is to finance large economic projects. These kinds of projects are needed in Oman in order to grow and diversify the economy, to move away from a dependence on oil and gas, and to create jobs for Omanis. The main instrument to finance such projects is the capital market. Funding from investors can be channeled through the capital market in order to finance these projects. This is the central role of the capital market, and is a key part of our strategy for the coming years—to focus intently on activating and enabling the capital market to play its natural role in the national economy. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the CMA for the coming year?</h4><p>My expectation for the capital market and insurance sectors is for the capital market to assume a fuller role in the economy. In terms of the total capitalization of the market we are talking about 30% of GDP. There is still considerable room for us to grow, although we will need to further activate the capital market in order to better serve the national economy. In the insurance sector, a major component is motor insurance, which is mandatory. We need to make people more aware of the importance of life insurance and how the savings are to their benefit. Having more people using and benefitting from insurance products will also add to the pool of insurance funds, and the capital will help finance a good portion of the economy. Overall, we are working to make sure the capital and insurance market is credible, liquid, stable, and thus attractive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has AIG promoted the optimal use of ICT since its creation in 2009?</h4><p>AIG uses a three-pronged approach. We have increased connectivity for the population through 1,156 Wi-Fi hotspots. This has allowed citizens, especially in the rural areas, to connect to government services, education, and small business. We are expanding that program and increasing coverage by at least 30% in its new version. This is one of our leading projects for 2016, and we will soon have a tender to establish a multi-operator network that will increase coverage and bandwidth for more applications in education, small business, government services, agriculture, and logistics. The network was used primarily with laptops, and now about 80% of the network is being accessed through mobile devices, so we also have a parallel plan to develop more mobile applications for government services. Each agency within government will develop its own applications with AIG's support. We recently launched Panama Apps, a mobile app that catalogues all of the official apps into a single trustworthy source for installing government apps. This is a first of its kind in the region and perhaps even in the world. Government-shared services through ICT-based platforms is our second pillar. We are redesigning our private cloud infrastructure and we are already launching new e-government processes that will contribute to Panama's competitiveness by simplifying and reducing the time involved for government transactions. The third pillar of our approach is citizen participation and government innovation. We have improved through the 2014-19 Digital Agenda the alignment of all government agencies, including AIG. The Digital Agenda—PANAMA 4.0—is the planning tool that allows us to identify IT investments and horizontal needs for multiple agencies for AIG to focus on developing shared platforms and assisting in effective procurement. We will be embarking, starting in 2016, on a more disciplined approach to digital agendas as an instrument for modernizing government, and we are going to do this on a high level. We are looking for top-notch global consultancy companies to help us in this regard.</p><h4>How advanced is Panama in the implementation of e-government compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>Panama ranks amongst the leading countries, which also includes Uruguay, Chile, Mexico, and Colombia. Panama also participates in the ministerial meetings held every two years by the Latin American and Caribbean Network for e-Government (Red GEALC), where best practices are shared and proposals are considered for regional alignment. Chile will host the fourth such ministerial meeting in 2016, and Panama will host it in 2018. We expect that Panama will have more things to show and more advances for 2018, as we move forward in the execution of our 2019 goals.</p><h4>How can AIG improve efficiency and transparency in the public sector?</h4><p>Besides the Digital Agenda as a planning and alignment tool, we have been training government IT personnel belonging to the different ministries and agencies to make better use of technology for decision-making, communicating with citizens, and using open data platforms for citizen information and also for public sector information, which contributes toward a more transparent government. We also manage the citizen contact center, the 311, which we upgraded in 2015 with mechanisms to measure citizen satisfaction with the service provided by the agencies. More and more people are using the 311 and they see that it is effective for solving their concerns. We have closed more than 92% of cases within the legal time frame, and support the agencies in improving their internal service processes with timely feedback and CRM tools. As an example, the Ministry of Environment is using the 311 service, which also utilizes geo-referenced capabilities, in order to integrate citizen alerts for environmental violations or environmental impact studies. This platform is similar to what we have developed for the geo-location of schools with the Ministry of Education and soon to release with the Transit Authority. There are similarities between what we are doing with these agencies and local governments in support of their citizens and private-sector interactions, with a comprehensive roadmap to become smart cities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We will offer new e-government online transactions in 2016, having approximately 100 that are nearly ready to be rolled out through the agencies. We will also make available a platform for open government, new mobile apps, a new generation of the government cloud, and new functionalities for the voice and data telecommunications network for the government, and continue to advance in the national Digital Agenda for modernizing the government. We plan to consolidate the discipline we are achieving with this government in the way we procure technology fostering healthy competition. We are making sure that all of our tender processes remain as transparent and as open as possible for government suppliers as we acquire the most appropriate technology that is required by the individual agencies. We are looking forward to Panama being one of the leading countries in e-government, as this is a key factor for remaining in one of the top places in the region in terms of competitiveness and attracting FDI.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major initiatives is Ahli Bank is focused on?</h4><p>Some people say branch banking is a bit of a sunset industry. I do not particularly think it is, but as we move forward we are investing in different channels like mobile and internet banking. We have developed business-to-business e-banking solutions. We are prioritizing digital solutions in addition to selective additional branch openings. When we launched Islamic banking, we opened six branches on the same day because we were not able to simultaneously launch internet banking. This is now about to be launched. We recently opened six customer service kiosks in shopping malls, which are open 10am to 10pm, with cash deposit/withdrawal machines. With most banks embracing the digital transformation, it is a very broad category, and our challenge will be to differentiate Ahli from other banks in terms of products and pricing. We are focusing on our turnaround times, complaint management handling, and customer service.</p><h4>How are you able to attract new customers, foreign or domestic?</h4><p>Increasingly remote (or digital cellular) banking is important because most people have access to mobile phones. We can integrate a full banking model in this manner, to reach customers throughout Oman. We attract many new customers through word of mouth. For example, although we have not yet advertised Islamic mortgage pricing, we are struggling to keep up with demand. In terms of new companies coming into Oman, we benefit from our partnership with Ahli United Bank in making introductions through its regional offices in other countries. In particular, we are serving incoming investment from Egypt and Kuwait, both directly and through the free zones.</p><h4>How would you describe the health of the banking sector today?</h4><p>I have actually worked in five GCC countries, all but Qatar. In Oman, the banking sector is in good shape. Despite the economic crash, there have been no bank failures here because banks are well regulated and well capitalized. They are consistently profitable and prudently managed. Within the region they have the lowest non-performing loans ratio of about 2%, and among the highest capital adequacy ratios.</p><h4>Will this confidence in banking fuel more investments throughout the country?</h4><p>I have no doubt about that because the capital investment project plan is significant, and we are seeing foreign direct investment coming in. When the oil price fell suddenly in December of last year, Oman was one of the countries described as being overly dependent on oil. The local stock market declined substantially, and many foreign investors withdrew money at that time. But interestingly, Oman was able to recover quickly because local investors saw value and put money into the stock market, which rebounded quickly. This shows us that investors have confidence in the securities market and those firms listed on it.</p><h4>How will this confidence be maintained in the coming years?</h4><p>Despite the sudden drop in oil prices, the government actually increased its budgeted expenditure by 4% in 2015. It listed expected sources of revenue and showed allocated expenses, so it was clear that the program of government-led investment would continue. The budget at that time was based on an average price of $75. Though this may or may not be the case this year, it is clear that the government has adequate resources from various areas, to bridge the budget deficit forecast. We are seeing the economy diversifying, and there are great opportunities beyond oil and gas.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges facing the banking sector?</h4><p>The biggest challenge might prove to be the liquidity in the banking sector and the market. In the GCC, in respect of their banking sectors, governments tend to be the largest depositors, borrowers, and owners, whereby banking and government are comparatively more inter-dependent. My concern is replacing any withdrawal of government-linked deposits, and how this potential scenario might reflect to banks' capacity to lend. There is no indication that such withdrawals will occur, but it is important for banks to diversify their deposits and have standby lines of credit from foreign banks. We are also expecting the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates later in 2015, which should renew borrowers' appetite for interest rate hedging. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What peculiarities characterize the environment you are dealing with in Peru?</h4><p>In Peru, all players in the financial system use different terminology to refer to the concept of bonds and this also means certain differences with the international community. For example, financial institutions, companies, and organizations use different concepts when referring to bonds. From this point of view, there is sometimes confusion. In Peru we deal with Bonds at First Demand, which makes the underwriting very important.</p><h4>Do you work alongside public authorities to implement clearer rules for the system?</h4><p>We have done a lot of work with the public administration in terms of credit insurance, which is a useful tool for governments to boost foreign trade. The sector has seen a lot of innovation in the last few years, taking key steps forward. We are quite active with the government in this regard. We have an agreement with COFIDE within the Programa De Seguro De credito A La Exportación (SEPYMEX) program, which has been in place since 2002. As Secrex, we have an exclusive agreement through which every export of SMEs within Peru is covered by 50% by Secrex. Secrex has been one of the leading companies in the development of this program with our credit insurance products for exporting companies. This program has been very successful from the beginning and we have been strengthening and improving it.</p><h4>What role does new technology play in the development of the company?</h4><p>This is a major part of our development and we have signed partnerships to leverage our capabilities in this field. We are able to offer a more comprehensive service in terms of risk management thanks to new technologies. Innovation and new technologies are key elements in our activity, especially in the bonds area, which is one of the strongest segments in Peru for our company. We have applied new technologies in order to create automated underwriting to our products, such as performing bonds. We have done a lot of work in automating underwriting in custom agencies bonds. There are over 2,500 customs operators in this country. At the moment, around 60% of our performing bonds are within civil works and the remaining 40% are customs agencies and casinos. We have a strong focus on developing these latter two. We have made a great deal of effort to accompany foreign companies upon their arrival in Latin America as well, some of them from Spain, too. We offer the competitive advantages of our almost 35 years of local knowledge and experience combined with our international capabilities. This structure has slowed down the decision-making process, but strengthened our efficiency and global capabilities.</p><h4>What is the potential of Peruvian SMEs?</h4><p>The SEPYMEX program is the best example we can give and the fact that the government wants to extend it is a clear statement of the role these businesses are set to play in the future of the Peruvian economy. We have seen SMEs reaching many new markets in the last few years and this is thanks to the export capabilities of this country, regardless of its size. For example, agribusiness is one of the sectors with the greatest potential for the near future. We have seen some successful cases in the last couple of years and we will see many more. SMEs have great potential for export activity due to the fact that Peruvian products are sold at higher prices in foreign markets.</p><h4>What other sectors will underpin Peru's future growth?</h4><p>Apart from agribusiness, the mining industry is set to play a key role in Peru's future development. Peru has large mineral resources and, despite these being mainly non-insurable commodities, we see more sophisticated derivate products, and those are the ones with big potential for us and for our products such as credit insurance. For example, we have a customer exporting to as many as 55 different countries. These products have greater added value than the raw minerals alone, and we think there is a lot to do in this field.</p><h4>How do you see Secrex evolving in the near future?</h4><p>We would like to introduce certain products and programs we have in Spain; for example, in Spain, credit insurance was dying out due to the extreme competition in prices and players being extremely pushy. That changed with the construction bubble and financial crisis that hit the country a few years ago. Competitiveness was based only on the premium we charged and that led us to try to think differently, offering other aside services not to bring down prices, which was one of the main trends. This was also driven by the necessity to reduce the impact of bad claims we had back then. In this context, we developed the “CESCE Master Oro" Policy, introducing variable prices, breaking the global paradigm prevailing in the industry. This has evolved into the “Pay-Per-Cover Policy" or the “Full Cover" we have in place now, in which the customer decides what they want to insure. Overall, we offer a more personalized product in a more attractive platform on the internet, changing the way the sector operates. We work on the implementation of these services and products in Peru and we will bring some good news in the near future.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the new innovations and technological advances that have been made by OAB?</h4><p>Banking services are evolving, along with a wider acceptance of electronic channels as secure and convenient, complementing brick-and-mortar branch banking. We are gearing up for this digital transformation by investing heavily in technology to improve transactional banking, specifically focusing on retail and cash management services. OAB wants to take it one step further by providing something truly innovative and market leading. Aptra Activate, for example, is one of the most advanced ATM software that is designed for a multi-channel banking environment. OAB is the first Bank in Oman to acquire this technology, which will improve operational efficiency, security, and customer experience. OAB will also be introducing state-of-the art Omni-channel platforms to meet customer expectations of consistent service across multiple delivery channels, along with streamlining processes at customer interactions. Furthermore, the introduction of a new electronic workflow system improves the turn-around-time for loan approvals, improving efficiencies, and enhancing customer satisfaction.</p><h4>How does the recent agreement with the Administrative Court regarding e-payments align with the bank's strategy to develop technologically?</h4><p>The agreement came as a catalyst to expedite our development in that field. Our strategy has always been to provide a technologically advanced platform for e-payments. Many payments go through government bodies, which is in line with government initiatives to do more electronically. The bank is on a good platform with the court through this agreement, and it puts us in a good position to seek further involvement with various ministries.</p><h4>How does OAB currently provide for SMEs?</h4><p>SME business is an interesting area and servicing SMEs in the Sultanate is something we enjoy doing. At OAB, the business operating model heavily involves the various branches that are located throughout the country. SMEs appreciate efficiency and are cost-aware, so they prefer to pass by the branches, especially those outside Muscat, in order to have that personal touch. All OAB staff are local to the region. Our staff call clients by their first names, and the branch feels like an extension of home to these merchants, contractors, or business owners. Often, as part of our social responsibility, we become financial advisers. Instead of focusing on profitability, we try to see, through these companies, what is best for the local community on the long term.</p><h4>OAB also has strong equity management. How does this arm of the bank operate?</h4><p>OAB's fully fledged investment banking division is licensed to operate across a wide spectrum of capital market activities. We are well established in asset management, covering funds and discretionary portfolio management, apart from brokerage, custody, research, corporate finance, private equity and margin financing.  In addition, the Non Residence Indians (NRIs) business is very strong in Oman, and we are servicing them well. Using our alliances in UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and the Levant though Arab Bank Group, we provide services across the region. In terms of market share and ranking, we are among the top three custody and brokerage firms, while in asset management we have almost 15% of the market share. It is worth mentioning that out of the 60 IPOs executed in Oman, OAB actively participated in most of them in various capacities such as Lead Manager, Financial Advisor, Placement Agent and Collecting Bank.   </p><h4>Looking at trade finance, how does OAB support the import/export segment?<br></h4><p>This is a traditional line of business that OAB has been doing for decades. Arab Bank Group plays a significant role in our success formula because it is a global bank that provides tremendous business and logistical support to us in addition to market intelligence. We stay active in terms of multinational companies interested in doing business in Oman via a dedicated international banking team, and we also promote the Sultanate as an attractive and viable investment haven. In June, we were in Italy, in July we were in UK, and we will be in Turkey as part of the official delegations that are engaging with the international community to promote Oman as a trade and investment partner. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the main trends and drivers in the Omani banking industry over the past year, and what are your projections for the coming year?</h4><p>During 2014, the performance of commercial banks continued to remain favorable. The financial health of banks in terms of assets quality, provision coverage, capital adequacy, and profitability remained strong. Apart from the policy initiative of the CBO, the major drivers of growth in the banking sector have been strong levels of government expenditure, adequate liquidity, increasing domestic demand, and a favorable demography. The balance sheet of commercial banks further strengthened due to the robust growth in both deposits and credit. Though the current low oil price is posing a challenge to the Omani economy, given the resilience of the economy and prudent fiscal and monetary policies, it would be possible to maintain the trajectory of growth in the banking sector achieved in recent years. The government and the CBO seek to achieve this through intensifying efforts related to the development of SMEs, developing the financial sector, financing the private sector, improving the investment climate, and developing infrastructure. The State General Budget 2015 also endeavors to continue investment spending despite lower oil prices. It is expected that the demand for banking products will continue to increase even with lower oil prices. Banks are also efficiently and effectively building up their capacity in terms of higher capital, exposure, and leveraging abilities, technological capabilities, and foreign currency funding sources. The advent of Islamic banking is expected to further diversify banking services and expand financial inclusion. The CBO will continue to monitor the liquidity situation and ensure that adequate liquidity is available for banks to lend to growing sectors and meet the credit demand. Thus, with greater participation of commercial banks in the development process, together with large investments by the government, the balance sheet and profits of commercial banks are expected to remain healthy.</p><h4>In the past two years, Islamic banking practices have dramatically expanded in Oman. Do you expect this trend to continue?</h4><p>Islamic banking in the Sultanate is progressing well. There are already two fully fledged Islamic banks and six local banks have established windows for practicing Islamic banking. There has been a considerable increase in the number of branches and assets held by these banks. Islamic banking entities provided finance to the extent of $2.5 billion as at the end of December 2014 compared to $1.2 billion in December 2013. Total deposits held with Islamic banks and windows also registered a substantial increase to $1.78 billion by the end of 2014 from $444 million a year ago. It is too early to judge the performance of Islamic banks vis-í -vis other banks; however, Islamic banks are opening up new segments and players, and, thus, adding to the competitive environment not only in terms of efficiency and innovation, but by also providing the consumers the benefit of choosing between both conventional and Islamic banking products. Given the growing social and business needs of the country, Islamic banking is expected to assume an important position in the financial sector of the Sultanate by complementing the current conventional banking and will diversify banking services and augment financial inclusion.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges associated with the bank's portfolio?</h4><p>The CBO is fully aware of the need to increase credit to the productive sector, in particular for the SME segment, and has advised banks to formulate liberal lending policies, as well as mandated banks to allocate at least 5% of their total credit to SMEs by December 2015. Similarly, the quantitative ceiling on personal loans have been reduced and banks have to operate within a ceiling of 35%, while residential housing loans can be extended so that the quantitative ceiling on personal loans will help the corporate sector to avail more credit if genuine demand arises. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What investment opportunities are there between the UAE and markets in Africa?</h4><p>Three years ago, we added two main regions to our plans—East and West Africa and Central Asia, although we cover the whole world. We are very strong in the conventional areas, but we want to open new areas for our private business, which are difficult for a single company to go to. We went on a trade mission to Kenya, Uganda, and now my team is in Rwanda. Because it is very difficult for a single company to go to these markets in terms of security and logistics, we gather a group. The opportunities in these countries are huge—there is demand for everything from consumables, finished products, raw materials, construction materials, and food products to confectionaries. All of these are strong in Dubai, either from manufacturing or from re-exporting. The growth rate in these countries for the last few years has been very high, not less than 5-8% a year. This is a large growth rate compared to the rest of the world. For example, DP World manages a few seaports in Africa like Senegal and Djibouti and there are a few more under construction. Another factor is that business and the tourists from East African countries coming to the UAE understand that Dubai is a regional hub, so when they come here they are also exposed to India and other GCC countries. From Dubai they can carry out bilateral trade, not only with us, but also with the rest of the world.</p><h4>What strategy do you follow when opening offices overseas?</h4><p>We are currently in the second phase of our plan. We have offices in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and India as part of phase one. And the second phase, which is finalized, is Russia to cover the Central Asian market, and Germany to cover Europe and Brazil. Brazil is one of the top economies in the world with a population of 200 million, so it is a big market for our private business. With these offices, we cover more than one-third of the world. The future plan is to cover Asia in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and also Australia. We hope that, by 2016, we will finalize both Asia and Africa.</p><h4>How is DEDC helping Dubai engage with key stakeholders and identify new areas for collaboration with the US?</h4><p>Our conventional markets, like Europe and the US, will continue growing. We have several missions to Canada and the US, either by us as Dubai Exports, or the Ministry of Economy or Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, because the main business with the US is mature, we are looking at different sectors, mainly innovation and creativity and high technology. We had a couple of visits with the Ministry of Economy to look at things like business incubators or innovation cities, so that we can develop some kind of technology transfer or learn from their experience to attract companies. We want innovation and creativity to be a part of our lives, not just in terms of technology, but also when it comes to management, education, healthcare, and beyond. We also have a mission in the US with the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) to attract US investment companies to Dubai to use the Emirate as a hub for the region. The DMCC covers commodities including gold, silver, and even tea, coffee, pepper, and saffron. We want to show US companies the capabilities of the DMCC and how to establish themselves in the UAE. We also organized a couple of missions with Fahad Al Gergawi, CEO of Dubai FDI, to the US to meet US companies in niche products that are not dependent on high labor. Most of the US companies are only looking at the US or Europe, so we want them to see the capability of Dubai and the region.</p><h4>What will be the key elements contributing to the growth of halal processed food and what will be the potential export markets?</h4><p>Halal production and halal food is more comprehensive than conventional food because everyone can eat it. Halal is not just a religious product; it is a high-quality, hygienic product complying with high standards and also with sharia. Halal is not just for Muslims. Dubai wants to be the capital of the Islamic economy. One part of that is halal manufacturing and halal food. Dubai now has fully fledged halal standards that cover the entire food spectrum in the manufacturing of food, which is published online so companies can learn exactly how to comply. We are promoting the halal industry as a whole, which includes Islamic finance, takaful insurance, and also halal manufacturing. We are getting suppliers from all around the world to come to Dubai. We want them all to come to Dubai to use Dubai as the halal hub for all these consumers, which include Arab countries, the GCC, Iran, Iraq, Central Asia, Western China, and beyond.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Based on the innovation and creativity initiative, we have also come up with an innovation in exports. The conventional market will continue to grow, but we want to promote innovation. We are exploring how to promote fashion out of Dubai, as well as cosmetics and perfume, mainly in terms of services rather than the product itself. We want to promote UAE companies dealing with these innovative services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The University of Ghana was founded in 1948. What are the main changes you have seen at the institution since you graduated in 1978?</h4><p>I returned to the university in 1986 to teach and I have been here ever since. A lot has changed in that period, and it is a much larger institution today than it was during my time as a student. When I was enrolled here there were 5,000 students. Today that number is close to 40,000 and the faculty has also grown to offer more disciplines. The university did not offer a program in Engineering Sciences before, and we also now offer programs in pharmacy, veterinary medicine, and many more areas. We have introduced more professional disciplines alongside the traditional academic disciplines.</p><h4>How do you expect the composition of undergraduates and postgraduates to change moving forward as a research university?</h4><p>Our student body is currently made up of about 15% postgraduates and 85% undergraduates. We are undertaking more and more research involving graduate students, and our target is to reach an equal distribution of students in the two groups within the next 10 years. In order to achieve that, we need to invest in equipment and attract more graduates by offering more PhD programs. Increasing the intake of graduate students requires more extensive preparation; we need more rooms for graduate students, we need to invest in new technologies, we need to attract research grants and projects, and we are in the process of doing all of these. We have recently negotiated an investment of $64.4 million in new buildings on the campus. We have also identified a number of key research areas that will help us attract new grants. We are undertaking a lot of research on malaria and climate change adaptation, and we are working on food security as well as poverty monitoring and evaluation. Even though these four are not the only areas that we are working on, this is where we put our resources, and we hope to attract additional grants. This is a university that is putting much more emphasis on research than any other university in Ghana.</p><h4>What are your primary sources of funding?</h4><p>About 10 years ago, as much as 90% of our revenues came from the government, but that has now decreased to around 60%. Students are contributing more and we are increasingly bringing in more third-party grants, particularly from Europe. We currently have a large grant from the World Bank and another large one from the Wellcome Trust in the UK. We also receive funding for smaller projects from several different organizations, including foundations all over the world. The International Development Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada is a major source of funding for small projects. We belong to a number of international university consortia and networks and these facilitate access to international resources. The latest such network that we have joined is the Worldwide Universities Network, which brings together 18 universities from different countries, only two of which are in Africa. The idea is to collaborate on selected areas of research. Partnership with well-established universities in the global north is also often helpful. Some of the strongest collaborators we have are Washington University in St. Louis and Rochester University. In the UK, we have strong links to the universities of Cambridge and Oxford, the London School of Economics, Sussex, and several others.</p><h4>What role would you like universities to play in helping governments find sustainable economic development models?</h4><p>Universities can play a major role in changing the fortunes of developing nations. Universities traditionally do research and train the human resources required for national development. We are increasingly providing advisory services to government, which is important in a country like ours. Ghana requires significant human resources in policy making and implementation, and universities have some of the best resources for this. It makes sense to have a strategy that allows universities to participate regularly in discussions of strategy for sectors such as agriculture, health, education, industry, and finance. Universities in Ghana could ideally be more actively consulted in the future; this is what universities in developing countries should be used for.</p><h4>Ghana suffers from high unemployment. What do you see as the solution for this?</h4><p>Any economy has to develop in a carefully pre-determined direction in order to best make use of the available human resources. There has to be a clear strategy on how to use the available skills to transform the economy. The training of young people should be carefully thought through to ensure that they would be contributing to transformation in many different ways. We spend a lot of time training engineers, but we somehow neglect the development of industry. It does not matter how many engineers we train if we do not have an acceptable industrial policy. Without a developed industrial sector many of them will remain unemployed. We have to strategize the pursuit of growth. And to do that, we need to focus on manufacturing goods including textiles and pharmaceuticals. If that is deemed the right direction for the country's economy, then universities can focus on the type of skills needed for the endeavor. We produce 10,000 graduates each year, but we know that there would not be enough jobs for them immediately. We often get blamed for not producing the “right" kind of graduate. Simply blaming universities for not producing the right kind of graduates is not going to solve any problems; we need a comprehensive strategy.</p><h4>What is your overall aim for your four areas of research?</h4><p>We chose those four areas because these are the areas where we can most comprehensively contribute to national development. African institutions have a much bigger incentive to search for a malaria vaccine than anybody else. Without investigating and coming up with solutions for issues of climate change, all the things that we talk about in relationship to the structure of economies mean nothing. There are few African countries that produce enough food, and relying on imports is not easily affordable. We are therefore focusing on things like seed multiplication, developing high yielding varieties of crops, improving crops, and improving seed quality. Our fourth area of research is poverty monitoring and evaluation, as social protection methods are becoming more important in developing countries. Without meaningful methods of quantitatively understanding the most at risk members of the population, social protection initiatives become meaningless. We need to generate the data that will allow policy makers to properly target social protection. There should be a commitment to bringing together all of the people who know something about the issue. Our government must bring together all the people that can contribute to finding solutions from universities, the private sector, and from abroad.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I expect our scholarly publications to increase significantly. Some of the work from the grants we received two or three years ago is now nearing completion. We have a lot of work being done in the Biochemistry Department and also in the Chemistry Department on toxins and other compounds. Our teams working on climate change are making major contributions to global debates. A number of our faculty are undertaking research on non-communicable diseases, and we expect them to publish much in the coming year. One of the good things that has happened in the last few years is the hiring of a number of young academics that earned PhDs in Europe and the US. These young scholars are enthusiastic about publishing as they believe they have something to prove. We expect this new growth to be reflected in more relevant publications of a higher quality. Obviously, we have to make improvements to our infrastructure, and we have already begun redoing our roads and walkways. The University of Ghana will become a much different place over the next few years.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Right Mindset]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-right-mindset]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Regarding your investments in ICT, how does the KR Group specifically focus on innovation?</h4><p>In terms of innovation, ICT is the enabler. We have invested $5 million in software and hardware solutions. We dedicate 20 people to supporting the system of knowledge sharing. It has made us that much more efficient, and brought about the difference we were seeking. It has already given us a competitive edge. We are in the business of supply chain logistics, infrastructure, and consumer distribution. About four years ago we started the huge process of completely upscaling and upgrading our ICT network, so we contracted with SAP. It was a huge task, involving millions of dollars worth of software, but it is not just about buying it and plugging it in as it does not work like that; it needs a whole process and change of mindset, which is the most difficult part. So we went through that and we had our hiccups like every other company has but we came out of it unscathed and a much better, more efficient firm. With that in hand, we went further down and built a huge integrated mechanized warehousing system. From small units in many small warehouses, we went into one large integrated mechanized warehouse, where we installed a warehouse management system (WMS), which was then backward integrated into the ICT system, and this now makes us an efficient player for supply chain logistics. More efficiency means more control, and more control means more profits. </p><h4>Logistics is one of your most important services. Regarding the whole group, what different focuses have you had over the past year?</h4><p>We built a fully mechanized, integrated warehouse for our consumer group, one of the most advanced in the Middle East, and we opened this in 2014. This greatly improved our efficiency, integrating eight locations into one. Many of our other divisions wanted to be a part of this as a result, and it necessitated a doubling of capacity in just one year. We provide on-site accommodation for 350 staff. The warehouse serves an area of some 200km, putting some two-thirds of Oman's population within our reach. This gives us greater communication efficiency, and supply chain and distribution efficiency. We are open to JVs and ready to engage with other stakeholders to pursue other areas of expansion in logistics and supply chain. We are committed to becoming a responsible service provider by adopting as many SMEs to propose an all-inclusive development strategy, especially in areas like Duqm and other free zones.</p><h4>How does KR cater to the SMEs that are looking to expand their operations?</h4><p>What we have done is try to encourage truck owners to work with us, guaranteeing them a certain amount of business. In other words, we are outsourcing catering, supplies, cleaning services, maintenance, and pest control. We are encouraging drivers to invest in their vehicles, so we can outsource deliveries also. You must realize that an SME does not come about by itself. An SME is nothing but an ancillary to an existing industry. You cannot promote an SME by itself; you need to promote an industrial sector, or a cluster, at which point the SMEs will come in. You cannot promote micro industry without a major industry off which these small micro industries feed. For example, if Sohar is a cluster for petrochemicals, aluminum, and steel, we need to identify which ancillary industries flourish behind a steel industry, an aluminum cluster, and a petrochemical cluster. We need to now look at countries like Brazil, India, and Indonesia, where there are petrochemical clusters, steel clusters, and aluminum clusters, and what the ancillary industries there are and then come back and implement them here to see what will flourish or not flourish. A business will not flourish unless it can feed on something. For an ancillary you need an anchor, a cluster, or a sector that already exists.</p><h4>What are your views on the situation regarding human development in the industry?</h4><p>We have nearly 42% Omanization at the company. We are investing in people by developing the middle management, in particular via special training courses in India. They return motivated and with high morale. These programs encourage them to be very focused and they return to Oman keen to illustrate their newfound skills. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the authority position itself in the Omani economy, and what is your focus, particularly for this year?</h4><p>The authority provides many support programs such as trainings, exhibitions, incubation, and awards. The themes of the trainings are, for example, how to establish a business, business management, accounting, and marketing. We also organize specialized courses on hygiene, health, and safety, among others. On top of this, we assist in technical issues related to project management and execution. The authority also facilitates finding solutions when issues arise between SMEs and government authorities, larger companies, and banks, of course within its legal mandate and capacity only. At the end of 2014, we established an incubator. We have currently around 13 incubatees out of 23 offices available in the incubator. Our plan is to have the operation up to 100% at the end of 2015, and to have a process in place by which we can assess how incubatees are benefitting from our services to improve ourselves. Riyada signed a contract to run the existing incubator with the National Business Center (NBC), which has the necessary experience and knowledge in this field. </p><h4>What are the sectors of interest in terms of start-ups, and which sectors are the authority's priorities at the moment?</h4><p>For now, we are focusing in services mainly and studying the ways to establish specialized incubators. We are discussing with the concerned Government Authorities the formation of agricultural and industrial incubators. We hope some projects will materialize by the end of this year. </p><h4>In terms of skilled labor, what are the current gaps existing, and what is the role of SMEs in filling those gaps?</h4><p>Gaps exist, but we see many initiatives in Oman to eliminate or at least reduce those gaps. A key part of the authority's role is to equip Omanis with the necessary skill-set so they can establish their own businesses. We focus on providing assistance to small businesses to grow as well as new graduates from high schools and universities to implement their business ideas and establish their own enterprises. At the start, Omanization levels are lower for new businesses. After they have established themselves over time, there will be a gradual Omanization program introduced.</p><h4>What sort of opportunities will present themselves in the next few years for SMEs, and in which areas does the authority anticipate their growth?</h4><p>There are certain sectors that we are in and will be focusing on over the next five years; specifically tourism and logistics. There are huge opportunities for SMEs in logistics. There are major opportunities in business linked to transport, clustered around the major national railway projects. Companies in the railway sector are already working on strategies to create opportunities for SMEs. The tourism sector also presents many opportunities for SME establishment and growth. The idea is to link the SMEs to the sectors on which the government is currently focused. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the coming year, as well as your longer-term outlook for SMEs?</h4><p>There is a focus on the importance of SMEs in Oman, and it will be one of the key elements to achieve the shift from oil and achieve economic diversification. Many government authorities agree that SMEs will play a major role in this. There is huge potential for SMEs to grow in Oman in the next five years and beyond. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[whats-trending]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you provide a brief background of the evolution of Amouage, looking at its roots in Oman as well as the more recent developments that the brand has made?</h4><p>Amouage was founded 33 years ago in Oman with the intention to take the brand to the international market. In order to achieve this, nine years ago, we completely repositioned the brand and designed an entirely new portfolio of products, as well as a new logo and packaging. We changed the marketing of the brand toward the international consumer. Amouage changed dramatically from when we started this repositioning. Today, we have an extensive and wonderful portfolio of sophisticated and complex fragrances, as well as other categories of product such as bath, home, and leather goods. Our Creative Director, Christopher Chong, is a renowned figure within the perfume world for his creative mastery to produce complex and unusual fragrances. Now, the brand is truly international and the benefit of this means it has grown significantly in only a short amount of time, to the point where Amouage is now one of the largest niche luxury fragrance brands in the world. All of our creative and product development happens in London. Around 60% of the fragrances are manufactured in Oman; however, the rest are made in Europe and in the UK in order to take advantage of EU trade tariffs. Our London office handles sales to Europe, including Russia North America, and South America, which have recently opened up as a market.</p><h4>How has technology and social media impacted the brand?</h4><p>Technology helps us to manufacture the right products at the right time. It also allows you to predict demand more effectively. In addition, it increases our productivity tremendously and reduces our stock wastage. Technology has enabled us to buy closer to the time of requirement, thereby allowing us to completely redesign our warehouse's logistical functions, both in London and Oman. Efficiency, therefore, has been increased and costs lowered. Technology allows us to examine creative ideas through our branding design much quicker and visualize ideas better before we press the button to go ahead. Technology also enables us to talk to our consumer on a more regularly basis. We can then update them on new launches and other initiatives. Social media is a double-edged sword; however, as there will always be people with negative criticisms, which is something we have to deal with in a professional manner; however, there is also praise. On top of this, when consumers write to a brand they expect an immediate response, and if they do not receive one it can cause them incredible frustration. To maintain a full social media platform, therefore, is a time consuming and expensive process, as it needs 24-hour staffing.</p><h4>What are the major plans or targets you have for the brand in the coming years?</h4><p> Our current growth strategy is through both retail and wholesale. We have just signed on for shops in Nizwa and Milan, and we will continue our search for the right retail sites across the key opinion forming cities in the world. In our wholesale business, we intend to identify sites within all quality third party accounts, so that the brand can be seen in its own environment and its message be recognized as much as possible. We have some excellent launches coming out in 2016, and we plan to build on the success we have achieved to date. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does Oman's statistics center compare to the rest of the GCC?</h4><p>We created our own statistics center here in Oman, and we are following the same standards as the GCC, which follow international standards. We are running the same program as the GCC, and we are moving together. We believe that statistics need to be up to these standards so that we avoid gaps in information given to policy makers.</p><h4>How is NCSI using smart applications to provide social and economic indicators, and what is the importance of the census in Oman?</h4><p>One of our policies is that people have the right to information, and from this view we try to open channels for people to gain access to information. One of those channels is our website, and we are now improving our portal, both in Arabic and English. We have mobile applications and have created three applications. NCSI Oman gives social economic indicators, NCSI GEO is more detailed and geographic, and Tour Oman is focused on tourism. This is more of a service we provide than purely information. We also maintain a presence on social media. We plan to conduct an e-census in 2020 to replace the traditional census. We believe that innovation is essential.</p><h4>How is NCSI able to reach a wider audience in Oman, and what mediums are being utilized?</h4><p>We have tried to move into many channels because every channel has its own audience. Most young people go toward social media, and our people respond directly to them. We have a quick response rate. At least twice a week in Oman, you can find information in most Arabic and English newspapers, and we have updates on television. With our new portal we are reaching a lot of young people, and we signed an MoU with Qaboos University to see how we can use their research people and train their students here. We can be sure that this knowledge is being transferred from generation to generation. Now, we are signing many MoUs, nationally and internationally, to encourage exchange of experience. The UN has announced a call for big data, and Oman is leading a mobile task team.</p><h4>What is your coordination with other Oman government agencies and the private sector? </h4><p>NCSI, according to the royal decree, coordinates with all other government agencies. The data flows from them to us, and we send it back for their use. NCSI is responsible for all the economic and social information. Dissemination of information is helping to improve the level of transparency in the government. People have a right to access information and measure the progress of our country. We want to be sure there is communication happening and a link between the government and the private sector. One of our board members is from the private sector. </p><h4>What has been the effect of the drop in oil prices?</h4><p>According to our information, 2015 has already been a big challenge. Our economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas prices.  We assist in decision-making, but we are not making the decisions. Our information helps decision-makers see other scenarios. </p><h4>What trends are occurring this year, and what are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>According to last year's GDP, up to September, there was growth around 5%. It is still early to forecast what will change. In March 2015, Oman was one of three countries chosen to share our vision on big data; along with the Netherlands and Italy. This was our last statistic commission, and one that shows that Oman has an important place in the world. We are working to establish Oman as a national center to provide all data and information, and we are creating a smart government with a national data warehouse. Information is power, and we can see where the opportunities lie. We are on the right track, yet there are still many things to do in the future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Last year you said that the ratio of expatriate workers in the Sultanate must not exceed 33%. To what extent was Omanization successful in 2014?</h4><p>The Ministry of Manpower pays high interest to providing job opportunities to citizens through preparing and recruiting them. The national employees in the private sector in 2015 reached 218,852. Vacancies were 62,723. Job seekers utilizing such vacancies numbered 40,178, including 2,470 trainees. </p><h4>Why does each sector implement a different Omanization target? How much do various industries respond to this government initiative?</h4><p>The Omanization target is subject to the ministerial decision no. 321/2009, employment seminars, and sectorial committees supervising the private sector. Such committees set forth Omanization plans and mechanisms of training and recruitment. The possibility of implementing the Omanization target differs from one sector to another depending on the potential of each sector. There were positive experiences with businessmen as the decisions were made in view of economic and social considerations.</p><h4>What are the details of the Ministry's decision to allow Omani students to work part time?</h4><p>As part of the endeavors to provide job and training opportunities to graduates of technical colleges, vocational training centers, and fishermen institutes, the Ministry issued a ministerial decision regarding the organization of part-time jobs on the condition that work hours do not exceed four hours a day and the daily wage must not be less than OMR3 per hour. The recruitment is confined to Omani job seekers only. Firms are allowed to employ those who are over 16 between 6.00am and 6.00pm. The part time workforce must not exceed 10% of the Omanization target defined. Part-time recruiting is confined to the private sector facilities of foodstuff selling, fuel filling, restaurants, hotels, cafés, electronic and electric appliance stores, car agencies, agricultural works, money exchange, child and elderly care, travel and tour offices, vehicle driving, and educational and medical services.</p><h4>To what extent does the Ministry of Manpower contribute to the advancement of students and entrepreneurs?</h4><p>In response to the expectations of the youth and the government's orientations to upgrade human resources to develop their capabilities in order to achieve the desired goal of advancing education and vocational training programs based on an evolved system, the Ministry made unremitting efforts to link education outputs with the requirements of the labor market. The Ministry also seeks to develop and improve vocational training centers and fishermen rehabilitation institutes to keep abreast of developments in education and vocational training according to the requirements of the current and coming stages. In addition, the Ministry has made new steps toward vocational education and training, promoting it to the status of high education, recognizing its important role in developing human resources to fulfill the requirements of national development. The Ministry has also provided entrepreneurs and businessmen with a set of e-services to simplify the measures and access the information they need in an easy and smooth way. It also introduced facilities to support SMEs, including exempting SMEs from the Omanization target for professions and activities permissible, implementing a number of programs that help SMEs recruit an expatriate workforce, enhancing the work environment along with carrying out programs, courses, and studying and training curriculums in technical colleges, vocational training centers, and fishermen rehabilitation institutes. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of the last 12 months for the Ministry, in terms of what has been done to increase competitiveness in the country, especially for SMEs?</h4><p>Our priority has been to increase competitiveness and the ease of doing business in Oman. In recent years, we lost a few positions in our competitive ranking in some categories that we are already trying to improve, like how easily you do business, human resources availability, certain laws, and regulations. The first and most important thing is that we have accelerated our Invest Easy Commercial Registration, which is an e-registration platform. During this year, we have launched a series of nearly 30 online services. The possibility for users to set up a business online is, without a doubt, a massive step forward for the sector. Electronic Commercial Registration speeds up process and reduces administrative procedures significantly. Through our platform, we also allow users to browse in our database without having to ask us for permission. People can thus obtain useful and up-to-date information about the market and the sector they operate in, in order to ensure safe online navigation. There is an interactive online link with the Royal Oman Police so that the registry automatically reads the users' ID cards, preventing any attempt of fraud. The system also has an interactive connection with the Ministry of Manpower for easy reference. Our customers must have a PKI on their phones to gain full access to our digital services use digital signature, which is now a legal form of authentication. By March 2016, Invest Easy users will be able to transfer all or part of their equities to each other through a PKI framework without having to visit our offices. Thanks to all these changes, foreign investors no longer have to come to Oman for setting up companies or changing company details or to submit end of the year accounts, etc. As long as we have the investors phone numbers supported by a PKI, we will grant them all remote access to our Commercial Registration Platform, and they will receive an SMS confirmation for each operation they perform. Finally, the Invest Easy Database will allow a greater level of transparency, as it is available to everybody.</p><h4>What opportunities will come along with the Iran deal for the Omani commercial sector?</h4><p>Our trading with Iran has been growing over the past three years, but still not up to our expectations. Now we have regular flights by Oman Air to Iran with a plan to increase the number of flights to many Iranian cities. The Oman Ferry Company has done a few calls to Iranian ports and is considering a regular service. However, the most awaited deal to close is the gas pipeline between the two countries. It will benefit both economies, as it could take years for Iran to build a new LNG terminal while Oman, as you know, already has one active LNG terminal in Sur with spare capacity for export on their behalf. If our industries agree a good supply and a good price, we could stretch our gas reserves even longer. Iran has a large market, and experienced Omani companies can benefit from construction and maintenance contracts and bilateral trade between the two countries can flourish. There is also the potential of using Iran to cross to other markets through a corridor that goes from Oman to Kazakhstan, and other countries. We can import meat, wheat, and other commodities while exporting petrochemicals. Of course, the whole world wants to make business with Iran, so Oman will have to compete by offering high-quality goods and services. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What new areas of potential collaboration between the Netherlands and Oman were identified during your April 2015 visit to the Sultanate?</h4><p>Oman and the Netherlands have a long shared history. Ties between our two countries were first established in 1651, when Dutch traders visited Oman on their way to Persia and the Far East. The aim of my visit was to consolidate our partnership, focusing on infrastructure and logistics. In the Netherlands these industries have been designated as top sectors, or areas of economic activity in which Dutch businesses excel. Recently, the Sultanate identified logistics as one of the main drivers of diversification in an economy that still relies mainly on oil revenues. With this in mind, the Ministry of Transport &amp; Communications drafted the Sultanate of Oman Logistics Strategy 2040, hoping to create 80,000 logistics jobs. Dutch companies can make a valuable contribution. Thanks to the Port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands is a logistics hub and, like Oman, a gateway to its region. Many Dutch logistics experts can serve as advisers for this strategy. This shared interest will be developed further in the future. As minister for trade and aid, I believe business is key. But business is more than just profit. Dutch-Omani collaboration goes beyond economic gain. I see great potential in the area of corporate social responsibility (CSR); our two countries can help each other promote more sustainable ways of doing business that benefit business, the environment and society. In fact, our embassy in Muscat is currently looking into CSR knowledge exchange and collaboration between Omani and Dutch companies as well as government bodies. We are consulting stakeholders in Oman on the value of establishing a CSR forum in the logistics sector. CSR and logistics are both areas in which the Netherlands is recognized as having considerable expertise.</p><h4>On that visit, you offered specialized training on logistics and statistics to Omani experts. How will such training facilitate business development between your countries?</h4><p>The training courses aim to introduce Omani experts to logistics and statistics in the Netherlands. The overall goal is knowledge exchange, but it could open up opportunities for trade, too. We see many other opportunities for knowledge exchange. For instance, Oman's national statistics center has developed impressive apps for phone users that help share statistical information with a broad audience, while Statistics Netherlands has devised a model to calculate logistics' share of GDP. If you combined those two, it would enable Oman to monitor the actual growth of its logistics sector.</p><h4>The Port of Sohar and the Port of Rotterdam enjoy a strong relationship. Furthering this position, a joint venture has recently been set up between the Omani government and the Port of Rotterdam Authority to develop the Sohar Freezone. What opportunities does this venture afford Dutch companies in Oman?</h4><p>The Sohar Freezone is part of the Port of Sohar project. It aims to stimulate foreign investors to set up business in and around the port. In addition to the Freezone, a new airport was opened recently. The Port of Rotterdam is in charge of managing the Freezone and is in contact with investors and businesses from around the world to promote investment and economic activity in the area. In recent years Dutch companies like C. Steinweg and Mobilift have set up operations at the port itself and in the vicinity. Sohar Freezone offers incentives that create a highly attractive environment for Dutch companies in which to start and expand their business in Oman. They include tax exemption, no customs duties, no personal income tax, and low capital requirements. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Vision 2020 continues to provide a long-term outline for modernizing the Sultanate in response to the changing global realities of the 21st century. For 45 years, Oman has been a model for establishing an unwavering level of peace and economic prosperity based on integrating the available resources to best serve the interests of everyone. Entering this new era, the traditional economic systems in place will require creative planning and committed effort to be adapted to the new conditions of a global society. Oman is continuing in its pursuit of sustainable development through a stable economic framework, diversification, and the enhancement of human development, while increasing the strength and competitiveness of the private sector.</p><p>One of the most pressing challenges of this age, particularly for Oman and its neighbors in the Gulf region, is the question of energy security. The efforts to develop the state, its institutions, and its people will all be hindered without a dependable energy infrastructure that is both economically viable and environmentally sustainable. Progress and development throughout the energy sector has allowed Oman to move closer toward the world-class energy supply upon which the continued growth of the Sultanate depends.</p><p>The determination to transition Oman toward a more diversified economy extends beyond the issue of establishing a sustainable energy supply. Oman's success in utilizing innovative renewable energy technologies to overcome the challenges of a hydrocarbon economy can be reproduced elsewhere in realizing the vision for the future of the Sultanate. Where prosperity was once dependent upon oil, the government is paving the way for generations of successful Omanis by enhancing the role of other sectors of the economy. The Sultanate is blessed with an abundance of natural beauty and a rich cultural heritage that drives the growth of the nation. The rest of the world is recognizing the richness of Oman, and continually increasing numbers of foreign visitors are an affirmation of its commitment to reorganize the basic economic framework.</p><p>The vehicle of driving any economy is its infrastructure. The projects that have been developed will continue to further improve the internal infrastructure of the Sultanate while strengthening the role that Oman can play within network of global economies. Oman is working together with the most well equipped private companies from around the world to carry out its initiatives for vast development projects. The ambitious growth of Duqm into what will become one of the world's most important centers for trading and logistics is an illustration of the potential to come together with the private sector to enhance Oman's economy.</p><p>Along with developing the Sultanate's infrastructure and its transformation into a knowledge-based society, highest among the official priorities is the enhancement of human development. It is the youth of the nation who will be responsible for realizing its illustrious plans. Creating an education system responsive to the needs of the 21st century is imperative to optimizing the capabilities of Oman's young people. Modernizing the educational curriculum to promote the important STEM fields will ensure a continued capacity to meet the challenges of tomorrow. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major milestones have been achieved in 2015?</h4><p>The most important milestone we recorded at NAFDAC in 2015 was the reduction of counterfeit anti-malaria drugs from a prevalence of about 20 to 30.6%. We also expanded into a brand new building in June 2015, which was another achievement with respect to developing the infrastructure of the agency. We received accreditation of a drug control laboratory in Yaba that was also designated as a Centre of Excellence.</p><h4>A total of nearly $4 billion is lost every year from Nigerian non-oil exports being rejected by international markets. What are you doing to get Nigerian products approved?</h4><p>This has been a big challenge. The EU rejected Nigerian food items and agricultural products from its countries because of low quality. The Japanese rejected Nigeria's sesame seed because of a high prevalence of aflatoxins and mycotoxins. The UK has rejected Nigerian agricultural products in the past because of the high content of pesticide residue. It rejected beans because the pesticide residue was higher than the approved global level. What we are trying to do now is to clean up that sector of the economy in order to ensure that our products are wholesome, for both local consumers and the export market. These agricultural products that are rejected by international markets are actually what we consume here locally. What we need to do to be able to identify the source of contamination is to go to each farm and test. We need to have a laboratory that moves around the state and tests the beans at each farm as well as in the marketplace where consumers are buying the products so that we can identify the source of the problem. With something like this in place, we can do select training with the farmers and identify the problems, as some of them are using banned pesticides that are obsolete and no longer approved by the international committee. If we do this, we should be able to again get our products accepted by the international market.</p><h4>What do you think increased enforcement and improved testing can bring to the development of the agricultural sector?</h4><p>Every year, Nigeria imports more than NGN4 billion in rice, more than NGN2 billion in sugar, and more than NGN600 billion in wheat, all of which requires money that we do not have right now because of dwindling state revenues. These are products that we could produce here in Nigeria and even export our excess production to increase our foreign exchange reserves. This intervention would significantly help turn around the agricultural sector and subsequently the whole economy. The agricultural sector by itself has the capacity to absorb the massive cohort of the country's unemployed youth through well-paid jobs if we can properly train them to work with new technology on farms.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve with the recent enforcement and increased scrutiny on firms across the economic spectrum?</h4><p>We scrutinized the pharmaceutical industry and helped it to improve its manufacturing practices. Four companies have been approved by the World Health Organization as meeting stringent global quality standards. There is no one standard for Nigeria, so everything we do should at least be to the same standard as global best practices. If firms want to be able to export their products to other countries, then they must meet the global standards.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is at the forefront of the Ministry of State for Youth Affairs' strategy to develop the youth in Kuwait?</h4><p>At the forefront of the Ministry of Youth Affairs (MYA) mission is the youth themselves. Essentially, the Ministry has arisen from the youth themselves, and is run by and for the youth. At its core, MYA is a facilitating, enabling, and empowering incubator that promotes positive youth development and provides services, opportunities, and a supportive environment for youth engagement across a myriad of different fields. With departments specializing in leadership development, capacity building, volunteerism, entrepreneurship, research and development, and creative content creation, the Ministry's very structure has been developed according to the needs of its community. Since its formation, it has supported the development of upward of 250 youth initiatives in the fields of science, education, art, health, leisure, and business. It has also partnered with key stakeholders in the public, private, and civil sectors on a number of youth-driven capacity-building projects. It has also worked with the country's top universities on educational programs and campaigns to address a number of societal issues affecting both the youth community and the country at large.</p><h4>Kuwait has a population of nearly 4 million, of which over 70-80% are expatriates. Of Kuwaitis, more than half of citizens are under the age of 25. In this demographic context, what key role do you see the Kuwaiti youth playing in Kuwait's economic future?</h4><p>I see the Kuwaiti youth playing a significant role in Kuwait's economic future. In fact, I will go so far as to say that, given the sharp decline of oil prices worldwide, without the youth, there is no long-term sustainable economic future for Kuwait. You see, Kuwait's economic future depends heavily on the creation of new industries. And no one is better positioned to do more with less and to take that risk than the youth themselves. In fact, one of the key roles that I see the Kuwaiti youth playing is that of problem-solvers. Young entrepreneurs have the imagination and necessary innovative skills to solve many of the socio-economic and infrastructural issues we face today.</p><h4>What are the main issues concerning youth in Kuwait? What hurdles do you see impeding their development and full potential?</h4><p>A crippled educational system, labor market restrictions, business regulation controls, poor administrative infrastructures, and the lack of viable incubators and venture capital injection are the major issues that stand in the way of youth development today. In addition, Kuwait has a low level of new industry creation due to the lack of a proper ecosystem that would in turn be able to manage and interweave all entrepreneurial aspirations. In order to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit in Kuwait, the Ministry continues to support and deliver a multitude of enabling projects in the SME creation and incubation fields.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Ministry of Youth, and the Kuwaiti economy, in 2016?</h4><p>I have many expectations for 2016 and beyond. The Kuwait Development Plan for 2035 aims at transforming Kuwait into a financial and international hub. But in order to do so, we must first fix the nation's existing educational system and overall human development plan. With today's dynamic global economy centered on the development and exchange of knowledge and information, the state must invest in capacity building and knowledge transference. Individuals and human capital need to develop multifaceted expertise. Skills must be fostered and nurtured to meet both the demanding needs of modern-day life as well as the innovation-driven global arena. We must recognize the importance of knowledge in value creation, enable a society of life-long learners, and encourage out-of-the-box thinkers and innovators to hold key decision-making positions in government. We must also invest in R&amp;D across all sectors and highlight the importance of a comprehensive educational backbone when re-structuring our much-neglected and dated public educational system. In addition, we must build platforms for creativity and expression; areas where new ideas and possibilities may be freely challenged and explored.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since opening, how have appointments and procedures been spread across the respective departments and services?</h4><p>Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is a multispecialty hospital serving primarily adult patients. We offer services in more than 30 different specializations across 12 institutes, including five centers of excellence in heart and vascular, neurological, eye, digestive disease, and respiratory and critical care. We also have institutes for medical subspecialties and for surgical subspecialties, both of which offer a complete suite of services in traditional internal medicine, such as head and neck surgery and urology. We do not treat children with the exceptions of the Eye Institute, because there is such a need locally for pediatric ophthalmology, and the 24/7 Emergency Medicine Institute.</p><h4>How does the hospital balance resources between medical tourism and domestic healthcare, undertaken as part of the national infrastructure?</h4><p>First and foremost, it is important to emphasize that Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is here to serve the local community—Emirati and expat patients who reside in Abu Dhabi and the wider UAE. This is our primary goal, to provide high-quality treatment that keeps Emirati patients and other residents in Abu Dhabi, thereby reducing the need to travel abroad for care. This obviously keeps them closer to their families and loved ones as well. This is the most important part of our mission. The second part of our mission is to ensure Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi makes a lasting change by contributing to the sustainable growth of Abu Dhabi's healthcare sector. An integral part of this effort is the development of Emirati leaders in healthcare and we are meeting this objective by supporting knowledge and skills transfer, particularly through research and innovation.</p><h4>The general strategy for the UAE healthcare sectors has been to attract highly qualified doctors and scientists, who will then train local medical staff, in order to develop the sector as a whole. How has Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi achieved this so far?</h4><p>We have had substantial success in attracting exceptional talent to Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. We believe this was the largest recruitment effort ever undertaken in healthcare. Approximately 80% of our institute chiefs and one-third of our total physician staff have Cleveland Clinic experience. That experience is important because they understand, firsthand, the model of care we are seeking to achieve in Abu Dhabi. It is important to have people onboard who understand what the end result should look like. All our physicians have on average 15 to 20 years' experience. Three-quarters of them have academic degrees and one-third are full professors. Most importantly, they share our vision and are motivated by the same guiding philosophy; to put patients first, uniting every caregiver in our organization to make a positive impact on the patient experience. We have organized our structure around the patients' needs and have brought in a workforce that fully supports that mission.</p><h4>Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is a Mubadala company that instills the American healthcare system across to Abu Dhabi. How does this provide stability and financial resources?</h4><p>Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is primarily here to complement the existing offerings in the Abu Dhabi market by bringing the first true replication of the US healthcare model outside of North America when it comes to highly specialized, complex care. In so doing, we are filling a need for acute and critical care within the healthcare sector. We are fortunate to have Mubadala as our partner in this endeavor. Our collaboration has been exceptionally strong and continues to be so. Without this joint effort, and the collaboration with regulators and the broader healthcare community, it would not have been possible to build this completely new, 4.4 million sqft campus. Furthermore, as part of the Mubadala network, we are able to collaborate with experts across different specialties and work together for the wider development of the healthcare sector. Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi is a large organization that employs more than 3,000 people. What makes us unique is how our singular focus on patients' needs drives our delivery model. We treat our patients using a group practice model of care. Pioneered by Cleveland Clinic, this model of care sees different specialized physicians working together to comprehensively diagnose and treat a patient's condition.</p><h4>What are some of the details of your collaboration on education?</h4><p>Cleveland Clinic has the third largest residency program in the US, with over 1,700 residents in its system. Furthermore, Cleveland Clinic is probably one of the most prolific hospital systems when it comes to the number of papers published as well as other annual academic contributions. We are using that foundation to offer continuing medical education to our caregivers—the term we use for everyone we employ—here in Abu Dhabi. In particular, we are leveraging Cleveland Clinic's academic expertise for the education of our Emirati colleagues. We have our first Emirati resident at Cleveland Clinic and have several more Emirati medical students who are going to go through the same process. This will allow our Emirati colleagues to be trained at Cleveland Clinic and then return to the UAE with a job in hand, providing us with a full educational cycle. In addition, we have a lot of educational content that is easily accessible online as well as digitally integrated tools that enable caregivers to participate in case conferences back in the US.</p><h4>What expansion and further development plans does Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi have here in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>A rising population and changing demographics are features of every society and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi's long-term strategy in the UAE could potentially provide for additional services as needs arise in the future. Currently, we are focused on delivering services offered at our 12 institutes and fulfilling our mission of helping reduce the need for patients to travel abroad for complex, critical care. In addition, we are looking forward to accepting more and more patients. In fact, we recently signed three new agreements with insurance providers; ADNIC's Platinum Health Insurance, AXA's Star Plus network, and select NAS Administration Services (NAS) plans. This is in addition to accepting patients with Thiqa and select Daman Enhanced insurance plans as well as those who wish to self-pay. We also plan to add two more important features to our medical campus, namely training and education and research and innovation. These are our immediate plans. However, our current focus is really to ramp up to our full capacity and better serve patients in the UAE with our complete suite of services, many of which were not previously available here. Then, we will see what the future brings. I believe we have a bright future ahead of us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Bank on Blood]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[bank-on-blood]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Laboratorios DAI developed since it was founded in Venezuela in 1996 and expanded to Colombia, Miami, and Mexico?</h4><p>After I took over the direction of the company, we focused mostly on the blood banking area, which means all the supplies and the services that the blood banks need. In 1996 we opened and we were an immediate success in each of the markets. Since then, we have been expanding to other countries. Practically, we are simply duplicating the business model; we entered Colombia in 2001, and Mexico and 2007. We have been focusing on the blood banking business here in Colombia since 2001 and, since then, the country has become much more economically dynamic.</p><h4>How has your Colombian business developed?</h4><p>We have been very successful here in Colombia—we have approximately 40% of the market in the blood banking area, implementing exactly the same strategy as in Venezuela. We operate on a basis of turnkey business development and we participate in all areas of the blood supply chain. We work closely with hospitals, supplying them with blood for them to process and use in different surgeries. We provide them all the supplies they need to undertake that transformation.</p><h4>From where do you import your products?</h4><p>We have different suppliers, from Asia to the US and from Latin America to Europe. We have suppliers from two or three companies working for us from Spain. There is a company from Germany, which is one of the leaders in this market, and it has different plants in China and Brazil, and so we supply from everywhere. We do sub-distribution from Siemens as well.</p><h4>What impact is the exchange rate having on your operations?</h4><p>It has had a huge impact. This year we are working just to break even, as there has been an almost 50% devaluation of the currency and all the products are imported. The market is not stabilizing as fast as we would like it to. I do not think that anyone expects the pesos to come back to 2,000 anymore, so there is an eminent interest increase and inflation over the coming years. I expect the coming years to be very hard for the economy in terms of battling interest rates and inflation, because the economy also has to adjust. For the past 10 years the pesos was over valued, and the cut in oil prices combined with the strong dollar has created huge devaluation, more so than in any other country except Brazil. This is going go to impact the economy not only this year, but next year as well.</p><h4>With that impact, what are your areas of focus and plans in Colombia?</h4><p>We are an aggressive company and we think that the economy is strong in Colombia. We believe that the fundamentals and the foundation of the economy are strong, which will create more opportunities. We are going to increase sales, invest in the country, and work with the lower margins until the economy stabilizes.</p><h4>Are you planning to diversify your products and services in Colombia?</h4><p>Yes. In 2015 we created a diagnostics area, more for blood banks and laboratory business. We also worked on the retail area in terms of healthcare products, such as glucose meters or blood pressure monitors for pharmacies and wholesalers for drug stores.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the health industry in Colombia for the coming years?</h4><p>It is a very good time to come to Colombia, even though the economy is currently in crisis. With the devaluation, what you get is a smaller payroll and globally reduced incomes, so it is more attractive in some senses. The competitiveness of the workers is a lot higher than it was last year. If you want to invest in an industry, even in the real estate business, now is the time, because it is 50% cheaper in pesos than it was last year.</p><h4>In the long term, do you have any plans to start manufacturing?</h4><p>By the end of 2016, we should have a plant manufacturing reagents for laboratories, and we will also begin private labeling for many of our products. We aim to establish the plant in Colombia. Within three to five years, some 50% of our product portfolio will be privately labeled.</p><h4>Is this move related to the devaluation?</h4><p>It is more related to the simplicity of starting a business in Colombia. For example, Mexico is a big market but it is hard for startups and the government is more bureaucratic, but here they give you more facilities and it is easier for start ups. Now it is not really an issue because with the Pacific Treaty there are no taxes between the countries, so it is the same to manufacture here or there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Do you have plans to bring the ATP tournament back to Thailand in the future?</h4><p>We used to have an ATP tournament, the Thailand Open, for 10 years, where the likes of Nadal, Federer, Djokovic, and Murray, the top four players in the world, would come to play. The tournament did not belong to the organizer in Thailand as it had to be leased. To host the tournament, it needed more sponsors and the organizer made a loss each year. Although there was a financial loss, there was a gain in terms of image for the country. When you think about Thailand, you think of a tourist destination; therefore, if you can bring top sporting players here for televised exhibitions or competitions, it is good PR. The players enjoyed Thailand when they came here and have great comments about the country, the shopping, and the culture. Their experiences were excellent for the promotion of the country and help potential investment. However, during the last two years it became more difficult to get the top players to come and get help from the sponsors; therefore, we stopped the Thailand Open. If we can get the ATP back again we would be very interested. We currently have one ATP level lower than the ATP 250, which is called the ATP challenger 125. The ranking of the players is between 50 and 200, which is good for ASEAN players.</p><h4>You recently brought Nadal and Djokovic to Thailand. What has this done for developing local talent?</h4><p>That was a great success from a sporting perspective. To have the world number one and have two Grand Slam champions playing in Thailand meant bringing the idols of our young tennis players to them. They inspire the junior players that want to grow up to become champions and, in terms of sport, it demonstrates our ability to manage a world-class tennis tournament. It shows that we can manage the light, sound, and television broadcasting in our own stadium. Our stadium was built more than 50 years ago, and we brought it back with Nadal and Djokovic. The world could see that Thailand has excellent infrastructure for sports. In addition to raising the sporting profile of the country, these events were beneficial in terms of PR and confidence. Both of them went to the market and there were many programs showing that Thailand is a prime tourist destination. They visited the Prime Minister at Government House and got to experience all aspects of Thai culture. It proved that sport is not only about sport, but economics, investment, and tourism.</p><h4>To what extent do you think it is necessary for Thailand to have its own sports stars?</h4><p>A decade ago, we had the world's number nine tennis player, Paradorn Srichaphan. After his success, Paradorn became a tennis idol in Thailand. We need a new hero to be an inspiration and idol for sport in Thailand. Thailand now has the chance to build some of the best tennis players in the world. For Asian men, the structure, height, and physique of the upper body tend to be different than their European counterparts. For the ladies, the height and physique is nearly the same; therefore, they are more competitive with Europeans. We have many female junior rising stars in the world top 1,000, and we want to support them as our aim is for them to reach the top 10. They are 14 to 17 years old so now is the crucial age. I believe that Thailand will be successful in terms of women's tennis within the next two years. We are working together with the public companies, corporations, and state enterprise to support these players.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the association and for the sport in 2016?</h4><p>I hope to have more international tournaments in Thailand and to have more international tennis players coming to play in Thailand. I hope that our women players will move to the highest level in the world of tennis. We believe that Thai women have more of an edge than the men in terms of physical structure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Having assumed the office of the President of Latvia in July 2015, what is your outlook on bilateral relations between Latvia and Azerbaijan over your four-year term?</h4><p>Although cooperation between Latvia and Azerbaijan has deepened in recent years, I consider that there is still huge potential for the further expansion of our relations, especially in political, economic, and cultural areas. I strongly believe that new initiatives to enrich our bilateral relations will be started and implemented during my four-year term as the President of Latvia. I am confident that we will continue our contacts at the highest political level. Latvia highly appreciates open and constructive political dialogue with Azerbaijan. The intensity of our dialogue is proven by the fact that our ministers of foreign affairs, economics, welfare, transport, and defence are in contact on a regular basis. Latvia is interested in expanding the cooperation with Azerbaijan in the field of education. We are delighted to see that the number of Azerbaijani students in Latvian universities has increased in recent years, and we hope that this trend will continue. We also have good cooperation between Latvian and Azerbaijani experts at the local government level regarding the issues of healthcare, education, and migration, and we hope to facilitate this cooperation even more. Seasonal direct flights are another important connection that brings our countries closer and increases our people-to-people contacts. Additionally, the Azeri community in Latvia is serving as a bridge between our two states and has become an integral part of the Latvian society.</p><h4>Trade turnover between Latvia and Azerbaijan currently sits at $28 million. What are the main pillars of trade between Latvia and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Active political dialogue at the highest official level and comprehensive legislation in the field of economic cooperation have created preconditions for successful economic growth. Trade statistics in 2014 show a positive trend—the turnover for trade in goods between our countries has increased by 8.8% reaching ‚¬26.57 million, while the turnover for trade in services has reached ‚¬6.33 million. Latvia's major commodity groups for exports to Azerbaijan included livestock and animal production (mainly dairy produce like cream and yogurt, for example), food products (alcoholic beverages and preserved fish), machinery and electrical equipment (centrifuges, monitors and projectors, and telephones), and the chemical industry and its related products (pharmaceuticals) in 2015. Latvia's major services for exports to Azerbaijan are related to computing and information services, financial services, tours, and transport services (rail transport services). The major commodity groups for imports from Azerbaijan included food products (alcoholic beverages above all), and machinery and electrical equipment (mainly telephones), whereas the major services imported from Azerbaijan were transport services (rail transport services above all), other business, and financial services. </p><h4>An Azerbaijani company recently invested ‚¬40 million in the construction of a freight logistics terminal at Riga International Airport. What is the current level of cooperation between the two countries in the transportation sector?</h4><p>Apart from the already existing good cooperation between our countries in the field of transport and logistics, including the planned construction of a cargo terminal at Riga airport, there is still much potential. The container train project ZUBR is one of the best practical examples for our further cooperation in this field. The ZUBR project could serve as a connector of transport systems between the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea. We find that the development of this project into a functioning transport corridor will be made possible with the participation of the Nordic countries and the Black Sea region.</p><h4>What are some areas of future economic growth between Latvia and Azerbaijan?</h4><p>In addition to already existing fields of cooperation, which account for the major volumes of bilateral trade and investments exchange, I would like to add metal processing and machinery, IT, life sciences, healthcare, timber industry, green technology (CleanTech), and the food industry. I consider the promotion of Latvian franchise companies in the fields of cosmetics and fashion, such as Stenders, Dzintars, Madara Cosmetics, Lauma Lingerie, Attirance, and Rosme, in the Azerbaijani market as a promising prospect of economic cooperation.</p><h4>How does Latvia view Azerbaijan as a partner in the South Caucus region?</h4><p>Azerbaijan is an important partner of the EU in the energy and transit sectors. We highly value the role of Azerbaijan in the implementation of the Southern Gas Corridor and the ongoing work on the expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline, the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP), and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). Latvia, as a firm supporter of strengthening the relations between the EU and Azerbaijan, believes that the cooperation in the framework of the Eastern Partnership should be continued. Focusing our work on the implementation of the decisions made at the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga and moving forward with the deepening of the differentiation principle are important. An individual approach should be applied in cooperation with each country, taking into account the level of ambition in each country with regard to its cooperation with the EU. It also requires an update of the legal framework of the EU and Azerbaijan. Enhanced mobility of citizens in a secure and well-managed environment remains a core objective of the Eastern Partnership. Latvia welcomes the progress to date in the implementation of the EU and Azerbaijan Visa Facilitation and Readmission Agreements. Latvia supports the opening of a visa dialogue with Azerbaijan in due course.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the wake of multiple Boko Haram attacks in the region, what can be done to enhance security within the region?</h4><p>The new Nigerian government has done a lot to combat the threat posed by Boko Haram and has essentially put that organization on the retreat. However, we still have to maintain a greater level of vigilance. We have to use the peace building architecture that we have devised and the early warning systems we have already established in our regions and use those mechanisms to protect our citizens. ECOWAS is an integrated region that allows for the free movement of citizens, which creates a greater imperative for national structures to be more effectively integrated. Increasingly, regular communications with one another will naturally promote the sharing of information and provide as much intelligence as possible on request, allowing us to work together to deal with any security challenges that may arise. We currently allow for free movement among member states for a period of three months without a visa or any form of residence requirements. This will change, as we are planning to launch the ECOWAS biometric identity card, which will operate as an identity card, travel document, residence permit, and work permit.</p><h4>What are the key countries you are working with to return to Ghana's 2011-13 GDP growth levels?</h4><p>Our focus is on developing new partnerships to deal with key infrastructure challenges and to increase investment in other growth areas while developing economic opportunities, jobs, and improving the standard of living. We are no longer in a position to take on additional debt to deal with the infrastructure challenges we have, and investments now have to be commercially viable. The focus is on developing PPPs (but not PPPs that are backed with sovereign guarantees) whereby we can assure our investing partner that any funds generated from investments are available to repay any financing facility and create a platform for greater investments in our economy.</p><h4>In which sectors have you identified key opportunities for growth?</h4><p>The number one issue for us right now is energy. We must expand our power generation, improve transmission, have more efficient distribution, and even push our generation capacity in excess of our national demand, as we have the infrastructure to export it. Some of the challenges we are facing right now are due to our infrastructure not being able to keep up with domestic demand, hence the energy sector is the number one area where we would like to attract new investments. Transportation infrastructure and supporting logistics infrastructure are also important. We are looking for partnerships to expand our existing ports and harbors and develop new inland ports, because Ghana is an important transit hub required for trading with our landlocked neighbors. Likewise, we have seen an upswing in the domestic air travel market, and there is potential in that sector as well. The provision of water is also a basic utility that we all need. Dealing with the challenge of waste management is something that every country, city, and municipality has to deal with. We have had some PPP projects that have been interesting, but there is room for more. The government is looking for investments from the private sector in order to deal with the infrastructure deficit we have. The agricultural sector is still Ghana's largest employer, even if it is not our largest contributor to GDP. Our major exports include a mix of non-traditional exports namely fruits, vegetables, and other horticultural products, mainly to the EU. We are restructuring investment programs to make the power sector much more commercially viable. The service sector has been the fastest-growing sector in our economy over the last couple of years and is currently the largest contributor to Ghana's GDP. Our reputation for peace, security, stability, and the state of our infrastructure has attracted a lot of the high-end tourism in the West African region, especially when it comes to conferences, which has created a demand for those services throughout the country. The ICT sector is something that has generated a lot of enthusiasm, especially among our young entrepreneurs. ICT is promising because it is the sector of tomorrow. The sector has been lucrative in Ghana and has been expanding considerably, especially for those that provide solutions to our unique challenges and solutions that can also be replicated across developing countries.</p><h4>Are there plans to expand trade agreements between the EU and Ghana?</h4><p>We have been negotiating EPAs for some time now. We have been negotiating and have finalized a West African partnership agreement with the EU. Under the terms of that agreement, all 15 member states of ECOWAS have to sign that agreement before it comes into effect. Nigeria and the Gambia still have not yet signed on to this agreement, but once they do, it will essentially create a trade agreement between one region and another, which has more potential than a bilateral agreement between our country and the EU. It provides for the liberalization of tariffs from selected imports from the EU over a period of 20 years. We will liberalize our tariffs in five-year periods and we will be eliminating tariffs over a 75% bands, but we are also keeping 25% of the tariff bands where we will not be liberalizing our tariffs at all. That agreement not only continues to give us duty-free, quota-free access to EU markets, but it will also allow us to import not only finished goods, but also components and goods to which we will add value. The EPA will allow us to bring in those things on a duty-free basis, and help us to reduce production costs and allow for adding value domestically to give us competitive advantage.</p><h4>What do you want your legacy to be?</h4><p>As a government, working through the Foreign Ministry, we have tried to ensure that we promote the values and initiatives we believe in, regional integration being an important example. We have a focus on multilateralism and the protection and promotion of universal human rights. We also have a focus on protecting and promoting the rights of women. We have given a greater emphasis to issues affecting gender and social protection in this government, not just nationally, but internationally as well. We have also focused on making sure we reach out to our own diaspora in other parts of the world so that Ghanaians abroad feel that they also have a stake in the progress of our country. We are much more likely to be able to achieve our objectives if we do so in a more integrated world, while at the same time reaching out to our own people and giving them a reason to believe in Ghana, and work with us to achieve our goals. If at the end of my tenure, it can be said that we have achieved any of those things, then I will have achieved my goals and objectives as Minister.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What assets does Central Hospitality International (CHI) typically hold, and how successful has the strategy been?</h4><p>We have 40 hotels in our portfolio; 15 are our own and 25 are managed hotels. In the next couple of years, we will add another 26 hotels, which are currently in the pipeline and will take the total to 66. If you look at the current portfolio, about 75% of our portfolio is in leisure resorts and 25% are set in city locations. When we look at the city product, most of our properties have large meeting and/or convention spaces. We are predominately in that kind of corporate, MICE market in the city hotels, and then our leisure portfolio is typically resorts. We are multi-branded with brands starting from our five-star product all the way through to a newer lifestyle brand. Going forward, we will look to diversify more out of Thailand because we are heavy in terms of our asset here. This will give us more balance in our destinations, which is critical in an industry that is quite cyclical, such as tourism and hospitality. We will continue to invest ourselves and manage additional properties in Thailand as we still see the value of Thailand for growing our business.</p><h4>Speaking of the region, CHI currently manages properties in Vietnam and Indonesia as well. With the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) coming into affect this year, what long-term impact do you think this could have on your strategy?</h4><p>The AEC opens its doors at the beginning of 2016; however, it will take a little bit of time to see any meaningful impact. We have already begun to work on our strategy as it relates to AEC. Aside from the properties we have in Vietnam and Indonesia, we are actively looking for products in the rest of the region. One of the first things we did to cement our position by opening sales offices in each of the AEC markets that we did not previously have. Our sales structure now includes several other locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Philippines, and Indonesia, which serve all of our current products. It was the most important thing to ensure we started to expand the awareness of the brand immediately, because that becomes a more critical path as we become an easier, more accessible market, or a single market similar to Europe. We are part of a larger group, the Central Group of companies, which has expanded quite significantly in Vietnam, and we feel that the hospitality division should be there, too. We have also been actively searching through Myanmar and Cambodia for the right products, and we look regularly in Singapore and Malaysia, but have not yet found the right opportunities. We will continue to drive our growth in Indonesia, expanding on what we already have, and we would like to see a foothold in the Philippines; having said that, we currently have a property under construction in Laos.</p><h4>News broke recently of CHI's planned joint venture with Nakheel from Dubai. Could you tell us more about this project?</h4><p>This move is part of our portfolio expansion, meaning that we have balanced our risk with other destinations outside of Southeast Asia. We identified some time ago key areas that we felt our current customer base would appreciate, and gave us a great opportunity to apply what we do extremely well, leisure holidays. This is an opportunity to open in new destinations and not have to reinvent ourselves as a business, particularly when it comes to finding a customer. The UAE, in general, has a similar customer profile and source market to properties in Thailand, as did the Indian Ocean when we went there, in the Maldives and Sri Lanka. In terms of the project in Dubai, it is on the beachfront on the new Deira Island; one of the new man-made islands, competing with the Palm closer to the city center. The logistics are great, and it is designed to be a more value driven island; therefore, it is going after more of the four-star customers—that is where the growth potential is forged. Holidaymakers want beaches. If you look at the logistics of getting into Dubai, about 1 billion people live within a six-hour flight. Within that segment, there is a huge middle class and trends suggest that the family market is going to be one of the most significant drivers of our industry in the years to come. For us, it was a no brainer; we are going after a four/four-and-a-half-star and family resort, which is well-known in this part of the world. It is a strategic move for CHI to run a joint venture in order to stay in the Middle East market.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead? </h4><p>We will see similar source market business volumes. The number of Chinese visitors will continue to grow and other source markets will stagnate, or maybe even decline. I see that the booking trends continue to change, even for long-distance travel where people have become more comfortable to book at the last minute. We see our booking profile change significantly, and we need to adapt to that and continue to adapt to ensure that our inventory is available and our distribution is there. This particular market in Thailand is fast moving. The inventory continues to grow YoY, and you think that no more hotels can be built; yet, new ones come along and you have to react to that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the first year of operations at the Nacala International Airport?</h4><p>The first year registered low amounts of both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue because only one airline was operating domestic scheduled flights, five times a week. The airport started receiving international traffic in December 2015.</p><h4>The passenger terminal at Nacala International Airport has been awarded with the African property Awards for 2015-16. What characteristics make this infrastructure unique?</h4><p>As this award was for the architects of the building, it seems that the architectural design of the building, and its comfort and functionality, were the most important characteristics being considered. The facility's architecture, design, and localization make this infrastructure unique in Africa.</p><h4>Compared to other countries, the prices for domestic and international flights to and from Mozambique are still quite high. What role does the ADM play in promoting competitiveness in terms of prices?</h4><p>Airport and air navigation charges are regulated and cannot be freely set by the airport companies. Regulation models vary from country to country. Our aeronautical charges compared to other countries in the region are not too high. Landing charges and passenger charges are quite reasonable, for example, but security charges are considered high. The structure of charges differs among airports. ADM plays an important role in promoting competitiveness in terms of prices, and our main strategy is to create incentives for airlines and motivate the introduction of low-cost carriers to our facilities. We recently announced the incentive scheme program to all companies flying to/from Nacala Airport. The incentive scheme has been designed to increase motivation for airlines to start flying to Nacala. We also reduced the charges for the use of passenger boarding bridges at Maputo airport by 15%. We believe we can increase the overall number of passengers of airlines operating scheduled routes to and from Maputo airport to increase attractiveness as well as to motivate airlines to extend their operations. We also have an incentive scheme for the operational fees that apply to airport parking fees, landing, air navigation services, jet fuel, handling, and catering to passengers. It excludes airport security charges (currently shared between ADM, EP, IACM, and KUDUMBA), which are treated appropriately. In order to promote the use of Nacala Airport, we propose reducing the tariffs currently in force. Those tariff reductions include 50% for Nacala routes to Nampula and Pemba and 25% for regional routes like Nacala-Addis Ababa and Nacala-Johannesburg-Nairobi, as well as 25% for domestic routes in the Ponte Aérea da Zona Norte, or Northern Region Airlift, scheme.</p><h4>How do you assess the level of international cargo entering by plane in Mozambique, and will the depreciation of the metical will change trade dynamics?</h4><p>According to the expectations and traffic forecasts of Airports of Mozambique Company, an air traffic increment of about 8.5% is expected in 2016 over 2015 due to the entry of new companies operating at our airports. There are partnering with several economic sectors in order to make efforts to achieve greater synergies and working closely with stakeholders to provide a further push to passengers and cargo traffic. Nacala's cargo terminal has huge potential to boost economic growth. The cargo terminal is located in an economical special trade zone and agrizone and also near a deep-sea port. The port is also set to become the country's premier logistics platform, providing connectivity to several international destinations and access to local distribution networks. Several projects being carried out in Mozambique will provide a strong impetus to the air cargo sector. On the other hand, the focus on agriculture and food security is one of the priorities of the government, as there are clear advantages to agrizone use of the land for the production of high volumes of high quality produce.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>As long as the airport is certified it will work to win more traffic, particularly international routes. The coming year is expected to be one of reforms, with the gas, petrol, and agriculture megaprojects of gas, petrol, coal, and agriculture growing and bringing in increased investment and more exports. The opening of Nacala International Airport and the concentration of international traffic in the north of the country will propitiate a restructuring of flight routes, with more passengers and airline companies flying to Mozambique.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Grupo Rocio?</h4><p>The company was founded in 1967 as a poultry business, a small 2,000-chicken operation in the Northern Peruvian desert. It was a chicken company until 1990 when the constitution was changed to allow investors to own private property on agricultural land. We went to Israel to learn drip irrigation technology and brought it to Peru, where were had been told it was impossible to do agriculture in the desert. This technology along with the tons of chicken manure from our poultry operation enabled agriculture to flourish in the desert. From a four metric ton per year average, we jumped up to 30 metric tons per year with this new technology. We were focused on asparagus until 2005 when we decided to diversify into avocado by bringing technology from Chile and California and adapting it to local conditions. In 2005, we also started raising dairy cattle, and are now the biggest producer of milk in the country. Three years ago we also started cultivating blueberries, and we have become competitive with this crop because we can ship it by boat in 45 days without affecting the quality of the product.</p><h4>Last year, exports of blueberries reached $28 million, a 60% increase from 2013, and Peru is on course to export 17,000 tons of blueberries by 2020. How do you evaluate the potential of this segment?</h4><p>Northern highbushes, the traditional varieties, have been present for 100 years. Southern highbushes are fairly new in the blueberry world, so we are just seeing the first stage of improving evergreen varieties. Northern highbushes have historically been regarded as having better taste, while the commodity variety Biloxi has worked very well in Peru in terms of production cost, though the taste is good but not great. Now new breeders are cultivating varieties with a better taste, a bigger size, and a better quality. Usually a big berry is related to poor quality, which is not true anymore and the new varieties are big, hard, and sweet; and the bigger the berry, the higher the yield. Another factor is that production in Peru does not depend on the climate and we can produce 365 days a year by deciding the pruning time of the bush. We can custom program a plan for every hectare and every retailer, depending on the variety that they want. We can be very predictable in terms of the volume that we can offer and this is very important for the retailers.</p><h4>What markets do you mostly distribute your product to, and where is the biggest potential?</h4><p>The US market is our most important market and accounts for about 65% of exports. The remaining goes to Europe and the UK, which we separate, as they are different markets in terms of volume and quality. Asia is also going to play a very important role in the future. People there are just discovering blueberries, not only in terms of consumption, but also as investors. The computer manufacturer Lenovo has made a major investment in China to grow 1,000 ha of blueberries and to build the country's blueberry distribution channels.</p><h4>How will you capitalize on the recently established FTA between China and Peru?</h4><p>The FTA has been signed but we do not have a sanitary protocol and regulation to export in place yet. We are discussing this issue with the authorities in Peru. There are many import sources that China is considering, but they only allow negotiations of one product per year per country, and blueberries are currently being negotiated. We expect that the market will be opened by the second half of next year or early 2017. It is still unclear what role China will play in our exports, but it could easily reach at least 30% of the market—as big as Europe, or possibly as large as the US in 10 years.</p><h4>How much are you investing in R&amp;D?</h4><p>We have to conduct a significant amount of research on how to adapt market needs to niche products; every company in Peru that is focused on agro exports has to. Blueberries have evolved into a viable commodity, but they started as an R&amp;D project, as did avocados, mangos, grapes, and pomegranates. The industry has learned and matured over time and what was a spontaneous investment in R&amp;D has become a structured and budgeted part of our economy. An ideal scenario is for one or two out of 10 R&amp;D products to become successful products over a five-year research period. The goal is not to follow the market but to be ahead of it, to innovate and try things that have not been done before. We have challenged the industry by bringing blueberries to the desert and we are doing the same with new commodities like peaches and nectarines—stone fruits that were traditionally developed by high latitude countries. Part of our R&amp;D efforts are not only toward planting things in the ground to see how they work, but also having a scouting division. These are people who travel around the world, scouting for new products and genetics to see if something can work here for specific markets, which is how we found peaches. As with berries, we now are adapting and developing technologies to cultivate stone fruits and we already have the first peach and nectarine plants in Peru. We are also pursuing a low-chill cherry variety. R&amp;D is driving Peruvian agriculture right now.</p><h4>What are your main projects and ambitions for 2016?</h4><p>We are working on four different projects, but they are not going to be ready for 2016 or even 2017. We will continue to grow our current divisions in terms of hectares so nothing new will be coming to the market for the next two years. Our target is that in three to four years we will have two or three successful new products.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your recent achievements as a company?</h4><p>Our assets are growing with our standard growth rate. We are present in different industries—telecoms, gold mining, real estate, banking—and due to this diversification, we are stable. That is our management policy. Since divesting some of our mineral resource assets, we have acquired new exploration fields, particularly gold fields. Currently, we do exploration and we expect to increase these reserves. Nonetheless, in the gold fields we operate without a partner so the strategy is based on our existing experience. We also started to work with new opportunities to build a pipeline of projects, and we are looking for new opportunities in the high value-added segment here. For example, we are working on several new investment opportunities, particularly within the wheat and grain processing industry. This is not agricultural per se, but the processing of agricultural goods, otherwise known as agribusiness.</p><h4>What is the international outlook, and what kind of partners are you looking for?</h4><p>Historically, we work with strategic partners that have experience and expertise in a particular industry, such as Ritz Carlton, for example, in the hospitality sector. With our new investment opportunities, we are looking for a professional partner. In terms of sectors, we are currently focusing on production industries. We are not going to do this by ourselves, meaning we are working to attract a professional partner with experience in this segment. In terms of identifying new partners, the obvious step is to determine which companies are leaders in their field. However, the reality is that those giants are not flexible and are quite often conservative so, being a young, flexible company, we are also looking for young, flexible partners. As a first step, we are looking at large global conglomerates, but the second step is that we are also studying other companies to be potential partners. On that level, we see more opportunities.</p><h4>How are the current market conditions affecting the country's diversification program?</h4><p>It is clear that Kazakhstan's economy has suffered because of the low oil and commodity prices. However, the tenge free-float policy, which was recently introduced, helps companies that rely on exports. This move supports local productions and the country's exports across all non-oil sectors. While the tenge was devalued, the beneficial tax regime, which was declared by the president and the government, was not changed. All those benefits and conditions that were announced for foreign investors are still in place and thriving. We are going to continue to use those benefits to build our new plant, for example. So in fact, the current market conditions, prompted by these government initiatives, favor the country's goal to become a sustainable, diversified economy.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company in 2016?</h4><p>Our projections and expectations are strong. Because our portfolio is quite diversified, we were able to absorb the impact of the tenge devaluation in August 2015. Much of this had to do with our preparations and adaptability for all market scenarios. For example, we often stress test our portfolio in case of currency volatility or inflation influx. We didn't necessarily expect such a sudden devaluation, but we were ready nonetheless. The export companies in our portfolio, of course, are benefiting. Some companies have suffered, but cost cutting is the last step for us in any case. We are trying to convince our management to create some new products to develop such solutions that will increase the revenue, despite the devaluation. We want to motivate people despite the cost-cutting initiatives. For example, some of our companies, despite the uneasy world economic situation, have increased in size. They need to support their employees to bring in more revenues and work more effectively. In this sense, maintaining the loyalty of our staff is crucial in the given market conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What benefits will Mediclinic's acquisition of Al Noor bring to the company?</h4><p>The main benefit of the merger is that Mediclinic is known as a quality provider in Dubai and throughout the UAE, and Al Noor is known as a quality provider in Abu Dhabi. We have been growing into Abu Dhabi and opened our first clinics in Al Ain and the Corniche. With the acquisition we will automatically boost our geographical presence across the entire UAE, and hopefully we can combine the two groups to the benefit of the patient, where we take the best practices from both, implementing them throughout, and elevating the standards of care across all of the facilities.</p><h4>Do you expect more consolidation in the healthcare industry?</h4><p>Consolidation is inevitable in healthcare because of the benefit of economies of scale. In the medical insurance market, the more members under the same insurer, the cheaper it is per member, as the risk is spread wider. We are going to see more consolidation in the insurance market, and we are already seeing this in Dubai. Abu Dhabi is a bit different, mainly due to the fact that it is essentially government controlled. There are more good regulations being introduced for operators that will improve quality as well. They want to make sure that billing is ethical and that the service provided is appropriate to the diagnosis. All of that is being driven by an IT system that requires significant resources to manage. The small operators will certainly struggle to be able to survive in such an industry, and that is the same anywhere else in the world. There are also procurement benefits with scale. We obviously get better prices for equipment than a standalone operator would, which was one benefit in taking our operations global. We are in South Africa, the UAE, Switzerland, and we own 29.9% of Spire Healthcare in the UK. We do that to reap the full benefits of global synergy in terms of pricing and best practices.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand regionally?</h4><p>The Al Noor acquisition is a major development. We are doubling the size of this business in terms of revenue, but more than doubling it in terms of staffing. We are going from 2,500 to almost 7,000 staff, and we are going to spend some time consolidating that. We want to grow meaningfully and create shareholder value as well as value for the patients. This will be our focus in 2016.</p><h4>In what areas will you be investing your resources?</h4><p>There will be big innovations in technology in healthcare and we are looking at new hospital information systems. We have just ordered a new laboratory information system. We recently implemented SAP as our back office solutions, and we have to have professional coding systems to accommodate the new government regulations There will be continuous investment in ICT; that is a global phenomenon and it is happening here as well. We do not aspire to be the first in technology; we would rather research and follow the correct technologies that add value, which is one of the reasons we are building the north wing oncology facility, where we are bringing in a linear accelerator.</p><h4>In what area do you identify the most potential for Mediclinic?</h4><p>The barriers of entry into outpatient services are low, whereas the barriers into inpatient services are high. The level of expertise required to provide a proper inpatient facility is significant. However, the country cannot have hospitals on every street corner—it is not viable, so we focus on both. As Dubai is growing in terms of population, we locate primary care facilities in areas where the market is opening up. On the hospital side of things, we are moving more into tertiary care, services that are lacking in the country now, and services that the country will need in the future. Oncology is a prime example of that. The population here is young so there is not a lot of demand for a cancer center, but it will grow because the population is ageing and growing. The cancer center itself is standalone and will not be very profitable at first because patient numbers will be quite low, but we believe that we need to start moving toward more sophisticated healthcare. We have developed trust in the marketplace and the market is ready to trust us to move into more sophisticated healthcare such as oncology.</p><h4>What are your targets for 2016?</h4><p>Our north wing will open in 2Q2016. We have already announced that we bought a piece of land on the southern side of Dubai next to Miracle Gardens for a 188-bed hospital, which is a major project for us. It will cost around $200 million, and will be our main area of growth in Dubai over the next couple of years. That will open at the end of 2018. We will also invest in oncology, diabetes, and obesity. We have started a metabolic center where we have psychologists, dieticians, chefs, endocrinologists, and bariatric surgeons if needed. There are currently 70-80 people in that program. We have started a breast cancer center of excellence, for which we have become well known, though it is becoming difficult to  cope with the volume there and we need more doctors and more equipment, which is part of the motivation for the new north wing. We also started a neurosciences center for neuro surgery and are considering establishing a transplant center with the Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid University to carry out some research as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>With Qatar's five-year National Development Strategy coming to an end in 2016, what have been some of the major end results?</h4><p>While the strategy process and implementation should be seen as continuous and will stretch beyond 2016, many of the major reforms now underway were identified. These include changes in the fiscal process, efforts toward reducing subsidies and increasing efficiency, the introduction of a national health insurance scheme, infrastructure planning, and a national R&amp;D effort. Beneficial outcomes from these efforts are expected in the years ahead. One of the MDPS' most remarkable achievements in 2015 was the Simplified Census of Population, Housing, and Establishments, which was conducted in cooperation with the Ministry of Municipality Urban Planning and intends to provide a proper database to carry out comparisons, projections of demographic data, and the community's social, economic, and urban characteristics. The results of this Census were announced on October 20, 2015, during the celebration of World Statistics Day. That celebration was in line with the request of the UN General Assembly, which adopted October 20, 2015 as World Statistics Day under the slogan “Better Data, Better Lives," emphasizing the importance of statistical data as inputs in the formulation and follow-up of sustainable development strategies in order to achieve the national development goals. One of the other key achievements by MDPS was the election of the State of Qatar as a member of the Statistical Commission and the UN Commission on Population and Development to represent the Asia-Pacific Group for the 2016-2019 term, which came to crown the efforts exerted by Qatar in the fields of statistics, population, and development issues, and the continuous and effective coordination between MDPS and all the concerned parties. This achievement came in recognition by the Asia-Pacific Group of Qatar's role in the development and modernization of statistical systems and the activation of population and development issues at the national, continental, and global levels. Furthermore, MDPS has made great strides in the use of administrative records in statistical process, which will in turn enable MDPS to produce timely, reliable, accurate, and cost-effective statistical data on economic, social, and environmental phenomena. MDPS further follows up on the work of the International Working Group on indicators of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Global Development. As the development and execution of medium and long-term development plans require the provision of timely, reliable, and accurate information and statistics, MDPS continues to assure a quantitative and qualitative leap in statistical products related to data users' needs. Currently, there is an integrated official calendar for all types of statistics that shows clearly the increased frequency and timely pattern of releasing of statistical information compared to what has been the case in the past.</p><h4>How does Qatar formulate broad sweeping plans like the National Development Strategy or the Qatar National Vision 2030 in a way that global macroeconomic forces, like the recent financial crisis or drop in oil prices, do not affect the goals or outcome of these strategies?</h4><p>Of course, it is not possible to predict the future precisely, and all strategies are formulated and implemented under conditions of uncertainty. But in formulating a strategy it is important to identify risk factors and to consider how the strategy can be adapted to changing circumstances. In fact, the National Development Strategy 2011-16 advocated many of the changes that are now in process, at a time when oil prices were high. The newly drafted financial system (2015) is one example. It supports budget reforms and ensures that government spending delivers value for money. But lower oil prices have accentuated the challenges and have given even greater urgency to action, while the core of the strategy is not changed—a core that gives primacy to sustainability and ensures that prosperity today is not bought at the expense of the welfare of future generations. Also, we have taken careful note of the lessons learned from the preparation and implementation of our first National Development strategy, with the midterm review emphasizing the need to link the strategy and budget process much more closely.</p><h4>In what ways does MDPS gauge the success of Qatar's development strategies?</h4><p>MDPS looks at a broad raft of indicators in assessing how the strategy is progressing. Some of these indicators are produced by third parties, such as the World Bank and UN Organizations, while others are the product of the statistical director at MDPS. In the development of the next strategy, one thing that we will be working toward is the creation of a “dashboard" of metrics that will be available to the leadership of the country, and to all ministries and agencies, so that progress can be tracked, and follow-up has been initiated in areas where it is needed.</p><h4>Looking forward, what challenges or obstacles do you foresee in Qatar achieving the objectives of the Qatar National Vision 2030?</h4><p>One of the key challenges facing Qatar National Vision 2030 is to develop the second generation national strategy for the development of Statistics (NSOS), and to provide indicators required for monitoring progress in project implementation and for evaluating project outputs, thus enabling decision makers to propose and introduce necessary interventions in order to creatively achieve NDS goals. In addition, the challenges that were first identified in Qatar National Vision 2030 are still to be fully met. But that is expected, as they are intrinsically long-term development challenges. There are many areas where Qatar will continue to expend efforts to improve and do better—in healthcare and in education outcomes, for example. Fiscally, we need to calibrate our sights conservatively so that we will provide adequate funds for the future. Efforts to support and encourage the private sector to play a larger role in the economy will need to be redoubled. And there is still much to do on the environmental front. But progress is being made and we are learning from our experience so that the pace of progress may accelerate in the future.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>It will be a busy year for MDPS. For much of the year we will be heavily involved in coordination and leading the preparation of the second National Development Strategy 2017-2022. This exercise will be inclusive and will stretch across the whole government and also involve non-government actors in a consultative capacity. The second NDS will provide an opportunity to re-examine what we have achieved, to build on lessons learned from the first strategy and to re-prioritize in the light of new developments.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The US and Kuwait have long been strong ally nations both politically and economically. What is your assessment of US-Kuwaiti bilateral relations currently?</h4><p>The US and Kuwait have a long-standing relationship that pre-dates the US' role in Kuwait's liberation from Iraq 25 years ago. Five generations of Kuwaitis have studied at the university level in the US.  The US and Kuwaiti militaries have worked closely for decades, while our automobiles have been sold here for over 70 years. Currently, Kuwait is a strong ally in supporting efforts to stabilize the region and fight against terror organizations such as ISIL. There are hundreds of US restaurants and retail stores throughout Kuwait. There is great interest in procuring the latest technologies from US companies.  All this means that the bilateral relationship is as strong as it has ever been.</p><h4>Bilateral trade volumes between the two nations exceeded $15 billion in 2014, up 188% from $5.2 billion in 2009. To what do you attribute to this growing interest in the Kuwait market?</h4><p>Kuwaiti citizens have a high level of disposable income. There has always been an interest in US vehicles and that continues to grow, with US fashion and food also of high interest to Kuwaitis.  The US exports a lot in the oil/gas sector as well as in the education sector.  Within the GCC region, only Saudi Arabia sends more students at the university level to the US than any other.  With the globalization of the world's economy and the success US companies have experienced in previous years in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, it is only natural for companies to continue their growth efforts and look to expand to Kuwait as well.</p><h4>Kuwait is the 37th major foreign investor in the US with $1.3 billion and the US is also the largest market for Kuwaiti imports. Which areas of bilateral trade and investment between the U.S. and Kuwait do you identify having the most potential for growth?</h4><p>There are several areas of opportunity for US companies in Kuwait. The number of Kuwaitis that pursue higher education opportunities in the US continues to grow.  There are significant projects in the oil and gas sector as well as in alternative energy as Kuwait seeks to increase its production of renewable energy to cover 15% of Kuwait's electricity needs by 2030. Kuwait's National Development Plan 2015-20 incorporates a number of large infrastructure projects, including plans for airport expansion and construction of a new terminal, the construction of a metro rail system and additional rail projects, a new Kuwait University campus and other educational projects, and the expansion of seven hospitals and construction of two additional new hospitals, among other major developments. In all of these areas, there will be contracts for project managers and consultants, architects and designers, engineers, technical experts, and for firms that can provide human capital training and development programs.  Additional areas of opportunity abound in the automotive, defense, healthcare, information technology, and environmental technology sectors.</p><h4>While Kuwait is currently the fifth largest market for American goods among Arab nations, it is the fastest growing in terms of US exports in the GCC, up 41% in 2014. How can US-Kuwait trade relations be enhanced so that investors and companies may trade and invest with greater ease?</h4><p>While there are many excellent opportunities in Kuwait for US companies, improvement to the regulatory environment would help increase the trade relationship even more.  There has been progress with the implementation of a new law allowing up to 100% foreign owned entities, a new public-private partnership law, and the creation of the National Fund for SME Development that supports SMEs and entrepreneurs in an effort to develop the private sector in Kuwait and diversify its economy.  But more can always be done. According to the World Bank, Kuwait ranks 101st in the world, and sixth in the GCC, in ease of doing business. Reducing the number of steps required to do business in Kuwait would improve efficiencies, lower costs, and increase the already excellent trade relationship between our two countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Panama's social and economic development in recent years?</h4><p>Panama is one of the fastest growing economies in Latin America. Since the Panama Canal was transferred in 1999, the country has been an outstanding performer in terms of economic growth. This has allowed Panama to attract more FDI than perhaps any other country in the region, and has also required the government to invest in and promote more than 100 projects associated with the Canal, including the expansion of airports, roads, bridges, and many other infrastructure projects. These types of developments have helped integrate local companies into global supply chains and financial markets. Compared to other countries in the region, there is great public-private sector collaboration in Panama. The government has enabled an efficient and competitive landscape for the private sector, creating the conditions for companies to invest in Panama. Also, the rise of the middle class, which we have seen in many countries across the region, has been particularly strong in Panama and there has been an overall decline in inequality. In a recent analysis, our colleagues at the World Bank concluded that poverty has decreased over the last decade and, although there are challenges related to indigenous communities and minorities, this growth has been inclusive and can be attributed to all of these infrastructure projects, which created many job opportunities. Inclusive growth has been a major achievement.</p><h4>What impact has the IFC had in Panama?</h4><p>We have been present in Panama for many years and established a permanent office here in 2013, which is now IFC's regional headquarters for our operations in Central America and the Caribbean. IFC has participated in most of the landmark transactions in the country. We supported the expansion of the Panama Canal. Before that, we were present in the privatization of the port sector; we were investors in the Manzanillo International Terminal in Colón. We provided a $300 million financing package for the UEP Penonomé wind power plant, the largest wind project in Central America and the first of its kind in Panama. We are proud of the partnerships we have made over the years in Panama and our clients' ability to have a positive impact on the country's development. Our clients in Panama generate about 3,000 jobs.</p><h4>Why was Panama chosen as the location for your regional headquarters?</h4><p>There are a lot of positive conditions in Panama that attract foreign investment and multinational institutions like the IFC. Many people want to come here because Panamanians are open to foreigners. The connectivity from Tocumen Airport to the rest of the region is the primary advantage of Panama for us. The country is also home to excellent schools and high quality services, so it is attractive for foreign investors and foreign companies to establish offices here. There is a solid financial sector. The UN is also present in Ciudad del Saber.</p><h4>What sectors comprise your portfolio in Panama?</h4><p>Our portfolio in Panama as of November 2015 amounted to $942 million, and that includes $200 million of mobilized funds from partnering banks and other multilateral institutions. The main sectors within this portfolio are infrastructure, with $600 million, and banking, with $290 million as of the end of November 2015—this includes both loans and equity. The main investments in infrastructure are the Panama Canal and the Penonome wind farm. In the banking sector most of our investments are aimed at improving access to finance or supporting the lower to middle-income mortgage market, which is underdeveloped. Other investments are telecoms and education projects. We are on track to grow our portfolio to $1 billion by the end of 2016.</p><h4>Why did the IFC decide to get involved in the UEP Penonomé II project?</h4><p>About 30% of Panama's electricity generation is based on fossil fuels. As Panama's energy needs continue to rise, it must also increase its investments in power generation, particularly in ways that ease the dependence on imported fossil fuels and contribute to a reduction in carbon emissions. That is why we invested in Penonome; to help the country improve its generation matrix and increase renewable generation sources. This 215-MW project is going to produce about 5% of the country's energy generation. We have funded $300 million, including mobilized funds from other banks and investors. We will also continue to support electricity generation projects coming into the energy matrix. We want to be present in all landmark transactions in the country. Through our sister organization, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency or MIGA, we were involved in the Metro Line 1 project. We are looking at the expansion of new ports and are tracking the development of new initiatives in the logistics sector. The banking sector is also one of IFC's core areas of investment. IFC's recent transaction with Banco General is aimed at increasing the availability of mortgages for low- and middle-income individuals, which is where the largest mortgage gap is. Addressing the mortgage sector is important because it has a lot of indirect positive impacts, like stimulating the construction sector, building materials, manufacturing, and job creation. Panama builds 11,000 homes per year, but the need is 12,000-15,000. This deficit occurs primarily in the middle- and lower-income segments, and that is why it is important to revitalize the mortgage lending industry.</p><h4>How can Panama ensure that wealth creation continues to be inclusive?</h4><p>This government is well positioned to increase social investment. That is the reason why they have several interesting programs to increase water supply, electricity supply, and a lot of social and indigenous programs aimed at decreasing poverty in the most vulnerable areas. Our projects will contribute to decreasing poverty in the most vulnerable places in Panama, and our colleagues from the World Bank are focused on participating and advising the government with lending operations to alleviate poverty, especially by increasing access to clean water, as this is one of the main challenges in the poorer communities. The other challenge for Panama and its future growth is the quality of education in regards to the skills gaps. We recently financed the construction of a new Universidad Interamericana campus to provide better facilities and higher-quality education to students from middle- and low-income backgrounds, as well as working adults. We are exploring new opportunities to support the government and the private sector in order to improve the quality and availability of education. One of the areas where there is a skills gap is in Canal-related logistics, so universities are creating specific programs to address that. Education, water, and sanitation are important for Panama, and we would like to be present in them all.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the regulatory framework for investment in Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia has a regulatory framework that favors foreign investment. As you know, Colombia has been an investment destination for some time now. Past and current governments have been very interested in fostering foreign investment and have tried to cut the red tape and help foreign investors in their incorporation process and operations in the country. That has been achieved to a certain extent, but it is a work in progress. However, there have been recent modifications to the tax regime that, in the view of many foreign investors, may affect their future investments in Colombia. This message has been conveyed to the government by several key players and stakeholders, and there is something to be done in that respect. Due to this scenario and international prices of certain commodities, our clients and foreign investors are now cautious about their investments in Colombia, waiting to see how the situation evolves, both tax-wise compared to other Latin American countries and also in terms of the ongoing peace talks with FARC guerillas in Cuba. Under the current global and local circumstances, being cautious makes sense.</p><h4>How would the peace process affect foreign investment in Colombia?</h4><p>It would favor foreign investment, of course. Figures released by the National Planning Department say that foreign investment will triple in the post-conflict decade, that is, 2016 to 2026. Many Colombians agree with the government's position that reaching an agreement in the peace process is a critical factor in boosting foreign investment in the future. Once the agreements are signed in Cuba, Colombian citizens will have the opportunity to decide if those agreements are to be ratified and endorsed and, therefore, if Colombia will finally end its internal 50-year long conflict. It is something to be optimistic about and many foreign governments, including the US, Germany, and the EU have already committed resources to the post-conflict effort, which is very good sign of international support. At the same time, we are all aware of the many challenges the post-conflict era will present and resources have to be managed carefully and well. It is not just a matter of signing the peace document; that's just the starting point for something to come that entails many issues and challenges and requires an important investment.</p><h4>What needs to be done to improve FDI into the oil and mining sectors?</h4><p>Agencies in both the oil and mining sectors are well aware of the many issues involved. Both sectors are very affected due to international prices. Mining in Colombia has been affected for several years now, and the mining agency has to issue and clarify regulations and the environmental licensing processes for the mining companies that are already present in Colombia, and hopefully attract new investors in the mining sector. In the oil and gas sector, the ANH, is considering a new round of bids in order to attract foreign investment. Previous rounds were not as successful as the government expected, so for this new round to be successful, the ANH has to take into consideration the many messages foreign investors and major players have conveyed in the past. If the government wants to attract those major players back to Colombia, conditions have to be well defined and attractive.</p><h4>How do you evaluate legal certainty and the rule of law in Colombia?</h4><p>Legal certainty and rule of law are alive and well in Colombia. We have some of the highest standards in Latin America in this respect. Justice, although slow in countries like ours, is still reliable especially at the higher level. Laws are enforced and, if they are changed, they change with an eye on the future, not retroactively. That provides legal certainty. In the past, foreign companies have entered into legal stability agreements with the government, which shows the clear intention to promote stability and the rule of law. Furthermore, an arbitration procedure can be handled independently and without the interference or influence of the government, other sectors, or third parties. Colombia has adopted a flexible and internationally derived regulation on international arbitration that we believe meets international criteria. In 2012, though not entirely derived from UNCITRAL's Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (Model Law), Colombia's Arbitration Law bears several similarities with the Model Law when dealing with international arbitration. However, we understand that foreign investors may have concerns related to corruption, fairness, and neutrality toward the parties involved. Although Colombia may still be perceived abroad as a country with relatively high indexes of corruption (ranked 94 in the 2014 Transparency International Corruption Perception Index), the Anti-corruption Statute is frequently enforced and there are many politicians, government officers, and entrepreneurs behind bars for corruption-related crimes. It is also important to clarify that arbitrators, although subject to the standards and duties of a judicial agent, are neither employees nor linked whatsoever to the judicial or public branches. This means that a person exercising the role of an arbitrator has to follow extremely high standards of ethics, professional conduct, and diligence as those that are imposed to a Supreme Court magistrate. It is also relevant to mention that Colombia has signed the New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention).</p><h4>What differentiates Norton Rose Fulbright from its competitors?</h4><p>Norton Rose Fulbright was the first truly international law firm to establish an office in Colombia as a result of its global strategy. We clearly seek to differentiate ourselves with our great knowledge and expertise in the industries and sectors in which our clients operate. Knowing how our clients' businesses work and understanding what drives their industries is fundamental to us. Our lawyers share industry knowledge and sector expertise across borders, which enables us to support our clients anywhere in the world. We focus on the six industry sectors where we have the strongest national and international, cross-practice expertise, including financial institutions, energy and infrastructure, mining and commodities, transport, technology and innovation, and life sciences and healthcare. Our reputation has been earned through delivering commercially oriented, leading-edge legal advice to a broad range of clients in this challenging and evolving market. Our commitment to exemplary service and reputation for clear, honest judgment helps our clients achieve results. We not only want to engage and retain the best legal talent in each country we operate but we organize our lawyers according to headlights and industries, so they develop great expertise in the business and operations of their clients. Another difference is our international reach and scope. Not only do we advise clients coming into Colombia or other countries in Latin America, we also offer guidance to clients who are expanding abroad, via our 53 offices worldwide. At the same time, our standards as an international law firm are quite strict and not always met by other law firms in matters such as conflicts and ethical guidelines, partner contact with the client at all times, insurance coverage, and 24/7 responsiveness. We make sure we always meet the most demanding international standards.</p><h4>What are the priorities for Norton Rose Fulbright in Colombia right now?</h4><p>We continuously hold conversations with other members of the legal community and key players in the Colombian market about achieving sustainable growth while maintaining our current ratios of profitability and success. At Norton Rose Fulbright, we always want to hire and retain the best legal talent there is in Colombia and the region. We want to have the same quality and compare ourselves to other law firms not just in Colombia or Latin America but anywhere in the world. We are a London-based global law firm, and that is our standard. We have to continue to provide legal services of worldwide quality.</p><h4>What is your outlook on FDI in Colombia in 2016?</h4><p>I am somewhat optimistic because of the many projects and huge investment in the infrastructure sector. This will greatly help the Colombian economy and FDI in this sector will continue to grow. However, it is justified to be somewhat concerned with many macro economic forecasts for 2016. Next year will hopefully bring a concrete result in the peace talks in Cuba due to the agreed deadline for the peace process, which has taken more time than originally expected and generated uncertainty to foreign investors and our clients for the past three years. At the same time, the government has also discussed and analyzed tax impacts on foreign investment and they seem to be willing to explore possibilities to modify the current tax structure. This will not happen in the short term due to the great pressure of international oil prices on our economy, but the finance officers of the administration know this has to be addressed at some point. Overall FDI has been impacted but it has increased in some specific sectors, and that is also a good sign. Not only Colombia has been affected by the decrease in FDI in the oil and gas and mining sectors; it is a global situation. Colombia's annual growth or GDP will not be as high as some would like it to be, but recent forecasts show it will continue to grow at a rate of around 3%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the BTA Bank acquisition?</h4><p>Kazkom acquired BTA Bank this year, which was a large and complex transition. Every branch in BTA Bank's network has now merged with Kazkom and been rebranded accordingly. We also made the decision to put all the business that we deemed as either non-core or adequately covered by existing Kazkom infrastructure on hold in order to focus on areas of growth within the bank. Since Kazkom is active in retail and lending operations and has no need for a separate mortgage business, the decision was made to spin off and sell BTA Ipoteka.</p><h4>In terms of the current market conditions, what measures has the bank taken to protect its assets from the devaluation of the tenge?</h4><p>There have been numerous results from the tenge devaluation. First, due to the structure of the balance sheet of the entire banking sector of Kazakhstan, the overwhelming majority of retail deposits are in US dollars, which means that these liabilities automatically have increased substantially in terms of local currency across the sector. We are not an exception. There are still loans in dollars, but clients are increasingly borrowing in tenge only because of the exchange rate over the past several months. There is also a major external factor, whereby prices for export commodities are revised based on budget spending, which in turn is tied to the exchange rate. In general, there is more pressure on the margins, and the exchange rate should help exporters and companies that compete with importers given that their costs are in tenge, though we will see within the next six months to what extent that has been sufficient to safeguard against other factors. Regarding protecting the asset base, it would be fair to say that, at the moment, we are lending only in local currency so as to not create a dollar surplus on our balance sheet. We are one of the most active lenders in Kazakhstan at the moment, which comes from a strong liquidity position that Kazkom has had ever since its merger with BTA. Obviously, we are conscious of the potential risks that are arising with respect to our loan portfolio. Another factor to watch is inflation as corrections of the currency exchange rate transform into inflation.</p><h4>Do you have any expectations as to when the currency will stabilize and mature?</h4><p>Historically, the Kazakh tenge and Russian ruble rates have been more or less at parity. Stabilization of the currency is important for clients and for deposits until they start converting their dollar deposits into tenge. Recently, we have seen much higher inflation on the Russian side and Russian importers have also been a lot more active. To what extent and where the exchange rate should allow the producers to regain their market share to take advantage of the Customs Union remains to be seen. That also applies to the oil prices and expectations about the key export commodities.</p><h4>How do your retail operations compare to the corporate side of business and private banking services?</h4><p>Following the merger of BTA's branch network, Kazkom gained a larger presence nationwide. We are not only the biggest lender, but also the biggest bank in terms of the amount of retail deposits in Kazakhstan, the number of ATMs, and number of sales terminals. We have a massive presence in the retail segment now, which we expect to grow. In fact, when Kazkom entered the BTA transaction, the bank's strategic objective was to substantially strengthen its footprint in the retail segment of Kazakhstan. The loans we deposited in Kazakhstan over the last three months were 40% corporate clients, while SME and retail accounted for 30% each. 60% of the new loans came through our new branch network. These figures are encouraging.</p><h4>How important is it for the country to continue attracting FDI, and what sectors have the most potential?</h4><p>Attracting FDI is essential for long-term growth. We are enthusiastic about the decision to create a new financial center in Astana and are looking forward to the development of a legal framework that would allow that to happen. At the moment, investment sentiment is less than it has been in the past, given the export commodity prices. In general, investment flows are decreasing to this part of the world, but that is part of the cycle. From the country's medium-to long-term development point of view, active and well-coordinated work with the investment community is essential. In this sense, Astana's financial center makes perfect sense. Moving forward, we are encouraging investors to look into everything in relation to logistics and trade. There is a growing connection between Europe and China. Since the domestic market is limited due to the fairly small population, the opportunities here are in commodities trading. Kazakhstan has a great strategic position.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the bank in 2016?</h4><p>In 2016, we would expect to complete the transformation of Kazkom. We are finished with the legal part of the merger and we have gained a substantially larger branch network. It is vital that we make this network as efficient as possible and align the product mix in order to adjust to a different network and to increase our product reach. We have made tremendous progress thus far, and we are working to be finished in 2016. Legally and in terms of branding, we have already consolidated our business and we expect to finalize our subsidiary footprint in 2016. A lot of work has been done and regardless of the state of the market it must be completed. The new Kazkom combines the strengths of both institutions, and has emerged as a bank with a solid and diverse product range.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the main objective of your partnership with the Ministry of Education?</h4><p>Our interaction with the Ministry of Education relies on the strengthening of the instructional abilities of the educators to teach STEM. We are specifically focused on science, and later we will move to mathematics. In 2015, more than 680 educators were a part of this initiative to improve their teaching skills in the sciences.</p><h4>How do you promote interest in STEM subjects among students?</h4><p>We coordinate with the Ministry of Education, science clubs, and the National Robotic Competition. SENACYT recently joined the international campaign and educational program called “Hour of Code" to promote computer science nationwide. We also use other tools to promote STEM, such as Scratch, a program developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As part of the science clubs, we organize the National Competition of Chemistry in the Kitchen, which allows students to learn chemical reactions through the art of cooking. There is a lot more to do, and we are now launching an aggressive campaign to move forward in the effort to teach students that science is not something entirely abstract and that technology is in every aspect of their lives. </p><h4>In which sectors do you see technology having the most profound impact?</h4><p>Agriculture contributes 2- 3% of GDP and employs about 17% of the population; yet it is highly unproductive. However, we do not want to be a country that is dependent on agriculture. We just need to satisfy certain areas of production. Making agriculture more technological and scientific will improve the livelihoods of people working in this area, as it will allow them to be more productive and thus more competitive. Another important sector is health, which is my field. We need to have experts who know how to incorporate technology into the healthcare system, but we are still struggling like many other Latin American countries.</p><h4>What needs to be done to promote the commercialization of research and advancements in technology?</h4><p>Panama is still in the early stages. We seem to have gone through a phase of just producing scientific and academic papers, but this is about to change, as the incubators and the entrepreneurial associations are starting to develop. SENACYT is involved in helping the efforts of the Technological University of Panama (UTP) in this regard. Innovation is what we need to work on, and to do that we need to convince ourselves that we can be innovators—that we have talent. In order to be an innovator, a certain level of education is necessary.</p><h4>What are the main pillars of the recently launched National Strategic Plan for Science, Technology, and Innovation 2015-2019?</h4><p>The Plan was approved by the Council of Ministers on January 2015. It is a plan that was developed by different segments of society. It is not only a five-year plan. It now comprises a 25-year policy. We did not develop a plan by area. Instead we have taken a completely different approach and our objective is to use science to support the sustainable development of equity, and central to this goal is health and education. With the funds that we were assigned by the government of the Republic of Panama, we will continue with the development of human capital in fields such as engineering, science, and mathematics, both in primary and secondary schools, but also in advanced degrees at the Master's and PhD level. The pillar of innovation seems to be embedded in a culture that needs to be developed locally, because businesses can get complacent while external competition remains ferocious. Panamanians are beginning to understand that, and we need to constantly remind them that innovation is key. The Plan also focuses on the governance of the whole national system of science, technology and innovation of Panama, because the issue is that it has not been well articulated. SENACYT is also an administrative agency that provides support to the research facilities in different parts of the nation. Science has to be integrated into the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Environment, and even the Ministry of Commerce. What we would eventually like to see is all of the government entities creating an office dedicated to science and technology within their organizational structure. We cannot think that by just giving money to SENACYT, science has already been taken care of.</p><h4>How much does SENACYT give each year in grants?</h4><p>The largest financial support is given through our scholarships abroad, which receive about $15-20 million per year. Financial support for research grants is smaller, at about $3 million. We also organize the National Award of Business Innovation and Seed Capital grants to support the National System of Innovation, which accounts for at least an additional $2 million. These are small compared to what other countries do, but this is new for Panama and it is a good amount relative to the size of the country.</p><h4>Are you planning to expand funding for research?</h4><p>Last year we granted funds to R&amp;D 72 projects. This was a tremendous change, because we had gone through a period in the last two years, with the previous administration, where no projects were funded. The funding varies so much that it is another disadvantage for our country. We plan to regulate funding as we want to support more projects.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We have a plan to increase the number of our community centers that provide free 8nternet access, known as Infoplazas, from 241 to 300. We are expanding and locating the new Infoplazas in remote rural areas. We are creating an alliance with an educational institution that gives high school diplomas via radio and establishing agreements with organizations to add educational content to Infoplazas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The BUA group has interests across the economy. What strategy governs that growth and diversity?</h4><p>Simply put, Nigeria has a population of 180 million people, meaning manufacturing and agriculture are going to play an important role in the country's development. When the company started, we were focused on import and export, but later we moved into flour milling, sugar refining, ports management, real estate development, and cement manufacturing. In 2008 we bought a majority stake in the publicly listed Cement Company of Northern Nigeria (CCNN), which had an old plant that we took over and optimized. We also bought the 500,000 tons per annum Edo Cement Company and developed a 3-million tons per annum greenfield Obu plant. In total, we will have around 10 million tons of cement production in the next two years. For agriculture we have sugar plantations and processing facilities; however, Nigeria still imports over 95% of its sugar needs as raw product. We also have the 50,000-ha Bassa sugar plantation, which is by far the biggest in the country. One of the main challenges for most manufacturing businesses in Nigeria however, is sourcing foreign exchange. With the price of crude oil coming down and the demand for foreign exchange going up, we made a strategic decision to venture into businesses where the sourcing or utilization of foreign exchange is less, and where most of the material needed for production can be sourced locally. This will help create badly needed jobs locally, diversify our business further, and stimulate the Nigerian economy.</p><h4>Last year there was a drop in cement prices by Dangote. How has that changed your business model?</h4><p>Dangote has been blessed in the sense that prior to our scaling up capacity, they were doing businesses with minimal competition, but situations like that do not promote industry efficiency. When we started production, one of their strategies was to bring down prices when the price would have fallen naturally, as there was no reason why cement should be sold at almost twice the cost of production per ton. When we started we reduced the price by about $20 per ton and Dangote dropped their prices further. It did not affect our business model and we will continue to do whatever is necessary, regardless of what Dangote does. The market is big enough for everybody and I would even welcome more investors into the industry. </p><h4>What lines of your business are you looking to push in the future?</h4><p>We are pushing a backward integration program on sugar, which will see us invest heavily in the short-term in bringing our sugar plantations fully on stream. We currently have about 75,000 ha of farmland, which we intend to dedicate to this. We believe this will further reduce the country's dependence on imported raw sugar while supporting the value chain in sugar production within Nigeria. We are also working on several infrastructure development projects in view of Nigeria's huge infrastructural deficit and the commitment of the new government to closing that gap. We expect to almost double our cement production within the next 18 to 36 months.</p><h4>What reforms would you like to see from the new government to help realize Nigeria's potential?</h4><p>We provided inputs into the drafts of the Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan and the Petroleum Industry Bill. The NIRP seeks to increase the contribution of the manufacturing sector to Nigeria's GDP by adding about NGN5 trillion in the next three to five years to annual manufacturing revenues and reduce the country's dependence on oil. Backed by ongoing reforms in key sectors of the economy, especially in the area of energy and power generation, this plan can be achieved. Also, the president has already approved the joint venture companies for NPDC to come together with their partners and corporatize. This is a good thing, but the most important thing is to have transparent and non-corrupt institutions. Once that happens, everything will fall into place. The new cabinet has been inaugurated, so we will soon have a clearer map for reforms. I am hopeful because our government is conscious of the fact that Nigerians are expecting a lot.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Emirates Islamic received an 'A+' rating from Fitch. What does this rating mean for the bank?</h4><p>Emirates Islamic was established in 2004 and over the years, has emerged as the fastest-growing bank in the UAE. The bank has set a good example for the industry by undertaking a journey of transformation over the last four years, extending its reach to significant new customer segments and delivering exceptional performance. The strong performance, marking 15 consecutive quarters of top-line growth, is backed by well-diversified lines of business. The recent 'A+' rating by Fitch places Emirates Islamic among the highest-rated banks in the UAE, reaffirming Emirates Islamic's position as an important bank to the UAE economy and a key contributor to growth not only in the Islamic banking sector but the overall banking sector in the UAE. As Emirates Islamic continues on its growth journey, the rating will increase confidence in the bank, both from investors and depositors. Backed by our strong financials and solid management team, I am confident that Emirates Islamic is poised to take a leadership position in the sector and continue to support Dubai in its aim of becoming the global capital of the Islamic economy.</p><h4>Last year was the “Year of Innovation" in the UAE. What innovations and smart banking services are you offering to your clients?</h4><p>Islamic banking is relatively new, with the first commercial Islamic bank set up only 40 years back. However, in this short span of time, the sector has made rapid advances in the innovation and development of banking products and services and in many cases has outpaced its conventional counterparts. I am proud to say that Emirates Islamic has been at the forefront of this drive to innovation. Innovation is always at the core of all our offerings and we have taken an active role in developing and launching a range of products and services that are trendsetters across the industry. We are committed to fulfilling the vision of the nation's leadership to transform Dubai into a smart city. We have proven repeatedly that we can innovate rapidly to support the economy and the community. In 2014, we partnered with Nasdaq Dubai to launch the Nasdaq Dubai Murabaha Platform, which provides a unique solution for Emirates Islamic as well as other financial institutions and their corporate and individual customers to conduct Islamic financing transactions in a streamlined, flexible, and transparent manner. In less than a year since its launch, the platform has achieved rapid growth, with transactions turnover exceeding AED40 billion. We were the first Islamic bank in the UAE to launch a mobile banking app and the first bank in the Middle East to launch an App on the Windows 8 mobile platform. In 2015, we launched EI trade, the world's first fully-integrated online Islamic trade finance and supply chain platform, offering the bank's corporate and business customers an electronic platform to initiate trade finance transactions, such as LC issuance and amendment, on a secured system available 24/7. At Emirates Islamic, innovation is a never-ending process. We continuously engage with our customers, students from schools and universities, and our employees to generate ideas and suggest innovations that can then be rolled out to the market. Our management teams travel to various countries regularly to learn about the latest developments and technologies, which will have an impact on banking in the future.</p><h4>What are your thoughts about the current regulation supporting Islamic finance?</h4><p>Currently, the banking regulations that support Islamic finance are not sufficient and this is clearly recognized by the Central Bank of the UAE. Further improvements need to be made to legal regulations to support the growth of the industry. In 2015, Islamic banks are expected to continue outpacing conventional banks in annual growth. Many initiatives have been launched over the past to support the industry and I am sure there are many more to come.</p><h4>Emirates Islamic was one of the headline partners of the Global Islamic Economy Summit 2015. What was the outcome of this event and what impact does it have on the development of Dubai as a global Islamic economy?</h4><p>The Islamic economy is thriving across the globe, growing at nearly twice the rate of the global economy, with Muslim consumer spending across sectors exceeding $1.8 trillion. The Islamic travel market, for example, stands today at $142 billion and is expected to be at $233 billion by 2020. Obviously this growth will not be possible without financial and banking support and, as Islamic banks, we will be natural partners in the growth stories of companies operating in the halal industry. At Emirates Islamic, we see the growth of Islamic economy sectors like food, travel, pharmaceuticals, media, and fashion as huge opportunities. We are standing on the edge of a historic opportunity. With a well-defined roadmap and the collective efforts of all parties in the Islamic economy, we can rapidly grow the market. Dubai, in particular, enjoys a unique mix of characteristics that entitles it to claim the right to be capital of the Islamic economy. As an established international business hub with state-of-the-art infrastructure in a strategic location and time zone, Dubai continues to be a magnet for businesses across the world. I am confident that the UAE and Dubai can make a significant impact to the growth of the Islamic economy.</p><h4>During GIES 2015, Emirates Islamic launched the first consumer-focused survey on Islamic Banking in the UAE. What were the major challenges in doing such a research and what were the most interesting findings?</h4><p>As one of the leading Islamic banks in the UAE, we realized that, currently, there is a significant lack of data on one of the most important stakeholders in Islamic banking; the consumer. One of the key enablers to the continued growth of Islamic banking is richer and accurate data reporting on the sector. With this in mind, we launched the first edition of the ISLAMIC BANKING INDEX by EMIRATES ISLAMIC„¢, which will act as a standardized benchmark to help track the key measures around Islamic banking year over year and aim to assist all industry players by informing them on the gaps and perceptions in the market. The launch of the index also marks our continued commitment to the vision of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE Vice President and Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai to make the Emirate the global capital of the Islamic economy. The index analyzed four key indicators; penetration, perception, knowledge, and intention, and creates a benchmark that brings together perception and reality on the status of the Islamic banking industry in UAE. The index reveals more than just the attitudes and opinions of people in the UAE towards Islamic Banking. It also creates a pathway to the solutions that will enable us to drive the continued growth of Islamic banking in the UAE. Three out of four people in the UAE are willing to consider using an Islamic banking product, clearly marking an opportunity for the industry as we continue on our path to become the global center of the Islamic economy. Trust, fairness, and community responsibility are core pillars of the Islamic banking proposition and clearly people associate with that. Yet, the same consumers also want the best products, technology, and service, which will drive us to continue on our journey of launching more innovations going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Ahlibank's performance over the last year?</h4><p>It was an excellent year for the Bank on all fronts. In terms of performance, we have recorded strong operating and net income growth, even after allocating access provisions to protect us against future unforeseen loan losses. And on the strategic level, we have completed our rebranding, major technology investments, and taken steps to address the Bank's liability structure, leading us toward early compliance with both new prudent funding and Basel III rules.</p><h4>Recently, Ahlibank signed its first syndicated loan, worth $200 million over three years. What is the significance of this deal to the overall operations of Ahlibank?</h4><p>The size of the syndicated facility was not our aim. There are several milestones that can be highlighted with this debut facility: feasibility, an improved maturity ladder with long-term funding representing 6% of our 2014 balance sheet, commitment and trust of major regional and international investors in Ahlibank, and last but not least the profile of Qatar as a haven for investments.</p><h4>How open is Ahlibank to partnering and collaborating with other regional and international banks on similar agreements?</h4><p>Following the successful closure of an oversubscribed loan facility, we have set a benchmark for future arrangements if required, such as a syndicated loan structure, MTN, Tier I, or bilateral arrangements. We will decide what is appropriate at the right time. Our Tier I adequacy ratio is currently 16.9%.</p><h4>Fitch Ratings has recently upgraded Ahlibank's IDR and SRF from A to A+. What does this mean to Ahlibank going forward and how does this reflect the strength Qatar's banking sector as a whole?</h4><p>The recent rating upgrade has placed Ahlibank on an equal footing with the other major banking players in Qatar. This is a true recognition of the bank's strong position on all fronts.</p><h4>What is your expectation for the year ahead?</h4><p>The operating environment in 2015 was different than 2014 and beyond. Hydrocarbon prices have declined by 50%. Therefore, we must set realistic expectations on final results. We believe in prudence and long-term sustainability against short-term gains.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your investment philosophy at Gatehouse?</h4><p>We call ourselves a merchant bank, meaning that we are partners with our clients. Our investment philosophy is focused on the needs of clients in this region. Historically, they have invested with big, well-known investment banks, but these firms have been going through strategic changes. Additionally, the regulatory environment has evolved, which has impacted the industry. We realized many Gulf-based firms were employing an ineffective model, namely that having someone in an office who has never known a market, structuring a product, and having relationship managers selling that product without understanding it was not working. I wanted people on the ground defining what we and our clients want and need. With our teams, we specifically design our products to fit the investment goals and objectives of our clients, focusing on global diversification and wealth preservation in real estate. With investment teams and capabilities in the US and UK, Gatehouse is the bridge that is opening up these markets to our clients. For nearly a decade, we have defined a new way of thinking for clients and the market.</p><h4>What are some of the recent successes you have had at Gatehouse?</h4><p>We constantly innovate and we take a pioneering approach to finding value in real estate markets. Coming out of the financial crisis, we were deploying capital across a range of single-tenant, income-producing assets when many were too afraid to invest. We employed this strategy in the US and the UK, where we saw increased economic growth and corporate balance sheets improving. This had a positive effect on both the office and industrial real estate markets, among others. Today, our thesis has proved correct, having successfully exited a number of these investments. In student housing, which today is a popular asset class with institutions, we were among the first to enter the sector in the UK and the US. We then looked at single-family residential assets in the US. Many of these assets were held by banks due to the mortgage crisis. Due to the valuations we were seeing, combined with our view toward economic, job, and rent growth, we became heavily involved in the sector during the 2013-14 period. Today, we own approximately 1,800 homes across multiple growth markets; these assets are providing strong current income for our investors. Building upon this, we looked for similar opportunities in the UK. While the private rented market differs in the UK relative to the US, we saw that there was a significant supply-demand imbalance in the UK market. From here, we focused our attention on the private rented sector (PRS), which is quickly becoming an emerging asset class in its own right due to its underlying fundamentals. There is a shortage of private, affordable housing in the UK and, as a result, there is significant government support for the PRS sector. Our first move into PRS was a £110 million investment to develop and let over 900 homes in northern England. Following the success of this investment, we launched a new initiative to develop thousands of homes across the UK on a much larger scale. We are proud that this initiative has the backing of the sovereign wealth fund of Kuwait. This is a great example of Gatehouse taking a leadership position in the markets in which we operate. However, being aware of what clients want and need is really the secret to our success.</p><h4>What trends drive your focus on real estate investments?</h4><p>Over the last 10 years, we have seen a focus on wealth preservation with a desire to be invested in major international cities, such as London, New York, Washington, or Los Angeles. Investors view these as safe havens for investment; we believe that real estate is an asset class that can sustain value in the face of the deepest of crises and credit crunches. Prudent strategies, focused on value creation and replacement cost, are things that we believe drive good real estate investment. Real estate is also something that clients can understand as you can generally define your risk and reward based on history and clear data. One of the reasons we invest in the UK and US is their level of transparency. This does not mean the value will always go up, but at least we can define risks and develop strategies to mitigate the value of going down.</p><h4>Kuwait, through its sovereign wealth fund, investment companies, and the investments of private individuals, is known as the leader in the region in terms of investment outflows. What do you think is needed in order to bring some of this investment into Kuwait?</h4><p>It comes down to the rule of law. We choose the US and the UK for our investment activities because we can define and understand what our legal rights are in those jurisdictions. Global investors need clear local laws and transparency. An investor does not want to be in a market where they may run into problems if they want to liquidate assets or move money. That being said, Kuwait is a sophisticated market in terms of liquidity with the potential to be a leading frontier market with global exposure. However, Kuwaitis tend to feel that they should be the ones investing in their country. This is different from the attitude in other GCC states where they are heavily promoting foreign capital investment. If there is a project in Kuwait that global companies want to fund or be part of, Kuwaiti companies tend to want to do it themselves. This is a cultural mentality, and I do not blame local companies for seizing these opportunities when they have the liquidity. In recent years, Kuwait has been trying to encourage more foreign investment by introducing new foreign capital regulations and tax incentives. Kuwait needs to be more welcoming and clearer from a legal perspective and also refine the bureaucratic process required to get things done. In terms of sectors, oil has been the focus for a lot of global investment in the region, but there are other attractive opportunities for investors to consider. It is interesting to note that about 70% of the population in Kuwait is under the age of 35. Kuwaitis also have significant spending power. As a result, Kuwait is a great market for the retail and food sectors, as well as other sectors for investment that could focus on the potential of the consumer demographic.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>The geopolitical issues the world is facing are concerning for any investor. Markets never react well to uncertainty, and volatility over the course of the year is expected. The recent interest rate hike we saw in the US was a good message for investors, as we have not seen a rate rise since 2006. We think that the low interest rate environment has led to some income-generating assets being overvalued; this includes some real estate. For this reason, we have exited a number of investments over the past two years. Our bank is now focusing more on lending. This demonstrates that we are still comfortable with real estate, but we are cautious. Looking at regional markets, their performance is affected by the low oil prices and we have seen this already with the stock exchanges. It could be a bumpy ride ahead. The anxiety within the regional markets is good for us, as investors will want to diversify and move money to safe havens, and we can benefit from this. My concern for 2016 is increased levels of volatility and a general correction of asset prices. However, bear in mind that companies and banks are healthier than they were a decade ago and the regulations are getting stronger. Nevertheless, in this environment, there will be markets that suffer and those that do not. Our view is that safe havens will retain or even gain value as volatility causes a flight to safety by investors. We hope for more stability on a global level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[fundamental-steps]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>On September 8 2015, President Nyusi inaugurated the continent's largest plant nursery. How significant is this project for Mozambique and for the group's overall activity?</h4><p>This infrastructure represents a fundamental step in the evolution and implementation of this project. We have a planting program that is aggressive and is presently being ramped up. For this reason, we need the right infrastructure to produce the number of plants we need and at the quality that we expect. Ultimately this facility will be able to produce between 12 and 14 million plants a year. This production will be complemented with satellite nurseries that will be much smaller in terms of production. This will allow us to manage the risks of concentrating too much on one area. Diseases and pests can adversely affect production. It also allows for a more even spread of employment, which will work out better for the locals. We are working across a large area, and we want to distribute this wealth as widely as possible.</p><h4>How will Portucel's nursery contribute to the local economy?</h4><p>The impact will be enormous. In macroeconomic terms, exports will increase significantly. According to current prices, production will contribute $1 billion to annual exports. Compared to the current total exports, that increase would stand at between 25-30%. Internal added value will be huge, which means a stronger contribution to the quality of life of local families in areas where the project is based. The resulting inflow of foreign currency is also of major importance, contributing to exchange rate stability, which will make a fundamental contribution to the control over inflation. This is the kind of matter that we look at carefully when investing somewhere. There are direct consequences for families, mainly through employment. At the cruise speed of the project, we may reach 7,000 permanent direct jobs. These are the main indicators of the tremendous impact this project will have, locally and nationally. Our mosaic approach to landscape management involves a combination of various economic, social, and environmental components. As a result, we have been able to manage a large area we got from the government without any physical or economic displacement, which are two problems we tried to avoid. Our first priority is to guarantee that livelihoods will be preserved, and the second thing is to improve them. That is why we have designed a social development plan that will invest around $40 million over the course of the next seven years to work toward preserving people's livelihoods and improve food security. In some places more than 40% of crops are lost due to bad storage conditions. Also, the One Community, One Forest program will provide opportunities not only to preserve some natural areas where products and services and essential for livelihoods, but also to plant eucalyptus that they can be used for firewood, construction materials, or for pulp processing. We also help to develop SMEs for the provision of services to the forestry segment, as well as a growing scheme to produce wood for mills. We encourage agri-business value chains to sustain production increases for farmers and their communities. The third pillar is about quality of life, where education and health are the main concerns, and also some infrastructure. For instance, improving the quality of schools and providing housing for teachers, sanitation, water supply, and other crucial facilities. Due to programs in these three different areas, we are convinced that economic displacement will be totally avoided and we believe there will be an improvement in the quality of lives. A fourth area where we are working is empowering communities to manage activities and assets that will be implemented through the social development plan. This is something that is new to Mozambique.</p><h4>What partnerships is Portucel considering to strengthen its operations?</h4><p>We already have a partnership with the IFC World Bank group, and they control a 20% share of the company's capital. We are looking for another potential partner, and in the future are thinking about working with Mozambican partners, either national companies or private families. Sooner or later the idea is to enter the stock market and offer Mozambicans the opportunity to own the company.</p><h4>What is your medium-term outlook for the Mozambican economy?</h4><p>Any economy should be diversified as much as possible. This is the correct strategy, and we fully agree with the approach that the president is taking. We are happy to invest in such long-term projects because we believe in the country. We realize that there may be crises in which necessitate taking a step back before we can move forward. Difficult situations will arise, but long-term prospects are positive. We are convinced that the country will continue evolving and moving forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[float-like-a-power-station]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Karpowership secure the agreement with Ghana's Ministry of Power to supply the country with two 225 MW Powerships?</h4><p>Ghana suffers persistent and unpredictable shortages in power supply, which the locals call dumsor. The Ministry of Power was looking for a medium-term, fast-track solution to bridge this gap between demand and capacity. Karpowership's Powerships have the advantage of being quickly deployed. This is an ideal solution for the current power deficit, staving off the negative social or economic impact that power shortages would otherwise have on the country.  The first Powership is located in Tema, while the other will go to either Sekondi or Ofosu.</p><h4>What kind of infrastructure do you need for your ships to be able to operate here?</h4><p>The main advantage of a Powership is its self-sufficiency. The Powerhips contain a full power plant, including the substation, which is unique among most of the rapidly deployed generation assets. The only infrastructural constraint is the transmission to land capability. Ghana has fairly robust infrastructure in this sense, not having suffered from a lack of investment or maintenance. Our transmission lines at the Tema site are already completed and in place, so the project will be operational within a few weeks of the Powership's arrival. The second Powership is expected to be delivered in the 2H2016.</p><h4>What role have your partners played in Ghana and how is your relationship with them?</h4><p>All of our stakeholders have been supportive and welcoming. The Ministry of Power has been helpful as our off-taker. This kind of relationship is a first for Ghana and also a first for Karpowership. There is always a learning curve in new partnerships, particularly when using a business model such as ours that many people do not yet understand. It is understandably difficult to grasp the concept of the Powerships without first seeing them in operation. The project will get a lot more support and understanding once Karadeniz Powership Aysegul Sultan begins functioning as a power station.</p><h4>How big are these Powerships and how long will they be deployed in Ghana?</h4><p>A Powership is about the size of a football pitch. A 225-MW power plant would require one and a half times that space. We have signed an agreement to work with the Ministry of Power for 10 years, which is a standard duration for medium-term projects. Most independent power producers (IPPs) work under 20-30 year contracts. As the portfolio in Ghana develops and as the government realizes its vision over the next 10 years, bringing in a 20,000-MW coal plant with an additional 1,200 MW from other stations, the Powerships will be uniquely positioned. When the Powerships are no longer needed, we can move our assets elsewhere. Implementation is often slow on projects like these, so contracts like ours are commonly extended, which is a possibility for us as well.</p><h4>What fuel do your plants use?</h4><p>Our engines can run on heavy fuel oil (HFO) and natural gas. This is a game changer for Africa, because HFO is not an option that is widely available in West Africa. HFO is cheaper than diesel and natural gas, so it offers a potential advantage in savings. Half of the price of electricity goes toward fueling the costs of operating a power plant. Significant savings can be achieved by using HFO, which can then be passed on to the Ghanaian consumer. In terms of price differentials, the spreads have actually increased over time, but right now there is about a 30% discount with HFO.</p><h4>Will Karpowership extend its presence throughout the region beyond Ghana?</h4><p>This is a part of our plan. We provide utility scale solutions, and the Powerships have the flexibility to be quickly deployed, making our value propositions a plug-in-and-play scenario. There is a shortage of affordable power in West Africa, as is the case throughout most of the continent. Karpowership's Powerships offer at least a partial solution to those challenges. Our strategy in West Africa is to make Ghana our power hub. Ghana is the sweet spot in this region and it offers easy access to other countries such as Cote D'Ivoire, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Mali, and Burkina Faso. This is a major advantage, especially given the overall business environment and stability here. We expect to add more megawatts to our production capacity in Ghana over the next couple of years. West African economies are growing fast and they will need access to quick power before they can develop their own energy infrastructure. Ghana has the connections and grid strength to get things done from this country all the way to Nigeria to the east and Burkina Faso to the north.</p><h4>Given the global potential of your business model, where will your fleet be deployed next?</h4><p>Once we bring in our new 235 MW Karadeniz Powership Aysegul Sultan, our fleet capacity will exceed 1,500 MW. We are projecting to double our current size in 2016, and perhaps triple it by 2018. As of now, we have Powerships throughout Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. We anticipate that markets in Central and South America may soon call on Powership services as well. The Powerships were designed in accordance with our founders' “one world" philosophy to improve living conditions for people all over the world. Through Powerships, we can bring what people need wherever and whenever it is needed.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>There is a lot of potential for further business opportunities in Africa due to widespread deficiencies in generation. We will continue to look into those markets and make headway. We are always looking for partners, and ideally we will work with a local partner in whichever market we enter.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where does Ç¼LEX fit in the Nigerian market?</h4><p>Ç¼LEX is a full-service commercial and litigation law firm. We have offices in four locations in West Africa; three in Nigeria, and one in Ghana. Our Nigerian offices are in Lagos, Abuja, and Port Harcourt, and the Ghana office is in Accra. We aim to serve large corporates. That is our main client type, and our service offering covers most of the things they would need, be it advice on entry into the country, setting up a company, the structure of the company, licensing, immigration, tax, and building permits. We handle everything involved in having and operating a business. Once their business is up and running, they would also need our services for labor and litigation issues. Once a business is thriving in Nigeria, every government entity wants to find it at fault, be it for taxes, licensing, or even traffic offenses; they will come after businesses. Therefore, we help our clients manage these issues and help them find solutions to problems. </p><h4>What do foreign investors and big corporates need to know about Nigeria today since the election took place?</h4><p>Not much has changed yet, because Nigeria's needs have not changed. The infrastructure deficits we had a year ago have not gone away. Electricity is still scarce. We produce 5,000MW, but we probably need between 50,000 and 100,000MW. We could build power stations all my life and we still would not have enough. We need roads. We need seaports. The biggest seaport in Lagos is congested and getting goods through it is a nightmare; therefore, more ports are needed. Rail transportation is insufficient. None of this has changed. Airports are the only area where we may have what we need, but then again a recent report found Lagos and Port Harcourt airports to be among the worst airports in Africa. Even though we have a large airport in Lagos, it does not work well and it is not inviting. All in all, there is a lot of work to be done in Nigeria and that has yet to change. The obvious challenge that the new government faces is that of figuring out how to get things done. That was also the challenge the previous administration faced, but it seems the voting public decided the outgoing leadership did not have the wherewithal to do what was needed. Hence, there is a new team in place. They have only just appointed ministers recently despite the fact that months have passed since the elections. The new ministers appear to be mostly private sector appointees, which is perhaps a good thing since they may be thinking more about getting things done in contrast to the party faithful who may have the next elections and their own positions in mind instead of getting the job done. The current cabinet will have a better understanding of the problems and have better idea of how to get those problems resolved.</p><h4>What do you consider the most significant legal and fiscal barriers to investment in Nigeria today?</h4><p>There are not many fiscal barriers in Nigeria. Corporate tax rates are 30%, with an extra 2% education tax, so that is 32% in total, which is not too high. Many countries have higher corporate tax rates than that, and they still get FDI; therefore, there are no serious fiscal barriers to doing business here. The problem is the daily challenges of getting business done in Nigeria. The regulatory framework for doing business is slow. Whereas in other countries it may take two or three years to get a project or a business up and running, in Nigeria that could easily take up to six or seven years. That is a problem. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Taxation has become an increasingly important issue in Nigeria and will likely be collected more aggressively in 2016. What is your advice to firms on Nigeria's new tax enforcement?</h4><p>Governments and tax authorities around the world (including Nigeria) are beginning to pay greater attention to how organizations manage their tax affairs and are demanding greater transparency in tax compliance processes. In fact, different directives, regulations, and action points that all require greater disclosures and reporting of related-party transactions, with the aim of reducing perceived base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), are being agreed upon at global scale. In view of the above, firms need to realize that the management of their Nigerian tax affairs can no longer be business as usual. They need to know that tax authorities will be more aggressive and sophisticated in 2016. Consequently, taxpayers need to make conscious and strategic efforts toward increased tax compliance and management. In short, they need to make taxes a boardroom agenda. This will ensure that they assess their tax risks and processes, just like other risks facing their business, develop effective tax strategies that align with and support their overall business objectives, and determine whether their tax departments (and tax consultants) are fit-for-purpose. Going forward, we should expect tax authorities to impose more sanctions on tax defaulters. Thus, taxpayers need to ensure that their tax departments and consultants file tax returns, pay taxes due, and respond to letters and assessment notices from tax authorities on time. Otherwise, they would be exposed to avoidable tax liabilities and reputational risk. Firms also need to know that tax authorities will 'go for the kill' during tax and transfer pricing audits in 2016 and in future years, in a bid to shore up tax collection. Thus, the need for taxpayers to keep proper records, and use competent tax consultants especially during tax audit exercises, cannot be overemphasized. Lastly, firms need to be proactive in managing their tax affairs. They need to proactively review their structures in view of the imminent implementation of the BEPS action points being spearheaded by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). They need to evaluate, for example, what the proposed implementation of the destination principle for value-added tax collection on e-commerce transactions would mean for their business. Someone needs to be asking: “Are we ready for the introduction of thin capitalization rules in Nigeria?" “How would the introduction of controlled foreign company rules or anti-fragmentation rules affect our current ownership and operating structures?"</p><h4>How is KPMG contributing to transparency at all levels of the economy, and how would you advise firms to be more transparent in their operations?</h4><p>KPMG in Nigeria ensures that it remains transparent in all its dealings with clients—both public and private. We have strong business principles and we believe that organizations must do things ethically and transparently. We are an ethics-driven firm and believe that it is the key to being transparent. The way we work and the type of clients we work for attest to our strong principles of being transparent. We have a client acceptance procedure that makes us choose our clients carefully, following due process. We are an organization that complies with requirements of regulations, acts, and policies that govern our business. KPMG in Nigeria contributes to transparency at all levels of the economy from our financial audit statements, which increase stakeholders' confidence in the businesses that we audit. Recently, Kunle Elebute, Partner and Head, Advisory Services, KPMG in Nigeria was appointed member of the Steering Committee of the Efficiency Unit for the Ministry of Finance, to ensure effective management of Nigeria's economy in order to reduce cost of governance. This is testimony to the fact that we have a proven track record of integrity and transparency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry of Culture promoting Thai films outside of the country?</h4><p>The Thai government has placed a huge importance on the film industry because it increases revenues for the country, while also boosting tourist numbers and the image of Thailand abroad. We also have the National Board of Film, which is chaired by Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha, and it aims to be one of the world's most famous locations for film productions as well as promoting the Thai film industry both locally and abroad. We have produced more than 746 films in Thailand, generating about $35 million in 2014. Apart from film production, we also promote post-production and we have been present in many world famous film festivals, like Cannes, Tokyo, and Shanghai to promote the concept of Thai films.</p><h4>Earlier this year you were involved in a campaign to encourage Thai citizens to wear more traditional clothing. How important is this to preserve national identity?</h4><p>It is very important. Miss Thailand has been awarded the best national costume in the Miss Universe competition five times, which is why we are proud. Thai silk is a great product; we have high-quality material and designs. There have been many developments and evolutions over hundreds of years in traditional Thai clothing. Jewelry designers in Thailand are also very famous. Queen Sirikit supports Thai dress and textiles, especially traditional and authentic dress for boosting the income of local communities. We have heritage day every Tuesday, when we promote Thai dress for officials to wear across the country. This is symbolic and not compulsory, but by dressing in our traditional attire—at least once a week—we show that we are serious about preserving our national identity.</p><h4>How is Thai culture defining itself in the context of globalization?</h4><p>Thai culture is especially dynamic because Thai people are able to adapt to the quickly changing world. We assimilate into new cultures and we can easily and effectively adjust ourselves, which is how we are able to thrive in the modern era. We maintain the best aspects of foreign cultures and adjust them to suit our own. Cultures around the world are changing by the day and we are playing a part in developing them. Thai people must know that there are traditions that we need to preserve, but that we must also adjust into a new way of life. For example, with our cuisine, perhaps it is no longer possible to prepare food using traditional Thai methods of cooking, but we try to maintain the taste as it was in the past. We want Thai children to be aware off Thai-ness and also to be aware of the modern world at the same time. We want them to strike a balance between old and new and to recognize, as we do, that the world is changing.</p><h4>What role does culture play in bringing in tourism revenues for the country?</h4><p>We expect that we will have around 30 million visitors to Thailand in 2015, which will generate around THB2.2 billion. Tourists are not only attracted to natural places like beaches or mountains, but also visit cultural attractions. Historic buildings, towns, or museums play a big part in tourists' agenda when visiting Thailand. The Ministry of Culture proudly manages our museums, historic parks, World Heritage temples, as well as festivals. We expect that this year there will be 8.2 million visitors to the World Heritage sites and museums in the country. We recently launched a tourist application, which introduced QR codes to museums to offer an easier and smarter experience for visitors at museums, and also audio guides. We expect the number of visitors will increase from 5 million to 8 million this year with the promotion and marketing of the application.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our goal is to prepare for the ASEAN community; we have established the ASEAN Cultural Center this year to promote the understanding of ASEAN in Thailand. We expect participation from the private sector, as we have introduced incentives such as a tax deductible campaign if private entities donate to cultural organizations or agencies. We also promote and provide support for folk artists and performers to help them succeed in the modern era, by generating more jobs for them. We collaborate with other agencies, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Tourism and Sports, and also the Ministry of ICT. When we promote Thailand globally, it has to be a joint effort. For the promotion of culture, we are going to do it not only in ASEAN, but across Asia, Europe, and Africa, and even in South America. We have to all work together on this but it is the duty of this Ministry to inspire people to love our culture and our values.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did entering the market in 2007 fit in with the bank's global strategy, and how does operating here compare to other financial centers?</h4><p>Emerging markets, from Asia to Latin America, are key to the global growth of Credit Suisse and Panama. Because of its key geographic position and talented workforce, it is a natural hub for the region. From here we can easily reach Colombia, Venezuela, and other countries in Central America thanks to the well-developed transport infrastructure. Our main activity in Panama is private banking for ultra-high net-worth individuals who have liquid wealth in excess of $50 million. These are clients to which we can deliver the value-added services of our investment bank. This allows us to serve our clients' individual and corporate needs. I saw this work well when I was in Singapore; Credit Suisse is truly a global bank and this is what makes me passionate about working for it.</p><h4>Credit Suisse is known throughout the world for its integrated banking business model. How well does this apply in Panama and the surrounding region?</h4><p>Credit Suisse's integrated banking model means that investment banking works together with private banking. This does not apply so much to Panama, because our operations here are largely focused on private banking, but in other locations such as Colombia there is great synergy with investment banking, which fits into our strategy.</p><h4>The bank inaugurated its new offices in Costa del Este last year. How else is Credit Suisse consolidating its presence in Panama?</h4><p>Costa del Este is the place to grow in Panama right now and Panama is ideally located to expand our exposure in Latin America in terms of both clients and important markets. We're in a sweet spot in terms of regional time zones as well.</p><h4>Where else has Credit Suisse expanded its operations since 2007?</h4><p>We have representative offices in Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well as an advisory office similar to this one in Chile. What we currently cover from here in addition to Panama is mainly Colombia, Central America, and parts of Venezuela and Ecuador.</p><h4>Looking ahead, do you envisage further reforms in the local banking sector?</h4><p>I am sure there will be. A delegation recently signed the OECD 26 Automatic Exchange of Information Agreement, which will come into effect in Panama beginning in 2018. Other countries will start sooner; Switzerland will adopt the accord in 2016. Our industry is completely changing right now, and recent reforms will benefit the sector in the long term.</p><h4>What are your goals and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We see tremendous growth opportunities in the region and we are here to stay. We expect to expand in Panama and Colombia in the near term, and probably in Venezuela in the medium term. Central America also presents opportunities that are best served from Panama as a regional hub. We are extremely confident about the sector; wealth is growing in Latin America and our industry is changing and, with our integrated banking model, Credit Suisse is ideally positioned to serve our existing and future clients. With its political stability, strong labor force, and the well-developed infrastructure, Panama is the ideal place for us to be.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How large is your manufacturing footprint in Nigeria? </h4><p>GSK started basic manufacturing in the 1970s with a facility dedicated to the manufacturing and packaging of over-the-counter medicines. Our current arrangement is such that we collaborate with contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to make the most basic products in our portfolio, while other products (especially ethical products) are imported.   Our aspiration has always been to manufacture products locally and, following a recently held global business review, we now have the approval to set up an antibiotics factory in Nigeria.  </p><h4>What are GSK's expectations for patterns of consumption?</h4><p>We want to expand into the future of Nigeria. The country has a population of 170 million, with 70% living below the poverty line. Many Nigerians live on a daily wage of about $2 per day. With $2 they need to cater for their needs such as shelter, healthcare, nutrition and transportation.  As a company, we are committed to expanding access to a greater percentage of the population, bearing in mind that people who earn $2 per day should be able to access our products. One of our key philosophies is to provide access to medicines by actively seeking new ways of delivering healthcare and making our products more available and affordable to people who need them, wherever they live and their ability to pay.  With this in mind, our aspiration is to expand access to 80% of the Nigerian population by 2020. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the new administration in terms of legislation for the industry? </h4><p>We expect that the new administration will drive reforms, which will lead to a transformation where the industry will be able to actualize its potentials.  Counterfeiting is still a challenge and we, as a part of the industry, look forward to opportunities to collaborate with the government in designing and executing an anti-counterfeiting legislation with penalties that will serve as a deterrent to offenders. We are also looking forward to the government developing policies that will increase universal health coverage and access to medicines. Furthermore, we expect the government to drive reforms that will enable competitiveness of the industry.  As a key player in the pharmaceutical industry, GSK will continue to support these reforms.</p><h4>Counterfeiting is not a recent development in Nigeria. What measures can you implement to fight it and protect your brand?</h4><p>Counterfeiting has far-reaching implications. For the patients and consumers, using counterfeited medicines could lead to loss of life.  As a brand owner, we risk the loss of revenue and reputation damage. To fight counterfeiting, we constantly assess the impact of counterfeiting on our product portfolio and proffer mitigating solutions. As a leading pharmaceutical company, GSK is targeted by counterfeiters because of their attraction to its successful brands. We, therefore, take proactive steps to put in place covert and overt systems that safeguard these brands. In addition to these systems, we run awareness campaigns to ensure that consumers can identify the genuine products. Our sales force, who are ambassadors, are also trained in actions to take whenever they identify counterfeit products. In order to collaborate further with regulatory agencies, we conduct capacity building programs for the National Agency for Food &amp; Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) and the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON). We extend such activities to include the judiciary and customs. With these systems and the support of the relevant agencies and regulators, we are able to stem the counterfeit issue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major milestones have been achieved in 2015?</h4><p>The most important milestone we recorded at NAFDAC in 2015 was the reduction of counterfeit anti-malaria drugs from a prevalence of about 20 to 30.6%. We also expanded into a brand new building in June 2015, which was another achievement with respect to developing the infrastructure of the agency. We received accreditation of a drug control laboratory in Yaba that was also designated as a Centre of Excellence.</p><h4>A total of nearly $4 billion is lost every year from Nigerian non-oil exports being rejected by international markets. What are you doing to get Nigerian products approved?</h4><p>This has been a big challenge. The EU rejected Nigerian food items and agricultural products from its countries because of low quality. The Japanese rejected Nigeria's sesame seed because of a high prevalence of aflatoxins and mycotoxins. The UK has rejected Nigerian agricultural products in the past because of the high content of pesticide residue. It rejected beans because the pesticide residue was higher than the approved global level. What we are trying to do now is to clean up that sector of the economy in order to ensure that our products are wholesome, for both local consumers and the export market. These agricultural products that are rejected by international markets are actually what we consume here locally. What we need to do to be able to identify the source of contamination is to go to each farm and test. We need to have a laboratory that moves around the state and tests the beans at each farm as well as in the marketplace where consumers are buying the products so that we can identify the source of the problem. With something like this in place, we can do select training with the farmers and identify the problems, as some of them are using banned pesticides that are obsolete and no longer approved by the international committee. If we do this, we should be able to again get our products accepted by the international market.</p><h4>What do you think increased enforcement and improved testing can bring to the development of the agricultural sector?</h4><p>Every year, Nigeria imports more than NGN4 billion in rice, more than NGN2 billion in sugar, and more than NGN600 billion in wheat, all of which requires money that we do not have right now because of dwindling state revenues. These are products that we could produce here in Nigeria and even export our excess production to increase our foreign exchange reserves. This intervention would significantly help turn around the agricultural sector and subsequently the whole economy. The agricultural sector by itself has the capacity to absorb the massive cohort of the country's unemployed youth through well-paid jobs if we can properly train them to work with new technology on farms.</p><h4>What do you hope to achieve with the recent enforcement and increased scrutiny on firms across the economic spectrum?</h4><p>We scrutinized the pharmaceutical industry and helped it to improve its manufacturing practices. Four companies have been approved by the World Health Organization as meeting stringent global quality standards. There is no one standard for Nigeria, so everything we do should at least be to the same standard as global best practices. If firms want to be able to export their products to other countries, then they must meet the global standards. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main challenges Nigeria faces to increase the input of fertilizer?</h4><p>Many farmers lack awareness and the commercial mindset to be able to connect the use of fertilizers and improved seed to the output and productivity increases. That is the big challenge that Nigeria and the bulk of sub-Saharan Africa have been facing. Best practice should be set at about 200kg per ha. Global use is somewhere between 90 and 100kg per ha. In sub-Saharan Africa we are using less than 100kg per ha, so it is incredibly small. </p><h4>What policy approaches would help the government deliver more fertilizer to farmers in larger quantities?</h4><p>We have used our own private sector approach to get fertilizers to the farmers. The government has tried to introduce a subsidy program. In some cases this has worked, and in some cases it has been undercut by middlemen, so the real benefits never get to the farmers. The government should create an enabling environment to allow the private sector to manage the entire distribution and sales process, develop the channels into the market, and train farmers. The biggest challenge we have in Nigeria today is broken value chains. We have the input supply system, the production, the processing,  and then we have the market. The farmer today is everything. Their yields are low, but they have to figure out how to get their product to market. We are experiencing about 50% post-harvest losses in Nigeria today, even with minimal yields. The most important thing is creating an outlet for farmers when explosive yields occur, and educating about the impact of good quality input and improving yields. When this is achieved, the focus is channeling yields into the market and processing through the value chains. We see the government helping to develop some of that by giving low interest loans to attract people not just to farming itself, but also processing, and being able to divert the subsidy to the output so that when farmers have huge yields and cannot get to market, the government can guarantee the off-take of those yields and stabilize prices for the farmers. Another important factor is infrastructure. Infrastructure is key for the movement of products and fertilizers into farming areas and delivering the output back to the marketplace. For us today, it is cheaper to deliver fertilizer to Germany than to Kano in Nigeria. We really need to focus on having good roads, rail, and ports to move these products across the country. We have ports, but adequate rail and roads infrastructure is lacking.</p><h4>Does your current production meet the local demands for fertilizer?</h4><p>Nigeria's total fertilizer consumption today is about 1 million tons, which may require an additional 300,000 tons of phosphate and potash to be able to supply the entire 1 million tons. Having said that, the latent demand is far higher than that because if we compare Nigeria to Pakistan, for example, both countries have about the same area and population. Nigeria has about three times more arable land than Pakistan, though, so there are many more farming opportunities in Nigeria. Nigeria and Pakistan have the same kind of smallholder farming structures—farmers farming on one or two ha of land. However, Pakistan uses 10 million tons of fertilizers. This is because its average fertilizer utilization is about 100kg per ha. Nigeria is the largest importer of rice today, even though we could grow all the rice we need here. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>FMN has been a key player in the agricultural industry and food processing for many years; what trends have driven the company's growth over the past five to ten years?</h4><p>Our core business is food, and we started wheat milling over 50 years ago. We started with one mill producing 500 metric tons per day. Today our capacity has grown to 10,000 metric tons per day and we can confidently say that we are one of the biggest flour milling operations in this part of the world. Over the decades, we have diversified, rather than limiting ourselves to the production of flour for the bread baking and confectionery industries. In 1972, we established the first plant for producing pasta in Nigeria. Today, we are the biggest pasta manufacturing company in Africa. FMN has further diversified in the recent past into the production of noodles, snacks, and breakfast cereals that primarily use locally sourced ingredients. Currently, we are also the largest agro-allied company in the country. Our strategy is to develop value chains, particularly with crops where we have a comparative advantage in Nigeria. We aggregate corn in this country from local farms and process it into animal feed and have developed our animal feed business to become the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa. We have animal feed processing plants in Ibadan, Sapele, and Calabar with a combined output of 700,000 metric tons per annum, making it the largest in sub-Saharan Africa. As we produce animal feed, we are also keen to develop our poultry operation. In addition, we have a sugar refinery in Lagos, which has a capacity of 750,000 tons per annum, and due to the National Master Plan we have developed sugar estates and a vegetable oil and margarine processing facility by ROM Oil, an FMN subsidiary company. Our strategy is to ensure that we strengthen our core food business through diversification of our business by going downstream, and also supporting our business through the agro-allied businesses by expanding the value chains that will help to sustain and develop local content.</p><h4>Earlier this year you sold your cement business to Lafarge. What drove that decision?</h4><p>In order for us concentrate or expand our two portfolios in the food business and in the agro-allied business, we decided to divest from cement, where we are just partial players. Formerly, we had held around a 30% stake in UNICEM from Calabar Cement, and Lafarge and Holcim were holding the balance of 70% and, from the moment they merged in 2014, we were at a terrible disadvantage. It was natural that we would then divest and concentrate on our core business.</p><h4>How would you characterize your performance and the health of the sector for 2015?</h4><p>Most of the bottom line profit came from the sale of our cement operations. It was  otherwise a tough year. There were the issues of irregular gas supply, intense gridlock in Apapa due to tanker drivers' strikes, and the naira devaluation. We depend on imports, so that was wiping out our bottom line. Also, the entire north-east of Nigeria in the three states of Yobe, Borno, and Adamawa, were totally cut off because of the insurgency activities and so on. People were displaced, and so the market all but collapsed in those places. So with these issues it was obvious that we could not maintain our top line or grow. We should be commended for any result that we got, because under similar circumstances, many companies would have been wiped out.</p><h4>How was FMN affected by the Forex restrictions on imports recently issued by the Central Bank?</h4><p>I support the decision, especially for the restrictions on rice, which we should be producing here ourselves. However, I think the Central Bank should be very clear and let us know what the monetary policy is with regard to foreign exchange and help the businesses, manufacturing, industry, and investors to know exactly where they belong. Otherwise, if we do not have consistency, we do not have confidence in the direction that the monetary policy will go, and it will be difficult to plan and hard for investors to enter the market.</p><h4>You recently announced that Flour Mills would seek to raise capital; what would be your preferred method of access to capital and where would the funds be invested?</h4><p>We are highly leveraged because of the investments that we have made, especially in the agro-allied space in the last five years, and it has raised our debt profile. We are under the weight of high interest payments and that is what we plan to address. In order to do that, we have to source our funds from areas other than banks, and that is why we are planning a rights issue. The rights issue will give opportunities for our shareholders to support the company and help the company lower its debt profile. That will also confirm the confidence of shareholders in the company, who know that the company is undervalued in the stock market and that this is the time to take advantage. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Lekki Gardens different from the rest of the sector?</h4><p>It starts with our intimate understanding of the needs of the clients who invest in real estate. From the onset, it was not about construction technique, land use, pricing or innovative designs, but about helping people get the best results with their real estate investing. We first started to look at real estate as an investment vehicle for people to build wealth in 2008, when we were teaching people to invest their funds in real estate. We started buying large parcels of land in the suburbs and creating serviced plots for people to buy and build their homes themselves. We did that for almost two years from late 2009 until about mid 2011. The land use problem in Lagos makes it difficult for people to build houses and so we started to see cases where we would sell land and people would not be able to construct their homes. They could not get approvals easily in these areas due to traditional land and villages land use practices that hampered development. We decided to undertake a project in 2011 to help in this regard and we came up with Lekki Gardens Phase I in Lekki, Lagos with 350 houses and a project value of about $20 million. The concept was to make housing affordable, provide a great location and make it as comfortable as possible for the clients to pay over a period of time. And with the success of that small project of 350 units, we started our housing project in Lekki, Lagos. We thought it would take us three years to market, develop, and complete the project; however, it was sold out within four months and we completed it in another seven months. That changed the dynamics for everyone. To date, we have delivered about 6,000 home units with commitments to deliver another 12,000 within the next year. We have about 57 projects currently underway across Nigeria in four states; Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and Ogun states. Out of those 57 projects, we have delivered about 20.  </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The market remains unpredictable. Experts have been advising us not to make any big bets, because the economy is a bit too uncertain. We are in critical times, and we do not see an immediate bolstering of the economy. We foresee the economy taking some stable form; however, not toward an aggressive growth trajectory. We have enjoyed superb growth for the past three years. We started in the real estate business with NGN750,000, which was at most about $5,000 in 2009; that is all we could muster as a business owners. In the last few years, we have done businesses in hundreds of millions of dollars annually. We never received capital injections from any other source, and we do not have any major shareholders or debts. We have borrowed in bits in the past, but not taken on substantial debt, and in three years we have done huge volumes. In the past three years, there has been no year that we have not grown at least 100%. Sometimes we have grown by 700% or 1,000%. In 2016, we want to consolidate. We started consolidation in January 2015; we still have to do a lot more of that and restructuring as well, so we do not expect a lot of explosive growth so that we can contain the growth that we have. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In what projects is FCC involved in throughout the country?</h4><p>We have two projects; one is the new control tower for El Dorado International Airport and another building next to the tower, which is the Civil Aeronautics management building. The latter will control the airspace in Colombia along with another such center in Barranquilla. The control tower is a 90m high building, doubling the current size of the tower. Both projects are very important for the expansion of the airport. We expect to inaugurate the tower in November this year. The second project we currently handle is the flood control of the Bogotá River for the Regional Autonomous Corporation of Cundinamarca. We dredged the river to an average of 2m and built a dike and small beach areas in order to control the growth of the rivers and avoid future floods. By doing this, we doubled the hydraulic capacity of the river from 100 cubic meters per second to 200 cubic meters per second. At the same time, this project also includes the development of natural areas along the river to compensate communities for the activity we currently carry out. This includes the plantation of over 100,000 trees. We are talking about a $60 million to $70 million of investment.</p><h4>What is the importance of the fourth generation highway projects for Colombia?</h4><p>Since October 2015, there have been almost 20 projects as part of the fourth generation tender waves and most of them need to be financially closed now. This is important also because, in a year's time, the projects should be completed and the financial closing reassures parties of having the funding necessary for the construction of the project. This is a common situation and we have seen projects being postponed for five or even 10 years already. This is bad since the concessionaire also sees their terms postponed, and that limits part of the funding they counted on for the construction of the project.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges the infrastructure development sector faces right now in Colombia?</h4><p>Land availability and land property are one of the main issues right now. This also includes relationships with local communities and environmental licensing. At the same time, the country faces a challenge in terms of project and equity management. There should be a more common understanding of the importance of these projects, because the country needs them for its future development.</p><h4>What are the main elements foreign companies should take into account when targeting projects in Colombia?</h4><p>One of the main elements is to have foreign expertise in such projects, which FCC has with the main infrastructure projects we developed in Spain. Also, foreign companies require a local partner, a company that understands and knows the local market. In this context, it is very important to establish clear roles for both parties. Having said that, PPPs surely have great potential here and should be fully exploited.</p><h4>What upcoming projects will FCC be participating in?</h4><p>We will be actively participating in the Toyo Tunnel, the longest such infrastructure in the country at 9.8km, which has a budget of over COP1 billion. The expansion of the Wastewater Treatment Plant of Salitre is another project, which has a budget of more than $500 million. This project is publicly funded, the World Bank being one of the organizations backing it.</p><h4>What is the strategic importance of Colombia for FCC?</h4><p>Colombia is a strategic market for the company in the region and the target for the near future is to diversify its presence in the country. In this context, the infrastructure segment can be a vital sector for the company. FCC has shown its commitment toward Colombia. I think the arrival of Carlos Slim only reinforced this idea and strategy within the group. Carlos Slim can give the company the financial muscle we require to target the largest and most important projects in the region. This is a key region for FCC and Carlos Slim's arrival just strengthens this idea. I foresee a rapid expansion of FCC in the region.</p><h4>How do you see FCC developing in Colombia in the next couple of years?</h4><p>We want to consolidate our activity here with the two projects I mentioned. We know that over 85% of the infrastructure projects here require joint ventures and PPPs, meaning basically private investment. Our consolidation will come with our increasing participation in several of these projects. There is the third wave of the fourth generation projects coming up soon and FCC will try to position itself as a key player for the development of some of these projects.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you position the Daimler brands within the Nigerian market?</h4><p>We are responsible for the entire line of Daimler brands in the Nigerian market, and in particular the Mercedes-Benz brand, which has a long tradition of over 50 years in the market. Parallel to that, we also took over responsibility in Nigeria for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and brands like Chrysler, Jeep, and Dodge have a strong market in the country. The market is driven somewhat by the construction industry and the haulage business, because transportation is key in Nigeria. We have seven accredited dealers that report directly to us so that we capture and cover most of the regions in Nigeria for all of our brands. Of course the biggest relevance for now is Lagos, representing 60% turnover and sales. For now, the ratio of sales of passenger cars to commercial vehicles is about 55:45.</p><h4>Mercedes' global business in passenger cars is evolving. How has the onslaught of new products from Mercedes affected the way that you market in Nigeria?</h4><p>There is the constant innovation in terms of the E-Class and S-Class, and now newer products have come into the market. 4x4 technology has also played an important role; the GL class, now known as the GLS, the M-class, also now known as the GLE, and the G-class are our traditional players in the 4x4 segment. Here we have to adjust and adapt to the local needs, and those larger vehicles fit the bill. We also do equipment adaptation for this market; our products have been adapted and homologated to meet the demands of the African markets, and the Nigerian market in particular. Beyond those premium offerings, there is the compact car segment, which is dominated by the A-class, B-class, the CLA, and the GLA, which is the smallest 4x4 vehicle we currently have in our portfolio. The acceptance is also quite good in Nigeria because the middle class is developing further. People have a choice regarding what to purchase, and they want to play in a field where a little premium is already something they can afford, and that is why we are very prepared also to meet this demand in Nigeria.</p><h4>How have the newer, compact models performed in Nigeria?</h4><p>It took a little bit of time to introduce new models because it is a traditional limousine market. The S-class has a market share of 78%. In Nigeria, we are proud to always be the market leader in this segment. When we came up with the compact car models we also had to bear in mind that we have to be very competitive in this segment. We have improved and increased our after-sales activities. We have also worked to improve our presence on social media and to encourage people to interact with the brand, which has introduced us to a whole new generation. This is how we are structuring the passenger car business and we have the entire Mercedes-Benz portfolio currently available in Nigeria.</p><h4>How have macroeconomic conditions in Nigeria affected your commercial vehicles business?</h4><p>Until 2013, we had successful growth to report, especially in the heavy-duty commercial vehicle business. Now we have established a very strong position in Nigeria. Here we are talking about a construction sector, in particular, which relies heavily on excellent products with long durability, but also with resale value after a period of five to eight years. After five to eight years, Mercedes-Benz trucks still have a resale value of about 60% of the price of a new one. This is actually a vital aspect that fleet operators and companies that are engaged in the haulage and construction business consider when buying commercial vehicles. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>PASHA Holding is involved in essentially every major sector of the economy. How do you go about organizing such a multi-faceted holding group?</h4><p>Currently, that is at the top of our agenda. From 2006 to 2012, we worked in an opportunistic way, trying to capture as much of the market share and clients as possible. After 2012, the situation changed in the region and the large markets that surround Azerbaijan were affected. We started thinking about optimization and improving corporate governance in terms of trimming costs and removing inefficiencies. Previously, we were loosely running the corporate agenda from the center of PASHA Holding; however, we realized that we needed some stronger controls to prepare ourselves for the economic slowdown. In 2014, we started to talk to McKinsey &amp; Company in order to shape our strategy more efficiently and create an organizational structure that would yield a more efficient management model. We completed the project at the beginning of 2015, and now we are actively implementing this new corporate governance model, leading to the creation of more units, such as a banking group at the corporate center level. In the banking sector in Azerbaijan, we own two banks and we also expanded to own two regional banks, namely PASHA Bank Georgia and PASHA Bank Turkey. The need for further coordination was clear. The model we used was sophisticated by international standards, which required us to raise our capacities to meet these international levels. Now, we are much better equipped to deal with an economic slowdown. When business development is lagging, it is a good time to look internally to minimize costs and optimize the processes. That was the main purpose of this project.</p><h4>How do the private equity services provided by PASHA Holding foster growth and competitiveness as a method of alternative financing for potential firms in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We were pioneers in experimenting with this; however, it requires a certain level of sophistication from the other side as well. There are certain issues we are still dealing with—the penetration of the banking sector into the economy is still limited, corporate governance standards are not adopted, and there are also some issues with basic financial management in local companies. We have developed a model where we can assist these companies through our private equity investment fund, rather than our banks. Because this is a risky model, we have also required some of our candidate clients to do some reforms in terms of financial management and corporate governance. In our private equity portfolio, we have around 10-15 projects. Some of them are already signed and some are in the process of due diligence. There are still issues we need to work on in this model, like exit strategies. For this model to be successful, there has to be capital markets, which are limited in Azerbaijan at this stage, and strong strategic sponsors, which we are helping to develop. We must also have more active participation from foreign investors, which the government is working to support; however, the critical mass needed is still not there. I would like private equity to become a pillar of business for PASHA Holding because the upside is enormous. We are the first; no one has even experimented with it yet. On the private equity side, we are incurring all the risks, but could potentially gain all the upsides. </p><h4>Are there any sectors of the economy in which PASHA Holding is looking to expand?</h4><p>We are looking at tourism as a potentially booming sector going forward, and we are initiating a couple of pilot projects in agriculture. We believe the next boom in Azerbaijan should be agriculture. Almost all of Azerbaijan has fertile soil and the markets are close. However, the nearby Arab and European markets demand we certify our agricultural products. Certification is one of the elements of the chain that is not yet in place. To enter other markets and export in a systemic way, our producers need to upgrade their capacity in many ways. PASHA Holding has two fairly large pilot projects in agriculture and, based on the success of those, we will design our future plans accordingly. This is a challenging sector because you operate on much slimmer margins and you have to be efficient. In addition, you have to be excellent at developing both local and international markets. Countries such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia have a large capacity to purchase agricultural goods; however, we do not produce on that scale yet. For the short term, we are looking at this agricultural experiment. We try to maximize our return from our traditional sectors, but also try to position ourselves in terms of diversification for the future in other sectors.</p><h4>PASHA Holding is a minority equity holder in a SOCAR polymer project. What was the impetus behind PASHA Holding's involvement in this investment?</h4><p>There is a new era of industrial development in Azerbaijan. The petrochemical industry is being redeveloped in accordance with best practices and modern technologies. Our goal is to see how these types of projects are managed. We have a minority interest, but, in absolute terms, it exceeds the limit that we usually allocate for individual projects in our mainstream program. We have invested around $25 million in this project. We made this exception because the project was intriguing from many different points of view. It will be interesting to see how the completed project will enter the market as commodity prices fluctuate. The project coordination and planning was carried out at a very advanced level, to the credit of SOCAR. We are happy that SOCAR brought other local large business groups to participate as well. We have a 10% interest in this project.</p><h4>PASHA Holding has established itself in countries abroad. What is your focus for investment strategies outside of Azerbaijan?</h4><p>We are a regional group. We looked at some of the potential expansion opportunities three years ago, including Western Europe, but we decided it was premature. Our strategy for 2015-2017 is focusing on establishing our footing in the region—in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. We are the only private bank that has an arm in each of those countries. Our niches include private equity within the mainstream business and private banking. If we can properly position ourselves for the future, there will be quite an impressive upside on those sectors, even though they are sensitive. We are welcoming these challenges, but focusing on our main areas of strengths. We don't want to sacrifice our traditional strong sectors such as banking, insurance, and construction to develop new investments; they should develop with a coherent plan and without subsidization from the primary segments. For example, in 2015, 70-75% of our net profits were contributed by retail banking. If the capital markets develop according to plan we could spin off some of our assets and put them in the market to get an upside in terms of funding and access to other markets. The Istanbul stock exchange is a potential venue where we could list some of our small assets—maybe 10-15% of shares—just to see how the market reacts. That may be part of the next strategy. For our three-year strategy, we are focusing more on securing the gains made over these last 10 years and then we will design the strategy of how to enter new ventures, such as agriculture.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your main areas of business today?</h4><p>The two areas of our business that we want to focus on in the next phase of growth are Metro Taxis and Metro Buses, because these represent real value for all of our stakeholders. For the first time, we will be able to provide buses to commuters in Lagos that are comparable with any developed city around the world. Moreover, we will be able to provide local content for those buses in terms of manufacturing and assembly, as well as support for the buses and key acquisition for organizations working out of those locations. This initiative will of course have a complementary effect for tire trading and spare parts manufacturing. That represents a huge gain for the Lagos government, for the people of Lagos, and also for the rest of Nigeria, because it is scalable and can go to all of the other cities. </p><h4>How has Philly and Mools developed, and what motivated your entry into the mass transit segment?</h4><p>We did not want to run a taxi company, we wanted to advocate for the taxis that were already in Lagos, because we already had experience with financial institutions and we were also an existing car dealership. We wanted to increase the fleet size, add newer vehicles, and be a bit more representative of fleets in major cities all over the world. Taxis represent a part of the culture of a city; Londoners ride in the Black Cabs, which are not found anywhere else, and New York has the Yellow Taxi. We started with 50 vehicles, and now we have more than 480 vehicles with a fully-fledged dispatch system. We noticed that bus transportation was also a huge issue in Lagos, so we approached the Lagos governor and proposed bringing in 500 buses. We currently have eight routes out of the 22 that we have set as a target to achieve. We have successfully deployed 150 out of 500 buses, and we deploy them in phases of 50.</p><h4>What progress are you making towards meeting the demand for buses in Lagos?</h4><p>There is a huge drive to encourage people to get on buses and out of their personal vehicles. We aim to reduce gas emissions by reducing the number of vehicles on the road, by being environmentally responsible, and by building a sustainable transport system. A 21km road in Lagos has the capacity to efficiently move 800 buses, as opposed to 5,000 individual personal vehicles. Mass transit also creates jobs and trains the workforce in new skill sets. For every bus that we put on the road, we create jobs for about seven or eight people—drivers, a mechanical team, an electrical team, a body shop team, and refrigeration team for the air conditioner, as well as indirect employment for spare parts suppliers, logistics companies, and the back-office employment, such as human resources and finance. In terms of the next three to four years, Lagos State will need no less than 3,000 buses to effectively cover the length and breadth of Lagos. Lagos has pockets of suburbs and entry points into Lagos where people have to commute daily to and from the center. There are huge opportunities for growth there and it is one way that we can transform the city.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Metro Taxi will build a new strategy. Uber is now in Lagos, which is changing the business model in the areas where they have operations. We will develop a bus application to be used not just by Metro Taxi would use, but by the whole taxi industry. Our market is growing and new routes need to be opened with more buses put on the road. Transportation is a major part of the new government's policies, and they want to open develop the sector in Lagos. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is NIMASA's mandate in Nigeria, and what are the most important issues that the agency handles today?</h4><p>Our first mandate is promoting indigenous shipping capacity both internationally and locally, and the second concerns the regulation of the maritime industry in terms of labor, marine environment pollution prevention and control, and security and safety of the Nigerian maritime domain. NIMASA is also Nigeria's government agency responsible for the implementation and enforcement of all regulations, conventions, and protocols of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) as ratified by the country. We are also now engaged in building a dockyard specifically for indigenous shipping companies. NIMASA is also engaged in training Nigerian seafarers through direct sponsorship of young Nigerians in reputable institutions abroad and also funding Nigeria's premier maritime training institution, the Maritime Academy of Nigeria in Oron, Akwa Ibom State. The agency has also established institutes in some Nigerian universities that offer maritime training courses. So far we have partnered with six universities. NIMASA also has a special program whereby loans are disbursed to indigenous operators for fleet expansion. We enforce the Coastal and Inland Shipping Act, which stipulates that vessels trading in Nigerian waters must be built in Nigeria, owned by Nigerians, registered in Nigeria, and crewed by Nigerians. </p><h4>Regarding the new ministers, what changes do you expect from the administration?</h4><p>We expect positive changes. Our supervising minister is pragmatic and has a reputation for infrastructural renewal; we expect him to bring this experience to bear on the various facets of the maritime industry. We are optimistic that the government will make good on its desire to diversify the economy and therefore support all sectors of the economy to fulfill their potential. I expect tremendous changes, development, and improvement for the general welfare of Nigerians. </p><h4>In the coming years, how will NIMASA improve business practices in the maritime sector in Nigeria?</h4><p>To open up an investment environment, regulations need to be less stringent, yet also meet internationally recognized standards, and the environment for these businesses must be secure in terms of capital and physical security. We have entered into MoUs with the Nigerian Navy and the Nigerian Air Force for the purpose of round-the-clock coastal patrols and air surveillance to ensure that vessels navigate in and out of Nigeria without molestation. We are also acquiring faster boats, expanding our radar communication, and developing surveillance by obtaining some new audiovisual equipment that will enhance ship to shore communication as well as search and rescue operations. We have also developed our own satellite surveillance system that is capable of detecting vessel movements within Nigeria's coast extending into the entire Gulf of Guinea. What we need to do now is develop responders so that if we see anything, we can respond on time. NIMASA is also working to improve the ease of doing business by consolidating regulations and reducing areas of functional overlap with other agencies. Safety and ease of business are our top priorities.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect growth in the revenue, especially in the non-oil sector. I also expect expansion in both our imports and exports, and a more disciplined business environment. By 2016, we are going to implement more disciplinary measures, so that people will come independently to pay taxes and levies and we will not have to waste energy going after them to enforce compliance. With the new determination and commitment of the President Buhari administration, we can see that there is going to be a more conducive business and operating environment that will be beneficial to all stakeholders in terms of adequate returns to investors and a safe and secure environment for operators, as well as increased revenue for the government with the ultimate positive impact on the citizenry. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since 2014, how has the outdoor advertising market developed?</h4><p>The market for outdoor advertising is evolving in Nigeria. We have more and more innovative platforms coming out periodically. The market has been expanding, with many new players and practitioners entering the business. Also, advertisers are making the most of arising opportunities to showcase products. Our outdoor spending in 2014 was NGN20.5 billion . Although digital outlets present many opportunities the occupancy level is still lower than expected from the advertising brands.</p><h4>How did the election influence outdoor advertising?</h4><p>Preparation for the 2015 election enabled the outdoor medium to showcase its relevance to the public. Numerous campaigns and many players in the political arena showcased their candidates and messages. Predictably, the huge patronage during the election would be expected to impact 2015 ad spend.</p><h4>You have the largest digital billboard in Nigeria, what is the take-up for that product? Are you planning to invest more into digital advertising? </h4><p>The Iconic Digital Out of Home platform on the Third Mainland Bridge is known as “The Lion" within our portfolio. This is a unique platform in terms of engaging customers. What you see on that platform is not present anywhere else in Nigeria, it is a high definition platform, and we have full occupancy of brands on it. This includes Telecoms such as Heineken Glo, MTN, Mountain Dew, and also Star, whereby it is a medium engaging, connecting and interacting with consumers, but also, therefore, a delight for advertisers. Other platforms are coming up, both in and out of Lagos, as well as in other cities around Nigeria.</p><h4>How are you addressing the electricity requirements for these digital platforms?<br></h4><p>All of our digital sites are equipped with power generating sets, and we are also looking at a hybrid scheme of generators powered by diesel and gas to minimize consumption. The power sector has been privatized by the government, but we have yet to see the positive effects of the privatization on our installations. Although we have transformers from the national grid installed on our digital sites, they have not been consistent enough for us to expect a good delivery of power to those sites, so on each of them we have at least two gen sets, so there is backup. In the future, we expect the market for power to stabilize. A new government has taken office and I am sure that it will address the issue of power, which is vital to this sector of the economy in order to make progress.</p><h4>What about expansion beyond Lagos and Abuja? What are your ambitions for the rest of the country?<br></h4><p>Our strategy rests on product leadership and operational efficiency. What we are doing currently is to consolidate our presence in key towns in Nigeria, and this involves two things, namely dominance and a presence in key convergent areas of influence. This is our strategy for all of the high traffic areas in the cities of Nigeria. We are expanding into the cities to demonstrate our preeminence with products that will give us both mileage and credibility.</p><h4>Overall, what are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>As the economy improves, we will move into other areas and consolidate our position in the industry. A lot of developments are coming up in the country and we are also talking with the government to see how we can be a part of the new road network and other infrastructure under construction. Our business is a part of the environment, and you cannot have an environment without an ambient OOH landscape. We expect that as the infrastructure develops and improves, OOH products will also rise in a number of new areas, and that we can begin to partner with the government. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[opportunity-now]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Accenture adapted to the rapid technological change that characterizes the Nigerian market?</h4><p>The changes observed in Nigeria over the past couple years centered around mobility. We have had 143 million phone subscribers, close to 30 million of which are smartphone users. Internet penetration is rising, and this has encouraged tech startups, whereby more apps are being produced for mobile phones than ever before. There are also many tech companies and GSM companies that are going beyond voice into data and multimedia. Nollywood is also highly active with digital video, music downloads, and entertainment. The second change has to do with the cloud, and GSM companies are now providing cloud-based services. An SME can now have operations in the cloud, and banking, too, is becoming cloud-based. In the past, Accenture had three functions including technology, consulting, and outsourcing.</p><h4>Nigeria is considered to be one of the fastest growing technology and communications markets in the world. How does this market factor into Accenture's global operations?</h4><p>Globally, Accenture has five major industry groups with the government, financial services, communications, resources, and operations. Telecom is a major industry sector for Accenture, and is a major part of our CMT Practice (Communications, Media and Technology). Given the maturity level of the Nigerian market,  we are mostly involved in the telecom sector in Nigeria, versus technology and the media. Those two sectors are still fragmented, while telecom is a major growth area, accounting for upward of 18-20% of Accenture's local revenues. Telecoms are quite important for us, and we are working with two of the four telecoms providers to serve the public.</p><h4>Has the devaluation of the naira led to an increase in more efficient technology services and solutions or an outsourcing, in line with national trends?</h4><p>The devaluation and subsequent decline in revenue, as well as the uncertainty of elections all made 2015 a highly challenging year for our clients. In addition, we had uncertainty with security in 1Q2015 and 2Q2015. Our clients have responded in a number of ways, one being to cut their discretionary spending. Some of them are also looking to make structural changes, and have looked at outsourcing their IT departments. They are changing their management strategies and are looking for ways to consolidate and rationalize their IT footprint. They are doing so to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and ensure optimization. A number of clients are making good use of this crisis to affect management changes and improve efficiency. They are going for local and predictable operations. We are working with two banks to develop strategies for digital banking.</p><h4>In terms of hiring, you either have to build talent or import it. When you look for talent in Nigeria, do you have difficulty finding qualified people?</h4><p>There is a shortage of talent in Nigeria, and most graduates seem unprepared for employment. Therefore, we have started a one-year graduate training program. We focus on the skills that Accenture requires in their employees such as data gathering and analysis, communication, business writing, team building, interpersonal skills, negotiation, and basic technology skills. These form the basis of the skills we are looking for, and these are also all-important coupled with ethics and doing what is right for the business and in business. There are other areas where local Nigerians do not have the right experience and relevance, and we are having to attract Nigerians from the diaspora who are willing to return. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>A stable security situation and general safety would allow our clients to conduct business better in the different geopolitical regions of the country. Our clients would then be able to use technology to serve nationwide and improve their supply chain, especially the supply chain to the far north and the deep south. This will improve business confidence and allow the mentality that Accenture will be able to help more with operations once stability improves. The country will then be back on its growth trajectory that will greatly exceed 5% next year and will in turn also allow further growth for our clients. Accenture has been capable of growth of 20% over the past five years, which has continued YoY. In 2015, we were not in that growth territory for the reasons outlined earlier, although we anticipate returning to it in 2016. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the business evolved to its current stage?</h4><p>MultiChoice Nigeria has been in the country for 22 years. From the beginning, we believed in bringing the best entertainment to people's screens. We are a video entertainment company, so even if it meant initially bringing in foreign content, we then started developing local content—music, movies, sports—that met international standards. Over the years, we have been able to build a local business, one that both imports and exports content.</p><h4>What are your greatest successes in Nigeria in terms of content creation?</h4><p>The soap opera Tinsel is a good example. Over 1,500 episodes have now run, making it the longest-running content to come from Nigeria. It is a large-scale production—it has literally impacted Nigeria's GDP, as it has created jobs both in front and behind the camera. The projection of the next five years is around 70% growth in our sector. We created a market—which did not exist previously—and, in turn, we created demand. With demand, we now have people keen to work and put content on the table. Some people were willing to buy, and we were the first to buy and commission local content from Africa. Initially, this market didn't exist, but now people are suddenly recognizing the growing contribution of entertainment on the economy. We are still in our infancy, and need growth, development and supervision to ensure that we create quality that can compete internationally. “Nollywood" produces more movies than Hollywood per annum. </p><h4>How do you package the content to fit the taste of a country as diverse as Nigeria?</h4><p>We cater to the market not only from a pricing perspective—we have a variety of subscriptions, from affordable to premium, so that we do not leave anyone out—but also by taking region and language into consideration. We have AfricaMagic channels in Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo. We also study the trends, establish what needs there are, and introduce programs that meet demand.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In the entertainment business it is all about emotions. The change in government promises exciting developments in terms of new infrastructure, which will positively impact our organization and every business in Nigeria. Everyone is looking forward to better infrastructure because, with that, the economy will grow. We will be developing more content. We launched a new Igbo channel some months ago, which has substantial demand for content. Many content producers had not been producing in the Igbo language, yet now we have created demand for a new class of movies, documentaries, and other content. We will also be opening new studios shortly in Lagos. That again confirms long-term commitment. Innovation being developed, we believe, will expedite economic recovery. Through Nollywood and other productions, Nigerians have proven their creativity. We may not have the biggest industries and we may be behind the curve in certain sectors, but we can get ahead in terms of entertainment through the right investment and effective curating. In terms of Nollywood, we consume more than 80% of what is produced. We are the enterprise that puts the Nigerian movies and content into African markets. That industry is only going to grow, and we are developing a structure. For example, we have a product that allows viewers to rent a movie from their couch, that is our BoxOffice. Nollywood has struggled with distribution and piracy—the key challenge in our industry. Our product allows movie producers to have their movie rented from someone's couch, which means he gets paid for rentals. We think that structure is an example of what will drive growth. As producers get paid, they have the confidence to produce more content. And as they do so, quality improves, allowing us to compete with Hollywood. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts are you making to grow the ICT industry and what growth have you seen in the past couple of years?</h4><p>The Demo Africa Event, for example, was successful for quite a number of our start-ups. There were around 600 start-ups that competed, and 30 to 40 made it to the finals. Investors from Europe, the US, and all over the world came, and many of these investors indicated a desire to invest in almost all of our start-ups that were showcased at Demo Africa. In terms of statistics, it is difficult to give exact figures, however, if we combine the activities of Demo Africa and that of our E-Nigeria Event, there are potentially over 100 start-ups being exposed to global and local investors. Locally developed solutions for education are mature and robust. Some of these local developers are taking universities or schools from low performance to outstanding. There is also the perspective of catalyzing productivity across all sectors of the economy, from health to agriculture. We are leading municipal departments to develop the national health framework. The first version has been shared with the general public and the effort is to develop a partnership between regionalized initiatives, the UN foundation, NITDA, the Ministry of Health, and a host of other stakeholders. An important thrust is the partnership between NITDA and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). </p><h4>How will the smart city initiative concentrate innovation?</h4><p>We are working with the ministry to develop an idea called the Information Technology Entrepreneurship Accelerator, which is meant to promote start-ups. However, when I came on board, I decided to establish an office of ICT innovation and entrepreneurship to coordinate our investments in IT parks, smart cities, incubation centers, software development centers, and so on. In Lagos, our flagship investment is a partnership with the Nigerian Computer Society called Lagos Smart City; we showcased it in Dubai and there is a lot of investment interest from international investors. It is our flagship for a smart city because it is conveniently situated in the most attractive zone of development in the country, the Lekki Free Trade Zone. Right in the middle, we have our Lagos Smart City project of 48ha that is adjacent to the Lagos Business School. We are looking to grow a smart city that will benefit from the existence of gas in Lagos and high-speed, fiber-optic internet from the major operators. There is substantial internet capacity in Lagos close to the construction of this smart-city estate, so there will be access to high-speed internet and this will be the attraction of a smart city. It will be a mixed-development city featuring a business district in an upmarket medium to high-income area. We want to make it a pilot that can be replicated in other parts of the country. The Abuja Technology Village offers an opportunity for similar development because the space there is around 700ha, compared to the 48ha in Lagos. We are already in talks with Abuja Technology Village for ICT projects via the World Bank. We are in the process of negotiating the amount of space we need to relocate our GSM villages there. We are working with African investors to have close proximity and sign agreements on the way forward to develop a mini IT Park. We have the Lagos idea of being closely located with the procreation hub, which is a private sector initiative and a media-sponsored smart city in Lagos. In Calabar, we have two projects, where one is an idea hub and the other is a knowledge city, which is a partnership with the municipal government.  We also have the provision for building the tunnel IT Park. In the space we have a number of interventions and are looking to have them on stream and operational in a short time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Etisalat is the most recent entrant into the mobile market here, but it has grown quickly; what strategies have made this possible?</h4><p>We have had a much stronger focus on quality of service, and a better focus on the youth market and innovation. As the fourth to arrive, five-10 years after the other operators, we cannot do what everybody else has done. We set ourselves apart to convince people to leave their existing operators and join Etisalat, in addition to tapping into the new customers in the market. We are known as the data company and the company that young people choose. The combination of Abu Dhabi and Nigeria has worked well. I have to salute our foreign partners because, apart from the initial equity that they have provided, they provided the company with a significant proportion of shareholders loans so we have not had to rely on expensive bank debt as much as the other telecom companies have done.</p><h4>How has the influx of lower cost smartphones and cheaper data reshaped the sector?</h4><p>The data revolution was always going to happen. The more applications that become available, the more vital data becomes. Many thought that the size of that market would be constricted because of the expense of smartphones, but Chinese companies have reduced the cost of producing these handsets, allowing for the kinds of innovations that we are seeing now. It is not only Apple or Samsung or HTC in the market anymore. There is an entire range of phones capable of the same functions, from mobile money to innovations in the healthcare and education fields. I have just started working with a company called Bridge Academy that has developed text message-based education for the low-income segment, which would not have been possible without the use of mobile technology and inexpensive smartphones with built-in fiber networks. The broadband revolution has made all of these things possible.</p><h4>What is the role of telecoms and investors in developing an ecosystem of innovation in Nigeria?</h4><p>Our investments in telecoms companies are made to provide the opportunity to rapidly launch their products on our networks, in a manner that recognizes their contribution. We need to provide support as investors for the expansion of the business, and we need to take more risks investing in entities beyond our personal connections to ensure that in 10 years there are major scaled up African tech companies.</p><h4>How does Etisalat aim to resolve the barrier presented by the unbanked population?</h4><p>Nigeria has a tremendous amount of catching up to do, and much of that has to do with the regulatory environment. Kenya has moved faster than Nigeria because their regulations were more conducive to the development of mobile phone companies. Nigeria and the Central Bank have some concerns regarding the combination of the need for strong anti-money-laundering provisions and ensuring that risks are protected, while at the same time creating the openness mobile banking needs to develop to reach the broader population. Banks using the old branch and head office structure do not have the cost profile for bringing banks to rural regions. We have no choice but to change that model and the regulations so that mobile money can be used by the population.</p><h4>Regulation and government policy has been a major concern for foreign investors. What is your opinion of the fine imposed on the MTN in the context of doing business in Nigeria?</h4><p>The only thing worse than having too much regulation is no regulation at all. If there are no regulations, the business environment is not fair. If regulations are to be effective and taken seriously, strict sanctions will have to be applied for violation of rules and laws.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Etisalat, subject to the government taking action to ensure that there are fair competition rules, which have not been fair up to now, will have a good year. For Nigeria, I expect that in 2016 the government will begin to get a grip on some of the key problems facing the nation. It will be difficult for them to achieve a turnaround in the space of 12 months, so people should be realistic with their expectations. Next year will be challenging, but by 2017-18, we will begin to see the consequences of some of the key decisions they will take in 2016, and I expect that those will be positive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the NCC encouraging private sector investment in broadband?</h4><p>The growth of broadband in the country has been a critical area of focus for the NCC in the last few years. The impact of broadband penetration on economies across the world has been empirically proven. The Commission articulated a new broadband infrastructure framework called the Open Access Framework to facilitate the rapid deployment of broadband infrastructure across the country. Under this framework, the country has been divided into seven licensing areas, where each area will have a licensed Infrastructure Company (InfraCo). This is meant to support such strategic initiatives as accelerating the deployment of metropolitan broadband infrastructure across the country that is currently inadequate, successfully conducting licensing for the Lagos and North Central zones, licensing several retail service providers like ISPs to drive broadband delivery to subscribers, transparent auctions of one slot of 30 MHz bandwidth in the 2.3 GHz spectrum band on a wholesale basis to provide the required infrastructure for RSPs for the delivery of broadband services to customers, and encouraging the deployment of 3G Mobile broadband services in every state across the country. The impact of this can be seen in the exponential growth of subscribers with internet access from about 30.9 million in December 2012 to about 97 million in September 2015. The NCC is also effectively engaging with bodies like the Nigeria Governors Forum to address the issues negatively impacting investment in broadband infrastructure across the country, such as Right of Way charges, as well as streamlining taxes and fees required for the deployment of critical telecommunications infrastructure. </p><h4>How do you plan to raise the level of telecommunications service across Nigeria?</h4><p>We actively monitor technical factors to maintain service delivery at a high standard. We are also looking at non-technical factors in terms of improving overall service. Operators are subjected to multiple taxations at the level of federal, state, and local government, as well as sometimes even at the global level. There is also denial of the right of way for the deployment of fiber cables, sabotage of critical telecommunications infrastructure, and the issue of power supply. There is a bill in the National Assembly that will make the telecommunications infrastructure a critical infrastructure, the sabotage of which will become a serious national offense. We are also urging the government to implement a document on levies, multiple levies, taxation, and other issues. This will grant infrastructure companies unfettered access to sites and locations for the deployment of broadband infrastructure. Looking ahead, if and when they do accept this, and broadband services are deployed, the taxes they will generate from these services will easily warrant the initiative.</p><h4>What initiatives will drive growth in the future?</h4><p>Broadband will transform the economy and the way things are being done, perhaps on par with the transformative effects of electricity distribution. Broadband will determine the socioeconomic development of every country in the 21st century. The Nigerian government has therefore created a national broadband plan, which is envisioned to contribute up to 1.3% to GDP. Broadband will also enable the rollout of services that will benefit both the urban and rural population. The NCC has been assigned the responsibility of licensing infrastructure companies that will provide broadband infrastructure. That process has started with two licenses already issued; Mainone was licensed for Lagos, while another infrastructure company has been given the license to deploy Wi-Fi infrastructure in the North Central zone, where Abuja is located. There are five more zones to license. As soon as we have deployed the necessary technology to facilitate the rollout of broadband services, then the operators will be licensed and the spectra will be provided. We will have achieved the two main milestones of installing a mostly fiber broadband infrastructure in every major city and all rural areas across the country, and successfully auctioning the broadband spectra. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have attitudes and approaches to doing business in Nigeria changed over the years?</h4><p>The main change has been getting people to embrace alternatives. In the past, for example, the private market system was quite difficult to navigate. There were also various political difficulties, including military governments. However, in the last decade we have embraced privatization and focused on developing the private sector. Regulations have been created to engender this environment, but we are still not completely there yet. There is now a different profile of people entering the private sector, as people are younger and ready to embrace new ideas, innovations, and technologies, as well as a new kind of business ethic. When we have a critical mass of these people in the economy, the future will be wide open, and that is where we are headed. Unfortunately, due to the oil industry, we have had a mentality of entitlement. But these people are on the way out, and the new paradigm is a commitment to hard work, industriousness, and creating value rather than just grabbing what is there. Things are changing for the better, and that is why I am optimistic about Nigeria's future. </p><h4>In 1991, when you started with Diamond Bank, what opportunities did you see in the sector that led you to create Diamond Bank?</h4><p>When we started, the banking industry was quite underdeveloped. It would take hours of waiting to just cash a check or deposit money at the bank. There were no functioning telecommunications services. Cashing a check or transferring money was an ordeal. The question was how to improve and add value to the banking sector. The problem was obvious, and a solution was needed. Applying technologies that allowed for electronic banking was inevitable. We had to improve the system of fund transfers and reduce transaction times for businesses, which is what we did. We introduced electronic fund transfers and the first debit cards. Instead of physically carrying cash from here to there, customers could do it all electronically. Now we have full mobile services, from transferring money to checking a balance. So we have been on the forefront of technological innovations, and continue to be, because that is where we saw the opportunity and the demand to increase value in the banking system and in people's lives in general, be they the average person or businessmen. This also brought about innovations in security and data. These innovations have created greater financial inclusion. </p><h4>What do you think needs to be done on the part of the government to increase banking penetration in Nigeria and integrate telecom and financial services?</h4><p>We need to be a little bit more daring in a sense. Regulators want to maintain system stability, but this can delay necessary changes and innovations. They are afraid the telecoms would drive the system rather than the banks. The Central Bank would want this system to be bank initiated rather than by telecoms. If it were the other way around, the Central Bank would not be completely in charge, and this does not appeal to them. Secondly, there is a lot of money out there, but we have to be bolder in terms of which money we use without being reckless, without leading to inflation. </p><h4>What are your expectations for Nigeria in 2016?</h4><p>The president has the right political will and leadership qualities. He has the commitment and the determination to push the policies that need to be implemented. I am hopeful for the government and the ministers that have taken office. But the president will only be as successful as his cabinet and the extent to which they can work together to take bold decisions and do what needs to be done. Success belongs to everybody and nobody, that is what the president said when he was sworn into office. The price of oil being down is one of the best things that has happened to this country. Our agriculture sector has potential, yet what percentage of arable land have we utilized, and what percentage of water resources have we utilized? What of mineral resources? All our attention has been on oil. Hopefully the drop in oil prices will enable us to focus on developing other sectors where growth and future opportunities lie. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Fundamental Concerns]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[fundamental-concerns]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Bank of Industry is a driver of the country's diversification away from hydrocarbons. What has the bank done recently to enhance its role in this respect?</h4><p>Our mission in Nigeria is to transform the industrial sector, while our greater vision is to become a significant development bank in Africa. The only area where we have not performed well until last year was SME financing. We are concentrating our efforts more on enhancing SME financing. We have not abandoned our focus on larger enterprises, like Coleman Cables and Wires; rather we have expanded to also serve SMEs, which are the engine of developed and developing economies. We believe in the importance of helping small businesses access finance to help them grow into the major players of the future. Supporting SMEs is our passion at the Bank of Industry, while financing industrial development remains our core competency. </p><h4>What are your strategies for supporting industrial development and diversification in Nigeria, and which industrial segments stand out in your overall strategy? </h4><p>Our industrial sector activity is driven by what we call commodity-based industrialization. Our approach is to use what is available in order to reach our goals. Nigeria has a lot of agricultural resources, so one of our areas of focus is on agro-processing. We look for ways to develop value-added products from some of Nigeria's most malleable agricultural resources, such as cocoa, cassava, and tomatoes. There are also more than 40 different types of solid minerals available at commercial quantities in Nigeria. This is a potential boom market, given the continued decline in the price of oil.</p><h4>Considering declining commodity prices, do you see a particular opportunity for diversification in Nigeria in which the government itself is taking a significant role?</h4><p>This is not just an opportunity for diversification, but it is crucial. We cannot afford to make the same mistakes that we have in the past. The price of oil falling below $10 in 1986 prompted discussions of diversification, but that proved to be just talk. Every time the price of oil drops, the same topic comes up. Now, however, we are creating concrete plans and taking action. Leveraging agriculture is important for diversification, but we need to go beyond primary agriculture and move into secondary agro-processing as well. The same is true with our other core client sectors.</p><h4>The Nigerian film industry is one of the biggest in the world. How does that play a part in Nigeria's overall economic growth and what potential do you see there?</h4><p>The Nigerian film industry has grown tremendously, and it is now the third biggest producer of movies in the world. It now produces more movies than Hollywood and has achieved this growth largely without any government support. As a development bank, we want to also help develop the film industry through financial support. There is a new crop of individuals in this sector who are beginning to look at setting their standards of production based on international quality, taste, and markets. We set up the Nolly Fund, through which we target the top ten movie producers, the so-called New Nollywood. These are people who can produce international quality films, like Half of a Yellow Sun, 30 Days in Atlanta, or Octoberfest, and we want to back these companies fully.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>The budget for 2016 should be approved early in the year so that priority projects can receive the proper attention they need. The NNPC reforms will continue, and hopefully these tides of change carry over into customs regulations as well as our tax administration system. These institutional reforms will hopefully happen next year. The Bank of Industry has also undergone certain reforms. One of the first things I did after being appointed to this position was to benchmark BOI against BNDES in Brazil, the Small Business Development Bank in India, the SME Bank of Malaysia, and the Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) of South Africa in order to figure out what these banks were doing more effectively than we were in Nigeria. We have upgraded our banking application to a more robust model, and our website is more informative. We received an AA+ national rating from Fitch in June, and we are now working with Moody's to get an international rating from them as well. Our vision is not just to be the most impactful financial institution in Africa, but to do so by adhering to global best practices of operating transparency. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Dangote Cement's profits rose 28% in 1H2015 despite a weakening macro-environment. What drove those strong results?</h4><p>The collapse in oil prices, the devaluation of the naira, the uncertainties around the national elections, the continuing insurgency in the North East, disruptions in petroleum products supplies, and continued import dependence of the economy for many basic necessities have all negatively impacted consumer spending power and behavior. This led to a decrease in sales volumes in our home market. Despite all the above challenges, our strong results can be attributed mainly to the increased diversity of our business. Our cement sales volume increased by 13.7% YoY, with 22% of the volumes sold coming from Senegal and Cameroon, and Sephaku Cement, Ethiopia, and Zambia. Our strategy has been to enter new markets with a higher-quality product produced at lower-cost factories, and as a result we are rapidly gaining market shares in key African markets, in spite of well-established competition. Nevertheless, despite the reduction in sales volumes in the country, revenue from our Nigerian operations rose by 2.7%. This was due in large part to increases in average selling prices, at about 11%, and improvements in the energy mix.</p><h4>One of Dangote's most important projects—Nigeria's first full-scale privately-owned domestic refinery—just received a near $1 billion dollar grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) for the development of human resources; how will this project change the economic status quo in Nigeria?</h4><p>Nigeria's economy is heavily dependent on oil revenue, which makes it vulnerable to fluctuating crude oil prices. Nigeria is one of the world's largest producers and exporters of crude oil, yet due to our low refinery utilization rate, we are one of the largest importers of refined petroleum products. This opportunity and challenge was a major driver in my decision to embark on the $9 billion, 650,000bopd refinery project. The generous grant from USTDA will provide essential training of the critical human capital needed for this extremely technical project, particularly given that this has previously been a largely inactive sector with little to no opportunities to build up the necessary practical skills. The project will eliminate Nigeria's dependence on foreign refined petroleum products and therefore reduce costs of all goods and services. The government subsidy on imported petroleum products is under review and is unsustainable in the longer term. Resources freed up from this expense will ensure that more export revenues are used in-country to fund government projects like infrastructure, power, and education.</p><h4>How are plans progressing to list Dangote Cement on the London and Johannesburg stock exchanges, and what impact do you expect it to have on the company's operations?</h4><p>A listing on either the LSE or the JSE, or both, remains a vital component of our vision for DCP. These listings will potentially fund further growth from a pan-African firm to a truly global cement powerhouse, as they could allow us to continue to raise capital from new, deeper sources at more competitive rates. Shares on the JSE and LSE are traded by a wide array of institutional and professional investors that would further diversify our existing investor base. In addition, Western individual and institutional investors are continuously looking for ways to engage in the African consumer growth story, from which we have benefited greatly. These listings would allow for that broader participation and would drive awareness to the global public about our firm and what we have built thus far. However, when it comes to public exchange listings, timing is of the utmost importance, regardless of the strength of a firm's fundamentals. Thus, given the negative sentiment around and the perceived risk of investing in Nigeria and Africa today, we are not in a hurry to go to market just yet.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>It is difficult to predict what will happen in the coming year, given the fluid nature of regional and global developments, but projections for 2016 from various sources suggest that the global economy will rebound slightly next year after the slow-down experienced in 2015. Across Africa, a number of countries like Nigeria and Zambia that are historically resource-dependent will likely continue to face the after effects of lower commodity prices. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Eko was privatized along with the rest of the distribution sector in 2013. What has changed since the company was privatized? </h4><p>When we took over in 2013, the network was dilapidated due to inadequate investment. Up to that point, the sector was under government control, and had not seen the investment it required for over 30 years. When we took over, we had to evaluate the network and assets that we purchased as prior to privatization, investors had lacked this opportunity. Our evaluation was in essence like a black box, revealing the poor condition of existing infrastructure. We quickly raised $250 million to ramp up the existing network to such that we could distribute electricity to our customers. When we looked at the total customer outlay, it turned out that 50% lacked meters, and among the other 50%, meters were obsolete, or not in working order. We are now investing in meters with a clear focus on the customer, who does not favor estimated billing. This year, Eko is spending over NGN20 billion on meters alone to replace the entire system for its 400,000 customers. We also have high-consuming industrial and commercial customers, numbering around 6,000-7,000. Those entities consume over 40% of our energy and, paying more, are the current focus of our metering efforts. We want to make sure that no one is cheating the other, and that everyone has a functional meter that they are comfortable with. This way, whatever bill we give our customers, they will be satisfied with.</p><h4>How has gas supply affected your distribution efforts?</h4><p>We are not getting enough power from the grid because of an inadequate gas supply to the generators, brought about because of vandalism to the gas pipeline, which has reduced the level of generation throughout the country. Also, the cost of gas for power generation is low compared with gas sold to the rest of the market. Gas suppliers naturally favor higher price bracket customers. The government has moved on this, having increased the cost of gas per unit. It is ready to supply gas if the pipelines are renovated. And as far as the grid is concerned, there is a sharing formula where everybody gets a percentage of what is generated. For instance, at Eko, we have 11% of whatever is generated on to the grid. What we require today is a minimum of 700MW. But we only receive on average 300MW, or even below 200MW. For a number of months we have received a daily allocation in the morning of not above 300MW. Our supply tends to dwindle in the afternoon, as there is insufficient gas for the generators. We allocate based on what is available to us, but Eko cannot continue to operate like this, and is seeking a complimentary source of power for its network. Now, we are encouraging private companies to set up generation plants, the output of which would be sold to us for addition to what is available on the existing grid. Such embedded power is not subject to grid intervention. We have been working on this for almost nine months now. A total of 43 companies have indicated a willingness to set up plants of various capacities and in assorted locations. These companies should provide an additional 400MW, though it will be gradual process as equipment needs to be received and installed. Currently, Eko has almost completed a bilateral power agreement with existing power plants that are not tied to direct agreements. We have almost concluded an agreement for an additional 100MW, which will probably materialize before June. Secondly, a further three companies have 40MW ready for supply once all MoUs are signed. In total this year we are looking at an extra 170MW. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Total has a long history in Nigeria. How have your activities in the country evolved?</h4><p>Total's history in Nigeria has been one of continuous development. We produced our first oil onshore from OML 58 block in 1966 and then moved into offshore developments, first in shallow waters with the Ofon and Amenam projects and then in the deepwater area with the development of Akpo field in 2009, followed by Usan in 2012 and now Egina. Today, Total has a broad and diversified portfolio in Nigeria, with activities spanning conventional onshore and offshore, deepwater, and LNG. Overall, Total is present in more than 30 production and exploration licenses, either as operator, technical advisor, or partner. Over the years, we have developed a strong partnership with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Today, we operate four concessions in joint venture with the NNPC, both onshore and offshore, and we also operate the OML 130 deepwater concession, which contains the Akpo and Egina fields as well as the Preowei discovery. As partner, Total holds interests in the acreage operated by Shell Petroleum Development of Nigeria (SPDC), in offshore blocks OML118 and OML135 operated by Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCO), and in several licenses in partnership with Nigerian companies, including Conoil, Amni and Emo. We also hold a 15% interest in the Nigeria LNG liquefaction plant on Bonny Island. Last but not least, Total has also a significant presence in the downstream sector in Nigeria, through Total Nigeria Plc, a leader in the downstream sector of the Nigerian oil and gas industry with an extensive distribution network of over 500 service stations nationwide and a wide range of top quality energy products and services. </p><h4>What is the status of the Egina field amid lower oil prices and what does it represent for Total in Nigeria?</h4><p>Egina is the largest upstream project under development in Nigeria right now, undertaken by Total and its partners Sapetro, Petrobras, CNNOC and CNPC. It is also one of Total's largest operated projects worldwide. Egina involves the development of approximately 550 million barrels of oil in water depths ranging from 1,500 to 1,700 meters. The project is currently about 40% complete and production is scheduled to start in 2018 to reach a plateau at 200,000 barrels per day. Egina is a complex project that requires the integration of many different components. It also involves a very significant Nigerian content, on a much larger scale than previous deepwater projects. For instance, we developed a yard from scratch in Lagos to fabricate and install FPSO modules. When completed, some 21 million hours of work, representing 75% of the total project man-hours, will have been performed locally and 60,000 tons of equipment will have been fabricated in Nigeria. </p><h4>What trends will define the future of the industry moving forward?</h4><p>In the future, we can expect that the mainstay of Total's growth in Nigeria will come from deep-offshore and gas. There is a large potential market for gas in Nigeria, mostly for power generation, and there is a willingness of the government to develop the domestic gas market. Total is fully engaged in this process. Together with the NNPC, we are completing two gas pipeline projects, designed to supply the domestic market from our OML 58 production facility. One is the OUR pipeline between Obagi and Rumuekpe and the other is the NOPL pipeline to supply the Alaoji power plant. We are not investors in the power generation sector in Nigeria. Our focus is rather to bring gas to the domestic market, by making the necessary investments in the upstream production facilities and in pipeline facilities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How are the depressed oil prices playing out in your sector?</h4><p>International oil companies have called on us to push down our rates between 10-30%. We have had to made cutbacks on projects and a lot of projects have been downsized or canceled. On our part, we are trying to strategize and have a new way to cope with some of these new challenges impacting our business. However, the Local Content Act has done a lot for us in pushing our business forward. It has given us leverage with companies who now have to consider us as an option. In the past, most companies were dealing with foreign firms, so it was difficult for Nigerian companies that owned their own vessels. Since the act was passed, we have been considered for local company bids ahead of the multinational companies. The downward pressure of declining oil prices makes having a optimum technical capabilities all the more necessary, but it is difficult for us to make proposals for our strategic direction moving forward new at the moment until some of the new governmental elements are in place. Rather than renting a full drilling rig that could take on some of the completion of new projects, we plan to adopt new technology first for smaller rigs to reduce costs and expand from there.</p><h4>The board of NNPC has been revamped—where does that leave the industry in relation to the mix of local and international talent?</h4><p>The changes in the board is a positive development because the best way to run a business is to be transparent. This government is moving in the right direction, they have been proactive and the new GMD is focused on change. Coming from Exxon Mobil, Kachikwu brought a lot of experience to the table; he understands the industry from the IOC perspective. He is coming on board with great quality, so the shakeup is a move in the right direction. One of the challenges has always been human capital; young graduates often change jobs after receiving intensive company training. In addition transparency matters, this instability in human capital presents a serious challenge for the industry. I am an advocate for indigenous companies coming together to synergize. Five or six companies come together to execute a common project by sharing personnel, equipment, and resources, thereby reducing the overall burden. It is important that as we create a drive for local content and create synergy between Nigerian companies and foreign players. In this way, we will be better able to deliver world-class projects. Our focus is to bring companies together that have good quality records, a good image, well-developed human capital, and good technical competence that can grow more in capacity together. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016?</h4><p>We anticipate a good year overall, but it is going to be slow in the first months of 2016. We are working for NPDC oil intervention and are still looking at Chevron for some of the assets on the swamp, because the swamp is going to reopen again. We would also like to get involved with the Shell Bonga project once that site comes on board. Most companies have slashed their budgets, but they will pick up gradually. Companies who know what they are doing will persevere—it is a matter of having a successful business model and organizational structure. There was a time when oil sold for $10 a barrel in this country and we still got through it, so it is a question of the country being aligned with global actions and ensuring that the economic policy is suited for the conditions we face. Nigerian oil companies' revenues will grow, but the country should begin to look at diversifying away from oil and gas. There is a lot of money in agriculture and other sectors. By contrast, Norway has not touched one dollar of the revenues they have earned from oil and gas over the last 40 years; that money is kept in an account. We need to start doing serious diversification right now so that we can have set aside resources for future investments, when the economy will rely on other sectors in addition to oil and gas. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Cratos Group has grown quickly to cover energy, defense, agriculture, and infrastructure. What motivated your entry into these particular areas?</h4><p>I grew up with my father and worked in his construction company. When I left military service I started my own construction firm, which was small to begin with. Later, I began marketing diesel and petrol, and the idea for Cratos Energy was born. When it became successful, we diversified into defense and agriculture. Recently, we have been looking at agriculture, because of dwindling oil prices, and this administration is focusing on it. We have about partnering with a Canadian company called Agri-Trend, and we are going to be coaching Nigerian farmers about managing their crops and using modern technology to achieve high yields. We have also partnered with an agriculture-focused private equity firm and will be searching for deals on their behalf.</p><h4>How has your energy business developed today and where do you stand?</h4><p>Right now, Cratos Energy is partnered with BP International. We are a registered trademark, and have its full support on finance and trading. We have traded fuel oil cargo over the years. We were part of Synergia and we traded about $600-700 million worth of crude cargo. We also have a partnership with a refinery in Kosovo. These partnerships have helped us grow over the years and we have acquired a lot of experience along the way. We want to venture into the upstream sector now, and also into services. We are looking at going into drilling oil wells and the laying pipelines for IOC's and the government. </p><h4>As the government focuses on diversification, what opportunities do you see in the energy sector in the face of dropping oil prices?</h4><p>We saw an opportunity here and have partnered with a company from Arizona called Zhro, which markets a gas capture technology aimed at gas flaring. It can convert it into 98% pure methane, which can be used to run the facilities in the place of diesel, making it more cost effective. This methane can also be exported. If you look at Nigeria as a whole it is gas heavy, the only thing we need to do is develop our capabilities. </p><h4>What effect has the peaceful political transition had on your prospects thus far, considering your position in Nigeria?</h4><p>The electoral outcome was just short of a miracle. Because of the peaceful transition, international companies have more confidence in Nigeria. There was also a ripple effect where state governments lost the election and congratulated their counterparts, such things have never happened before. The peaceful transition alone had a positive impact on the businesses, as some investors have been monitoring the situation for the last couple of years, waiting what would happen in 2015. </p><h4>What services do you provide to the defense industry in Nigeria, and how have you developed it?</h4><p>We recruited some ex-special forces from the SAS in Britain and ex-Navy Seals from the US. We are working on special tailored programs for the Nigerian forces. We have also worked on a number of sensitive cases that have had a positive impact in the fight against insurgency. </p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I expect 2016 to be a great year. This coming administration is by the book, so if you know what you are doing you will get the job done. Many people are now interested in investing because of the zero tolerance to corruption. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have lower oil prices affected your business?</h4><p>The effect on LADOL of the fallen—or rather, corrected—oil price has been positive. What happens when the oil price is too high—and I think that over $100 is too high—is that inefficiency and rent-seeking increase, and many agents enter the market that are not adding value. When the oil price corrects, people look to optimize their business strategy, and optimization requires transparency and making wise economic decisions. Fortunately for the oil companies, this correction has come at a time when we have seen unprecedented levels of credible private sector investment in the Nigerian oil and gas industry from indigenous companies like LADOL. We have invested in facilities, equipment, and people, which lower the cost of doing business and also align interests between the oil companies, indigenous private sector and the public sector—enabling them all to contribute positively to their bottom lines while significantly and sustainably boosting the economy. We are making these investments at a time when oil companies need to rationalize their operations, and they are finding that their ability to do so has been significantly increased by developers such as LADOL. It is a win-win situation.</p><h4>You are building the first domestically constructed FSPO. What is the time line for that project?</h4><p>We are expecting the FPSO to come into LADOL sometime in the next 12 months. The FPSO has been partially built and integrated in South Korea and it will be finished off at Ladol. However, for subsequent projects, what we are targeting is a 50:50 situations, moving toward 70% local content, hopefully within the next 10 years. This is a gradual process that has been initiated by the construction and operation of this facility. The damage done to our economy by not having FPSOs integrated onshore in Nigeria is vastly underestimated. This new facility is a real game-changer. If you are spending tens of billions of dollars developing a new oil block and the key components never touch land in your own country, local content is never going to be more than 5-10%, and even that 5-10% will not be creating sustainable jobs. Hosting the FPSO in Nigeria means that we are now telling all companies involved in the development that they must set up significant operations in Nigeria. When people start to do that, they think about what makes sense in the medium-to-long term. This is about returning the market to sanity and long-term growth. Every country that has successfully deployed a local content strategy has reduced the cost of oil and gas in that country, both on the development and on the operational sides. </p><h4>What is your opinion of the PIB restructuring and attracting new investment?</h4><p>The PIB was becoming a red herring. It was something that nobody understood, yet it was being used as an excuse for not making billions of dollars of investments. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) needs to be restructured into some sort of private organization that has its functions split between the business of being an oil and gas company and the functions it has as an industry regulator, similar to what happened with PETROBRAS. It does not require a petroleum industry bill to do that. Those changes need to happen, one way or another; they will benefit the oil companies and Nigeria. Breaking it up into smaller pieces of legislation would make it easier to pass and we hope this will happen. Nonetheless our main wish is that the government finds a way to make it less of an issue by making moves now to increase transparency and privatize some of the JVs and PSCs—in essence replicating the NLNG model that has been successful. While we have been debating the PIB, people should not forget that Total invested in three new offshore blocks, and Shell has made it clear that they are prepared to go ahead with Bonga South West irrespective of the PIB. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What opportunities did you identify in the energy sector in Nigeria when you entered the market?</h4><p>I graduated in Petroleum Engineering in 1980 and having worked for two US oil companies—Kerr-McGee and Texaco—and gained valuable experience. I decided to foray into the Nigerian business environment in 1988 because at that time opportunities existed for Nigerians to get into the oil and gas sector. The PAI Group was, therefore, conceptualized in 1989 primarily as a procurement company of which we were agents for the US based safety shoe manufacturing company Red Wings. After five years, the company evolved into a service support company for internationally renowned companies with interest in Nigeria. The portfolio of 12 companies ranged from FMC, SOFEC, Samsung Heavy Industries, Air-Logistics, Dateline Services, LTT, Tubing Testers, and a host of others. PAI, therefore, became the local strategic partner to these international service companies providing local infrastructures, human resources and business support.</p><p>Approximately five years later with the experience gained, PAI forayed into acquisition and in 2000 acquired Transcoastal, a US-based company with operations in Nigeria in the fabrication and offshore construction business. The company was awarded a three-year fabrication contract by Chevron and successfully fabricated four offshore platforms and five helidecks of which we are proud to say those platforms are still producing oil offshore here in Nigeria. </p><p>Without a doubt Transcostal prides itself as the trailblazer of Nigeria content, of which the Nigeria Content Act was passed into law in 2012.</p><p>PAI moved into another acquisition when we bought the internationally recognized pipe coating company Bredero Price based in Nigeria, which we grew significantly. We have continued on an acquisition spree and recently concluded the acquisition of Ascot, which is a well-known company with the largest fabrication yards in West Africa with capabilities for offshore construction, marine fleet, heavy equipment, pipe coating plants, and calm buoy docks within the facility. This facility has the ability to fabricate heavy structures up to 10,000 tons. </p><h4>What do you plan to do with the Ascot facilities?</h4><p>There is significant potential with Ascot. The facility has the ability to build offshore platforms and decks including calm buoys. We are in dialogue with various international partners in their areas of expertise where we have the infrastructure to support them. The facility will offer minimal entry costs for these companies because we have a functional base. We have pipe coating, a marine division, a dredging division, and we also have the ability to do onshore pipeline construction as well. That facility, therefore, covers the entire spectrum of our construction business. We are looking for more international partners to develop strategic relationships in order to grow into a  full EPICC company of choice in Nigeria.</p><h4>How have your foreign partners reacted to the new Buhari administration?</h4><p>The reaction is positive, because they could see that there is a serious sense of purpose from the present administration; however, there was also the cautiousness that is expected during the infancy stage of a government. It is early days. Now that ministers have portfolios, policies will start coming into place and that will start driving the economy—2016 will be a much better year, and a defining moment for the new administration.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016 in terms of your business and the country as a whole?</h4><p>Since Nigeria's economy is dependent on oil, it is a sticky situation. If oil prices increase, it would be a good thing for the country; however, if the prices stay as-is, the country will have to stay with conservative policies. The administration has come in to try to cut excess costs, which will help save money for the country, but if oil prices stay at the same levels, it will be difficult for them to go into robust projects and fund change. Also, the fiscal policies have not yet been cast, but if they are a lot more lenient and liberal, that will attract investors. For the oil and gas industry, this is a time for injecting creativity into project execution with the aim of cutting cost; that is the motto and goal of our company at this time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You signed a 12“ pipeline joint-venture agreement that you hoped would increase the amount of exported crude and curb theft. How is that progressing? </h4><p>We have since completed the project with our partner, and it has been in operation since November 2014. This has helped increase total volume injection, but it is not a solution to vandalism, being exposed to the same environment. There have already been sabotage attempts on the new line. We are hoping the new government can address that soon. If we share our crude through the refinery, we will reduce our losses.</p><h4>In the broader spectrum of indigenous companies operating in Nigeria, what developments have there been over the past year, and what has been the impact of your efforts?</h4><p>Since the marginal field auctions took place in 2003, room has opened up for Nigerians to participate. Previously, we had all been staff or managers at the IOCs, apart from one or two independents. It was the domain of Shell, Chevron, and the like, while today many more Nigerians have become involved. Then, the divestments came in on top of the marginal fields, and together, those factors have increased the production volume of the Nigerian independents. Shell has almost given up its onshore assets and I believe it wants to focus on gas and the larger deep off-shore prospective asset. For Energia, we have been able to create a strong presence. We are emotionally, mentally, and technically ready to play on the next level. </p><h4>How has the goal of 15,000 bpd set last year progressed, and how has the decline in oil prices affected your targets and the price of assets?</h4><p>The game has changed considerably, and we have ceased drilling as the margin between the costs of operation and the crude price became too wide. The industry is not yet properly indexed, so when the price of crude drops, it is not immediately reflected in the service cost. Contracts change over time. We chose to meet with our partners and to maintain production at 9,000 barrels. Hopefully, drilling will start later in 2015. Someone has to close the spigots at OPEC because members are already suffering. Pressure on Saudi Arabia is growing. Energia has stopped drilling, although it is more accurate to say that we have stopped exploring, because we drill to maintain production. We now have to drill better, cheaper, faster, and more efficiently so that our costs reflect prevailing low prices. In an environment of low prices one has to focus on efficiency. The industry doesn't slow down when prices are low. At $50 per barrel, we still drill. Energia is on the progressive side, and we cannot wait endlessly for crude prices to reach $100 per barrel before we resume drilling; we shall pick up the rig once we see a fairly stable price, even at $50 per barrel. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the energy sector next year?</h4><p>In Nigeria, we will be busy. By this time next year, we will be open to a lot of divestment. The marginal field round, which was suspended, will be back on the table. We will be aggressively participating to be part of the block put on sale to Chevron and Shell because we are ready to move to the next level. We will be busy with the foundation work of our refinery, drilling and increasing production with our current assets. There will be a lot of restructuring in the country. The election has given us a good rating internationally, and now we are a democratic society. Nigeria is a credible country. Energia is ready to take advantage of the opportunities set to materialize next year. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell us about the OB3 project?</h4><p>The Obiafu/Obrikom-Oben Project also, known as the OB3 Project, is the largest gas pipeline ever constructed in Nigeria. It involves the construction of a major gas pipeline of 48“ diameter for NNPC by Nestoil. The pipeline runs from Obrikom in Rivers state to Oben in Edo state, passing through many rivers including River Niger which it crosses at 3km width. The terminal point is in Edo State, where it connects to the Escravos Lagos Pipeline System (ELPS). The OB3 project is an integral part of the Nigerian Gas Master Plan, which has three pipelines, namely the OB3, the CAP, and the AKK.  This will be Nigeria's first natural gas pipeline of this kind and will support the growth of the country's power industry.  The OB3 pipeline project's scope includes the engineering, procurement, and construction of a 48“ x 127 km class 600 gas supply pipeline project starting from Obiafu/Obrikom (OB/OB) in Rivers State, and terminating at Oben, in Edo State. The OB3 Gas Supply Pipeline System is designed to process and transport 2 billion cubic feet (bcf) per day of natural gas from OB/OB in Rivers State to Oben in Edo State with associated Custody Transfer Metering Station facilities at OB/OB and a Terminal Gas Station at the Oben Node in Edo State. An intermediate Pigging Station is located at Umukwata, Delta State at the midpoint of the pipeline. The entire scope of the project was divided into two tranches namely, Lot A and Lot B; Nestoil Limited was awarded the Lot A scope, which includes the most challenging terrain on the project's Right of Way. The scope of the Lot A tranche covers approximately 64.7km of pipeline. The project is fully on course. The OB3 is the first pipeline project in Nigeria to involve the use of 48 inch pipelines.</p><h4>What returns are you expecting from these investments particularly the OML42 asset?</h4><p>Our exploration and production portfolio also has substantial oil and gas resources, and we intend to drill for more oil and gas from these fields. Neconde owns 45% interest in the OML 42 Asset while the government as our JV partner owns 55% interest. This asset presently produces 42,000 bpd with a potential to produce up to 200,000 bpd. We are already investing towards this by rebuilding the vandalized facilities, constructing pipelines and preparing to drill more wells.  We are projecting that by the end of 2016. We should have reached a production capacity of over 100,000 bpd, making Neconde the biggest local producer in Nigeria. In addition to an increase in oil production, the OML 42 gas investments have the capacity to deliver up to 500 million cubic feet of gas per day to the domestic market and support more than 1,300MW of electricity generation.  </p><h4>Could you tell us about your dry dock facility in Port Harcourt?</h4><p>We own a new build shipyard that is equipped with a Floating Drydock located on our 59 ha Industrial Area in Abuloma, Port Harcourt.  This modern facility was designed and built by Damen Shipyards Holland and meets highest international standards.  It is equipped with a 5,000 tonnage floating drydock, 14,000sqm of modern repair facilities, an office space of 1,600sqm and a quayside length of 1,300sqm.  With our highly qualified and continuously trained team, our Shipside Drydock offers a wide range of services in the repairing, overhauling, maintenance, refurbishing and upgrading of ships with its machineries and propulsions. We run 24-hour operations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Has the current oil price environment affected your appetite for assets?</h4><p>I would like to expand my purchase program to take advantage of the current low prices. The unfortunate part of the divestment strategy was that it was not coordinated. We observed a large-scale dumping of assets in the market, but stiff competition among local firms drove up prices. I would argue that the banks need to show more patience and realize that assets were purchased at $110, while today oil is much less, whereby companies will require more time to repay the banks. I see the IOCs that are present now are coming down, and then hopefully by 2016, we will have a reasonable pricing regime on this last wave of divestments.</p><h4>You are also the President of the Nigerian Association of Indigenous Petroleum Explorers and Producers. How is that association impacting indigenous companies here?</h4><p>It is having an impact, but not as considerable a one as I would wish for. This association is not competing with the IOCs, which in any case enjoy a closer dialogue with the government than we do. We seem to be taking care of our issues on a one-on-one basis, while the IOCs approach as one voice, which seems to carry further than ours. The members of the Association are currently producing 10-15% of Nigerian crude oil. As our importance grows and as we unite our voices, our position will also grow and strengthen. With a growth in political relevance comes advance knowledge of government policies enabling us to grasp in a timely manner the potential impact of those policies on our businesses. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB)?</h4><p>I expect it to be ratified. As things stand, we are losing investments into other environments and our slogan of 10 years ago of 40 million barrels is nowhere near to being realized. Those with the financial resources on hand are not going to invest here unless they know the terms to be enacted. In that light, I believe it to be in our best interest to forget political partisanship, because the draft bill is better than no bill at all. I expect the new congress to pass the bill. </p><h4>Will your activities to create an association of indigenous producers have a wider impact and provide a stronger voice for future policy decisions?</h4><p>As indigenous companies grow stronger, they are more confident in seeking government attention. Today, we are unfortunately rather more like servants telling their boss what they require. Yet, when our feet are under the same table we are more confidence of voicing our ideas. In short, as we grow in scale, we will be able to have more of an impact on policy making.  </p><h4>What is Amni's outlook for the year ahead?</h4><p>This will be a year of assessment in terms of what we have on hand, and how we can increase its value. I do not foresee oil prices rising above $65 a barrel this year, but in terms of managing this portfolio, it is not that a bad price. We will pursue two projects this year. We will try and conclude the Okoro developments and also try and get going on the IMA. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What regulatory changes are crucial to motivate better usage of the nation's natural gas resources?</h4><p>With the crude flux, gas is the current topic of conversation. Recent developments in the gas and power sector such as the privatization of power assets, the upward review of gas-to-power prices, and the review of energy tariffs demonstrate the positive and important changes being witnessed in the sector and is an indication of the long-term direction of the gas sector.  The ready and ever-growing domestic power demand also provides a platform to guarantee a vibrant future for the gas sector, and government has also introduced various incentives to benefit investors in both sectors. While the government has performed well in providing fiscal incentives for gas producers, there is room for improvement. The recent upward review of the gas-to-power pricing is key and will play a significant role in ensuring that investments in the upstream gas sector develop infrastructure to enable monetization efforts and process gas to acceptable specifications. The Central Bank is also playing an increasingly active role in ensuring that priority is given to the development of the gas sector. Nigeria has all it takes to emerge as a regional gas hub, serving both regional and international markets. The eagerness of Europe to diversify its gas sources also offers a unique opportunity for Nigeria, which has the eighth largest proven natural gas reserves in the world, to play a significant long-term role in the global energy market.</p><h4>Oando acquired ConocoPhillips' Nigerian business in 2014 for $1.5 billion, and in July 2015 it sold 60% of its downstream business for $276 million to the Helios-Vitol Group. What do these moves indicate about your long-term strategy? </h4><p>We are an integrated energy company with investments across the entire energy value chain in downstream, midstream, and upstream operations. The company is focused on growing within the higher margin upstream sector, and we expect to increase returns to shareholders. The enterprise value of our group in 2000 was $50 million, and the value of our group in 2014 was pegged at $5 billion, a fifty-fold increase in our business over a 14-year period. We are executing a plan that we told the world we would do back then, and we have ensured that we have not deviated from our original business plan. The ConocoPhillips transaction is one that sees Oando become the leading indigenous oil and gas producer in the country. Our oil production has increased significantly from 5,000bpd to 54,100bpd. It certainly puts us in the top 100 oil and gas companies globally in terms of reserves and production, and it is a transaction that makes us the first Nigerian company to become one of the partners in an onshore joint venture. The other onshore joint venture partners in Nigeria are Shell, Total, Chevron, and ExxonMobil. This is a significant achievement because we know it has taken millions of dollars in resources to create what we are investing and partnering in today. It also marks the beginning of our transition to become a full-fledged integrated exploration and production company. We have always wanted a substantial portion of our capital base to be invested in upstream activities, and having achieved that, we intend to do more transactions of this nature to expand our footprint within the sector. We expect improved returns due to a higher-value margin from upstream operations, which stands at 25% as opposed to the 1.9% percent margins of downstream activities. As a group, deconsolidation is key for us. We have a listed upstream subsidiary and we will list our downstream and midstream businesses in such a way that we all have three separate Oando on the exchange, allow people to invest in the different areas of operation. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Forte has just received an investment of $200 million by Mercuria Group in exchange for a 17% stake. How has this deal changed Forte's strategy going forward?</h4><p>Our five-year strategic business outlook, which commenced in 2015, makes mention of a number of key focus areas. We said we would strengthen our balance sheet and optimize our working capital mix amongst other things. We also stated that we would aggressively pursue M&amp;A opportunities along the energy value chain. This deal with Mercuria fulfills some of these aspirations. This is not so much of a change in strategic direction, but rather a fulfillment of a major anchor point of our strategic plan. We have had a long-term trading relationship with Mercuria, and this investment now deepens opportunities for us to derive full benefits of backward integration along the value chain.</p><h4>How has the current economic situation affected your business?</h4><p>Our business model is built on the foundations of resilience and our ability to adapt to changes in our operating environment. The significant dip in oil prices and its spiral effects on the Nigerian economy and our business were taken into account for our forecast for the year. Current oil prices have adversely affected the national income and consequently fuels consumption on the retail segment of our business. Our upstream services business has also been negatively impacted as the E&amp;P companies have had to re-negotiated contracts in view of the falling oil prices. However, diversification into the power generation business and our focus on high-margin products, such as lubricants and LPG, have allowed us to absorb these shocks, which I believe are temporary. The new government is doing all it can to create a stable business environment that will improve the overall macro-economic conditions in Nigeria.  </p><h4>Forte acquired the Geregu Power Plant during the power sector privatization and has recently signed an agreement with Siemens to overhaul it. What role do you envision power sector projects playing in Forte Oil's mix of assets in the future?</h4><p>We have always stressed that our goal was to diversify our revenue base, and we achieved this via the strategic acquisition of the Geregu Power Plant. Power sector projects will continue be center stage of our growth aspirations. Going forward, we expect to see the power business contribute significantly to our corporate basket. Our expectation is that as the government continues to provide the right enabling environment, particularly in terms of necessary improvements to the existing regulatory and operational frameworks, our strategic assets will deliver even more value to the shareholders. In addition, as more Nigerians set up SMEs and our local industries step up their production as a result of improved power supply, we foresee a growth in the demand for power required to meet their operational needs. The major overhaul places us in a good stead to meet the ramped up demand.</p><h4>As Nigeria's economy grows and per-capita GDP rises with it, what are the growth prospects in your downstream distribution business? </h4><p>Ours is a youthful population with rising demand for consumable products. Our passion is to keep improving lives by providing uncommon service solutions to all Nigerians. As we expand our retail footprints and continue to provide convenient and affordable services, the response from Nigerians has been positive. Growth opportunities for fuels and lubricants lie in our growing population, and in rising demand for distribution from the manufacturing sector in the near future stemming from increased power supply. We also expect increased demand for cooking gas as Nigerians are now making the switch to the LPG. We are also developing and providing convenient payment solutions such as the FO Advantage card to our growing middle class. We are building partnerships with reputable brands to increase traffic to our stations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did LS Energia choose to establish its headquarters in Panama?</h4><p>Out of all the countries that we could have picked, Panama seemed to be the one with the best environment. It has high-quality infrastructure, the airport is a hub, and there are a number of fiscal benefits. We see Panama in the same way people see Dubai in the Middle East; it is a country that has security, a solid legal framework, and many other factors that allow you to work efficiently. Here you can really focus on work and what you do.</p><a href="http://admin.thebusinessyear.com/Article/Edit/5694cd8586b7b011e86ac380#"></a><h4>Can you tell us about the company's global reach and why you choose these locations?</h4><p>We have plants all over the world. We have a few in Colombia and Mexico, and many in Venezuela; however, lately we have been getting a lot of work from Africa. Our business is strongest in developing markets. We have been doing business there successfully for over 25 years.</p><h4>What are your expansion plans in Africa?</h4><p>We were initially trying to cover Africa as a whole, but after two years we decided to concentrate on just a few countries. For instance, we presently have a large team of expat and local operators and maintenance employees running plants in West Africa. We find that focusing enables us to provide a higher level of service to our customers and produces better results for the company.</p><h4>What impact has LS Energia had on the development of countries in which it is present?</h4><p>We always feel pride working in this sector. When you first provide reliable energy to a city that previously did not have electricity, as we have done in Africa, people are grateful and it feels good. The less developed a country is, the more impact you have. </p><h4>You also do consultancy services; who are your clients?</h4><p>We provide consultancy services to help our customers decide what is best for them, even if it means recommending someone else instead of us. We advise what is best and can help in the transition. We also help them design a better power grid. In many countries in which we work, you find that the public employer is there for political reasons rather than merit, which is when they need help the most because they do not have the technical skills and capabilities.</p><h4>How do you assess Panama's efforts in moving toward renewables?</h4><p>Where we have dedicated the most time and effort is natural gas and liquid fuels; however, we are making a major effort regarding solar, much more than wind or hydro, as we see a lot of potential here. One of the challenges, especially in Africa or even Latin America, is to bring power to remote villages. If you string in cables from the power grid it will cost too much money and it is not going to be effective. If you put a power plant there then you have to supply the fuel, which is even worse. Solar, on the other hand, if available, is free; you just build the panels and power the town. That is where we see the best solution and best replacement for fossil fuels, which, of course, helps the environment.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges in the implementation of power from renewable energy?</h4><p>Once you have a cell phone, you cannot live without it, and that same rule applies to electricity once delivered to a town—it has to be delivered consistently and with quality. This is a huge challenge, especially when we are talking about a remote area. There are technologies for energy storage, which brings some level of solution.</p><h4>Where are your R&amp;D efforts focused and what innovations are you working on?</h4><p>We are planning our next moves on the renewable side, which is to build hybrid plants. There are towns that require power for more than, for example, 5,000 people, where it is not feasible to have batteries that last that long. Therefore, we are working on hybrid plants where you have a conventional power source, such as a generator, but you only run the generator when your primary source of electricity, be it solar or wind, is not there and your batteries are empty. This allows for more reliable power, and is a concept we are working on now.</p><h4>What are your plans for expansion in Panama?</h4><p>From here in Panama, we are looking at South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, which are three separate areas for us. South America is pretty well developed as far as power generation goes. But this is not the case for the Caribbean, which mostly works with unclean fuels, such as diesel. First, this source of power is expensive and second, the pollution caused acts as a deterrent to the tourism industry on which these islands depend. Those countries present considerable challenges but are also exciting places to work. We are trying to develop that market from our base in Panama. There is a similar situation in Central America, the difference being that Central America has hydro, which is a good source of power, but the region also relies on imported fossil fuels when the reservoirs are low or empty. Again, the hybrid concept may be the ultimate answer, combining technologies.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>I predict that the price of oil in 2016 will continue to be low, which has an impact on our business and not necessarily in a positive way. You may think that a lower cost of energy implies more work for us, but it actually means that countries with fewer investment capabilities do not invest in the technology, as they expect their returns will be lower. This year is not going to be a bad one altogether; we will see a year of cheaper energy and countries that depend on imports of energy will experience growth, whereas those living out of energy exports are going to be going down. You will see Europe and Asia grow, and other countries slow down a little. For sure, it is going to be an interesting year.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the evolution of the mining sector in Peru over the last few years, and how has it impacted your operations?</h4><p>As commodity prices have fallen, smaller mines have had to shut down or limit their production. There have also been fewer large-scale investments in the sector. Copper prices were the last to slow down. The smaller mines have generally opted to cut costs by choosing cheaper products, which are also the less reliable, while the larger mining houses like Southern, Freeport, Barrick, Glencore, BHP, and Newmont all stay with traditional suppliers like us, because they do bulk mining and are large operations; the cost for them to stop is tremendous so they stay close to the OEMs. The landscape has changed. When Atlas Copco Peruana started, we were selling pneumatic handheld equipment and some basic compressors. Now we are partners with our clients, and we do not just sell them equipment; we sell them services and solutions.</p><h4>How has the competition in this market evolved over the years?</h4><p>In surface mining we compete with Caterpillar, and in underground mining we compete with Caterpillar and Sandvik. Over the last 15 to 20 years, there has also been an increase in Korean and Chinese companies entering the market, and these companies have been able to replicate existing technologies at a much lower cost but not at the same quality. Besides that, there are also some local producers whom we compete with in Peru, since Peru is a very mature mining market.</p><h4>What role does innovation and technology transfer play in Atlas Copco's operations in Peru?</h4><p>We have always looked at how we can use technology to make mining more efficient. We work to introduce new technologies and showcase what technology and innovation can mean to our client's operations. This is more than just about providing equipment. We have to work together with our partners to figure out how best to integrate technologies, and help them make adjustments in their operations to be able to incorporate these innovations and new technologies when and where the need arises. We are helping shape a framework in which the technologies can be implemented and applied into their operations. Looking at Peru overall, the country utilizes traditional mining methods, and technological advances were slow to catch on during the last mining boom. The majority of advances have been mostly in surface mining, where the multinationals are the most active as they have operations of scale. This is also where a lot of the technology transfer happens. We can now talk to our customers about automated drilling and having repeatability in their processes, because typically in countries where labor costs are nominal, companies tend to not pay too much attention to automation. But we can show that it is not just a matter of the cost of implementing and operating it, and also training the people to use it, it is a matter of achieving consistency and repeatability in your own production.</p><h4>Is human capital a challenge in Peru in general, and for Atlas Copco's operations here?</h4><p>In 2016, we will be investing heavily in new training programs for our technicians because there is a constant turnover and our people are in high demand since we have a very good training package as it is. We also have a retention plan that we have been working on for a couple of years. We have raised wage plans, although we realize that other soft benefits are needed as well, such as better living conditions, better schedules, easier ways to work your way up in the organization, things to make the job more appealing, and to show that there are more opportunities to grow. We also send people to other countries in Latin America to help train them.</p><h4>How does Atlas Copco find a synergy between economic growth and environmental stewardship?</h4><p>In terms of sustainability, we do remanufacturing, where we take components from old products and overhaul them to a like-new state equivalent to new components. We can both save on scrapping and also sell our products at a lower cost to our customers. That also means we produce less waste, there are fewer wasted resources, and fewer emissions.</p><h4>What are your targets and expectations for 2016?</h4><p>In 2016 we do not expect any uptakes in investment capital. In the medium term, we expect growth. As commodities have been depressed and supplies have gone down, the demand will eventually outstrip it, so it is just a matter of when it will happen. Over 10 years we expect 7-10% growth. To this end, we are making the necessary investment, investing in training, in our consumable business, and in service support. Consumables and service support will be the two bookends for us in 2016. We will continue to focus on technology, bringing in machines that are brand new to this market. Before they are sold, they will be trialed with some of our big customers because this is the best way to show that we're the market leader. We have the financial wherewithal to do that as a large multinational corporation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The NSE recently upgraded its equity-trading platform with NASDAQ technology. How has that affected operations at the exchange?</h4><p>To enhance the investor experience, the NSE launched its X-Gen trading platform in September 2013. X-Gen is based on a number of leading technologies, including the NASDAQ OMX's X-Stream matching engine. It also supports other 21st century technology previously implemented by the exchange, such as a new website equipped with a real-time feed to a ticker and an upgraded virtual private network 20 times faster than the previous offering. Since its launch, X-Gen has demonstrated its innovative trading capabilities and the Nigerian capital market has benefited immensely. We have achieved improved market order flow, increases in the number of trades, high availability, direct market access, remote trading, and income diversification. X-Gen has brought about the advent of mobile and online trading technologies to the Nigerian Capital Market, a feat that could revolutionize market dynamics. Riding on the new platform, most of our dealing member firms have tapped into the benefits to introduce online trading platforms to deepen their businesses.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recently announced plan to overhaul the NSE to make it easier for foreign investors to access the market?</h4><p>To achieve our ambitions for market growth and development, the NSE is working on defining industry initiatives that will positively impact the Nigerian capital market, one of which is the revamp of the current market structure. Recently, we launched the Premium Board for companies that adhere to international best practices for corporate governance and meet the Exchange's highest standards of capitalization and liquidity. In a few months, we also plan to institute a Growth Board that aims to support high growth potential companies. In 2014, we signed a contractual agreement with the London Stock Exchange (LSE) to encourage dual listings and promoting each other's markets in a manner that ensures that investors and issuers are fully aware of the investing/listing benefits in both markets. In June 2015, the NSE and LSE held a Dual Listing Conference in London. We also just recently returned from a technical tour of the LSE Group with the purpose of furthering discussions on increasing the depth of the Nigerian capital market. </p><h4>What progress has been made in recent years to strengthen corporate governance and transparency among Nigerian firms to attract investment?</h4><p>Diverse investment products, strong regulation, increased transparency, and easy access to the market have ensured increased participation by domestic investors. To be listed is to be in the public spotlight, which connotes transparency, accountability, and integrity—all of which are key elements of corporate governance, integral in attracting both foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and foreign direct investment (FDI). In 2014, we launched the Corporate Governance Rating System (CGRS), which provides assurance for investors by evaluating companies based on the quality of their corporate integrity, corporate compliance with governance rules, and understanding of fiduciary responsibilities by directors and corporate reputation. Currently, CGRS is a key requirement for companies to be admitted into the NSE Premium Board. To facilitate information disclosure, transparency, and accountability in the marketplace, the Exchange also introduced a secure platform, X-Issuer, which allows issuers to electronically submit financial and other relevant information to the market and the Exchange in a seamless fashion. The information provided through the X-Issuer provides a wealth of information that guides investors and intermediaries in investment decisions simultaneously. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Amcon was founded five years ago in order to save the financial system after the 2008 crisis. What about the structure of Amcon makes it different from the way that other countries approached the financial crisis?</h4><p>Amcon was set up to stabilize, rather than bail out the financial system. There are four major stakeholders in each bank, namely the shareholders, the management, the staff, and the depositors. Those bailed out were the depositors and the staff. The depositors got all of their money back and most of the staff were retained. Management was completely wiped out, so they were not bailed out, and all of the existing management was removed. The shareholders lost, in many cases, over 90% of their investment, and so they were not bailed out. They were left with a nominal amount. By buying both non-performing loans and re-capitalizing, the bulk of the money was spent on recapitalizing these banks. The non-performing loans probably represented some 30 to 40% of Amcon expenditure, and we are fairly certain that, by the time we were done, we would have recovered close to 100% of the money that we invested in that area. The money we invested in recapitalization is gone, and that is the reason for the sinking fund that the banks are contributing to.</p><h4>You have been successful in selling off some of the assets that you acquired. You closed a landmark sale earlier this year of Mainstreet Bank to Skye Bank, and before that Enterprise Bank to Heritage Bank. What do those sales indicate to you about the program and also about the sales that are still to happen with Wema Bank, Unity, and Keystone?</h4><p>There were three banks that were bridged in 2011, although it was never part of the plan to bridge those banks when AMCON came into existence. Even though we had a mandate to recapitalize institutions, we never expected recapitalizing to 100%. Those three banks came about because they could not find any buyers at the time, and we knew that we had to divest as soon as was practical, then stabilize and recapitalize the bank; doing so made it divestible. We thought that we would recover 20% of our investment in those banks, but we ended up recovering close to 30%, so we did better than we expected.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Nigeria needs economic debate. One of the most damaging fallacies is that a weak naira is bad for Nigeria. In fact, a weak Naira is good for Nigeria as a country. It may be temporarily bad for the elite, who consume the bulk of foreign goods, but in the long run it is good for Nigeria because it will create employment and encourage manufacturing if it is implemented in conjunction with other policies. It will stop people from buying Range Rovers, and it will encourage people to start manufacturing. Nigeria must clarify what exchange rate is optimal, in conjunction with interest rates. Interest rates now are at about 27% plus three points, which is about 30%. This is not sustainable, as nobody can manufacture or run a small business under these circumstances. Also, we are subsidizing foreign exchange and we want to see low interest rates for specific industries. It is almost like we are moving toward a central economy, which does not work. The cost of this dynamic is inflation, but it is better to have jobs and face 20% inflation than high unemployment at 5% inflation. It is important to establish tolerable inflation levels. The third matter that we need to address as a country is tolerable debt levels. We have debt to GDP of 11%, which is well below countries like the US. We have government guarantees  to GDP of 1%, while the US is at 90%. Debt service to GDP in Nigeria is at 0.8%, while in the UK it is 2.3% and interest rates are at almost zero. We must have GDP growth of 12% per year at a minimum for the next 10 years, otherwise we are going nowhere. These are the discussions we must have, and until we have them and establish a clear national economic direction, the situation will only get worse economically, because oil prices are not going anywhere anytime soon. </p>]]></richbody0content>

Could you unpack those results?</h4><p>Skye Bank had always taken the route of organic growth strategy until 2013 when we decided to acquire one of the nationalized banks offered for sale by the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON). Consequently, in line with regulatory requirements, the Bank submitted an Expression of Interest (EoI) for the acquisition of Enterprise Bank Limited, for which Heritage Bank Limited was announced the preferred bidder on September 11, 2014. Skye Bank later emerged as the preferred bidder for Mainstreet Bank Limited (MBL) on October 3, 2014 after a rigorous bidding process. The Bank effectively took over the management of MBL on December 18, 2014. The acquisition of MBL has repositioned and transformed Skye Bank to a more commercially inclined institution. Following the takeover of MBL, both institutions were fully integrated in June 2015 and are now running on one of best and most efficient banking applications in Nigeria; Flexcube 12.0. The speedy and smooth integration was a result of past investments in best-of-class IT infrastructure made by the Bank in the last two years. With the acquisition, the Bank's branch network grew from 259 to 469 branches in Nigeria, and about 70 branches have been slated for closure as part of the Bank's ongoing branch rationalization exercise. This network made Skye Bank the 4th largest bank by branch network. The Bank is already reaping the benefits of this acquisition. For instance, owing to the boost in business activities, we recorded 81% growth in pre-tax profit in 1Q2015. In absolute terms, we posted a pre-tax profit of NGN6.2 billion and NGN10.7 billion period 1Q2015 and 2Q2015, respectively.</p><h4>What were some of the benefits of the Mainstreet Bank takeover, and how did this provide you with opportunities like agricultural lending?</h4><p>In terms of service quality and turnaround time, MBL had not been a great brand prior to our acquisition. However, MBL has a pool of loyal institutional and corporate customers who remained with the bank despite its status as an AMCON-owned bank. This loyalty is also reflected in its customer base, which did not reduce significantly prior to AMCON take-over. MBL also has a competitive advantage in agriculture lending, which accounted for 12.6% and 16.9% of its total loans in 2012 and 2013 respectively. NPL ratio on agriculture loans was very negligible, at 0.01%. We expect to leverage MBL's success story and footprint in agriculture business and ensure our complete coverage and presence in all the 36 states of Nigeria. </p><h4>Do you have plans to reach beyond Gambia and Sierra Leone? And will future growth come from brick-and-mortar expansion or other means?</h4><p>As one of the market leaders in e-business in Nigeria, we provide top-notch and tailored e-solutions for our corporate and public sector clients. For instance, the Bank's internet banking platform has robust functionalities that meet the needs of our corporate and growing middle-income class customer. Similarly, in our quest to provide secured e-channel platforms for our esteemed customers locally and internationally, we recently received three International Certifications from the UK Trade and Investment. The three awards include ISO 20000 IT Service Management, ISO 27001 Information Security Management, and ISO 22301 Business Continuity Management. We have invested in the creation of ATM galleries and e-centers as opposed to brick-and-mortar branches. We also have a business office in Dublin that acts as an investment company. We plan to use it as an access point for clients looking for projects in Nigeria. </p><h4>How has Skye Bank responded to the Forex restrictions that were recently put in place? </h4><p>Skye Bank ensures strict compliance with regulatory directives. However, we expect certain developments to occur as a consequence of the foreign exchange restriction. There are major issues for correspondent banks, but the full impact on the banking industry is still not clear. In Skye Bank, some of our transactions will be affected, as we need to clear the backlog in a bid to maintain the Bank's credibility and reputation. On the other hand, institutions with huge investments in certain lines of trade like rice importation may have issues with meeting their banking obligations. This may lead to higher credit impairment and lower earnings from such transactions. Although the policy has its own advantages, we will continue to evaluate the impact of the policy on our overall business. This puts us in a position to consider alternative forms of generating income. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Diamond Bank is among the region's newest and most ambitious players and has a unique take on the Nigerian banking arena. Can you explain how it fits into the larger banking sector?</h4><p>Diamond Bank started by building a platform that would enable people to transfer from one place to another in real time. The middle market, which is mostly trade across Nigeria, was physically carrying cash from one place to another to exchange. This helped drive our business and acquire new customers in a short space of time.</p><h4>Last year, Caryle Group took a stake in Diamond, its first in any Nigerian business and one of the largest private equity transactions in Africa last year. What is the significance of that level of investment from an internationally recognized private equity firm in the Nigerian banking space?</h4><p>There is strength in the Carlyle brand, which gives us global respect. Carlyle is one of the biggest private equity firms that has invested in Africa, after doing their due diligence, and so that speaks volumes. That allows us to leverage their global reach. They made an equity investment, and their goals are to continue to optimize our technology and to increase our footprint. In terms of branches, we have covered most of Nigeria, but we will invest in modernization, ATMs, and connectivity. Once the majority of our customers no longer feel that they need to come to the bank to perform transactions, they are going to be used for advisory services. It is particularly through SME customers that we are trying grow; access to advisory services and markets will ensure that they are sustainable and help them build that capacity from a governance perspective.</p><h4>What strategic decisions have contributed to your first-half financial results?</h4><p>Quite a few regulatory policies came into play, and there were three in the first half of the year. The cash ratio played a large role in the harmonization of private and public sector funds, which hurt us due to our portfolio. And then of course, the new foreign exchange laws have not helped. We command quite a lot in terms of the trade and business that goes on, and there has been a vast drop in trade as a result of the availability of funds, especially in light of the economic situation and the drop in oil prices. We have a diverse customer base and customer business and do not have extensive public sector involvement. Meanwhile, we have also observed that our mobile business channel will help us withstand any shocks to the system.</p><h4>You have invested in mobile technology and are recognized as a bank in West Africa with a unique approach to that concept. What is the way forward?</h4><p>We cater to mainstream customers numbering 4.5 million, half a million of which have signed up for mobile banking. We intend to reach the million mark by the end of this year, and double that by the end of 2016. The cost of the internet is declining, as is that of smartphones, and we are even lending to facilitate acquisition. An interesting example of our strategy is Better Proposition, a product mainly aimed at women. When travelling around Lagos, or indeed elsewhere in Nigeria, one comes across markets where women hold the authoritative role. We find in many cases that while they may be close to brick-and-mortar branches, they never enter a bank. In fact, they lack a bank account, relying instead on an informal system fraught with high interest rates and uncertainty. What we did was displace this with inclusion in the formal financial system by taking the bank to them. We built a proposition whereby we hired and trained sales agents, and built a cloud-based banking application to be linked to our main server, and then signed up customers with Interswitch to then be followed up with a SIM card-based bank card. We launched it 24 months ago and today have 200,000 customers, according to 100 branch locations, with over NGN3 billion in total balances and an engagement rate of 97%, where the average balance is comparable to mainstream savings account holders; all of this was done through mobile banking. What we are trying to do with our banking and application perspective is to go beyond banking, particularly with our mobile app. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Ecobank is the continent's largest bank, present in 36 African countries, but Nigeria has recently been the center of the bank's attention. What importance does the Nigerian market have among the bank's operations?</h4><p>Nigeria was the second subsidiary of Ecobank Transnational Inc. (ETI), after Togo, but started business years after Togo. It started as a small niche bank with a strong focus on corporate and investment banking, as well as wealth management. When the Nigerian banks started growing as a result of the commodity boom, it remained a niche player. The founders of ETI always considered Nigeria as an important country and, therefore, it was the second country where they launched their operations. The majority of the founding fathers were from Nigeria. Over the years, as banks in Nigeria grew we did not grow in tandem. Our operations in the region grew rapidly, but we did not improve our market share in Nigeria. The target was thereafter set to make the bank one of the top three players in the Nigerian landscape. Nigeria was a dominant economy and was playing an important economic and political role in stabilizing the region, and we were starting to see linkages in trade among all the other African countries. At some point, a large presence in Nigeria will finance and better integrate the economies of some of the smaller countries, leveraging the businesses coming from Nigeria. </p><h4>What results do you expect for the second half of 2015?</h4><p>Our growth last year was mainly from loan growth. We were able to finance good transactions in oil and gas, manufacturing, and other sectors. In 2015, there has been significant slowdown in loan growth as the Central Bank tightened its policies as a result of the oil price. People started to panic, as historically, when we have such a massive drop in oil prices it has created portfolio quality problems in Nigeria. But some of those weaknesses have been corrected by imposing limits across different sectors. In the past the finance sector was over-concentrated on energy, and when that sector took a hit, the absorption capacity to deal with it was limited. Over the years, the Central Bank has managed that risk by diversifying the portfolio to avoid any concentration effect when there is a shock in any particular sector. There is no particular sector that has more than 20% of the loan book.</p><h4>How have you been leveraging new tools in the banking industry to move your business forward?</h4><p>The nation's strong focus on cashless policy has changed the banking habits of customers, particularly so-called millennials, who do not go into banks at all. They do their banking through alternative channels, the internet, POS, or ATMs. For any bank to be able to grow there must be a developed and functioning channel. We have to have a good internet banking system and mobile money payments. Today, the only reason we see people coming into the branches is to deposit money. For Ecobank, that has helped us to manage the large customer bank that we have—we have over seven million customers. Some of these customers are micro-finance customers and so we need to have a low-cost approach to deal with them, hence the various channels. The next segment that we are looking at is the agent banking system, which the Central Bank has also licensed. We are just waiting for a better rollout program so that we can license agents, whereby people can make cash pull and cash deposits of small values with agents. The telecoms sector, in contrast, has a much broader customer base than we do and we believe that, with mobile money, we should be able to reach out to most of their customers. That problem will be resolved subsequently and that segment will take off at some point in time. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What strategies underpinned your 17% YoY increase in profits?</h4><p>It all boils down to innovation. At Zenith, we try to look at how to do things better, and differently. The bottom-line is understanding how to connect with our customers and add value to their business. We have seen that, over time, once a customer believes that there is value derived from our business they will come to us. Our improvements in profitability QoQ between the previous and the current year boil down to what we have been able to do with our customers. Besides this, we have also gained market share because of the quality of our service</p><h4>Zenith opened a branch in Dubai and hopes to consolidate its place in international markets. How do these actions complement each other?</h4><p>In West African countries and in the UK, we have done extremely well. We wanted to be very compact, because at the end of the day we need to have checks to ensure that service is up to speed and that there is uniformity in delivery. Our branch in Dubai is intended to serve the growing market in Asian countries, and Dubai is in a strategic location. We can serve most of our customers in Asia from there</p><h4>How have the pressure on the currency and the Forex restrictions affected your business?</h4><p>The challenge that we face is not the fault of any specific actor. Commodities like petrol and crude oil are not completely different from other commodities, such as cocoa, cotton, and rubber. The prices naturally fluctuate and at some point they will peak and then fall. The way that markets react is what really matters. Naturally, it is bound to affect us, and the price of crude oil has dropped from over $100 per barrel, to on average $55, a decline of about 50%. However, the way we have reacted as a country has been quite positive. We have taken some proactive steps and the economy is undergoing the necessary transition. The government and the Central Bank are encouraging the economic players here to look inwards and see how we can either apply import substitution, or expand their base and develop the local industry. I am not opposed to the Forex restrictions. We have over 10 rice mills in the country today, and some of these millers say that they were given incentives to set them up. The CBN has taken a step in the right direction, and they have the backing of the entire banking industry. If we look inwards, we can actually conserve a lot of foreign exchange, and we can employ more people who are going to go back into agriculture. We cannot continue to import endlessly. It is really important to make the distinction. We are challenged for now as an economy, but the way we are responding is quite positive, and over time we expect to see positive growth.</p><h4>Zenith is often considered Nigeria's international bank. How did you achieve that?</h4><p>Our success is largely a product of our client-base. We have the largest number of multinationals as customers, and that is a major endorsement for the brand and for the bank. If most of the multinationals, across all sectors, chose Zenith Bank over international banks here, it sends a strong message. Apart from the US, we have covered almost all the key financial markets of the world.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Growth will definitely be subdued because of the challenges in the economy, but in the long term the potential is massive and will present investment opportunities. From a banking perspective, we mirror the economy. When the economy is under pressure, it resonates in the financial system. We are committed to looking at innovative ways to gain even more market share. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What ambitions do you have in Nigeria's electricity market?</h4><p>Before our acquisition of Transcorp National Corporation (TNC), Transcorp had a number of under-performing assets and had never paid a dividend to its 300,000 shareholders. TNC is now profitable, paid dividends in 2014, and is a major player in the evolving power sector of Nigeria, as the owner of the largest thermal plant in the country, the Ughelli Power Plant, which has a nameplate capacity of 1,000MW. One of the major challenges for both large and small businesses in Nigeria is ensuring access to a steady and affordable power supply. The irregularity of power and the cost of off-grid power means that many good businesses have floundered because operating costs are excessively high. We have an audacious but achievable aim to generate and provide at least 25% of Nigeria's power consumption needs in the next five years, and the wholly owned Transcorp Power Limited will play a significant role in realizing this ambition. I am also a champion of President Obama's Power Africa Initiative, which advocates for steady power as an integral right of all Africans. We have high expectations of the power sector in Nigeria and we are confident that we will democratize access to power for all Africans. </p><h4>The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has tightened monetary policy this year and restricted access to foreign exchange. How will the new regulations impact your business in 2016?</h4><p>The CBN has made the decision to restrict foreign exchange and tighten monetary policy in response to the falling price of oil, which has also resulted in a devaluation of the naira. As long as Nigeria and other countries in Africa continue to rely heavily on oil or other primary commodities as their principal source of foreign exchange, African economies will remain vulnerable to the vagaries of world commodity prices. This has to change. At Heirs Holdings, we are committed to focusing on a wide array of industry sectors, and one of those is oil and gas. I doubt that the CBN's activities will adversely affect our activities. Our power business does require a lot of foreign exchange for plant development and maintenance, but we will fare well because our business model in other areas is sufficiently diversified, and a number of the ventures we are involved in focus on adding value to products and services produced in Africa as well as identifying markets for them both within Africa and beyond. Nigeria, and indeed all similar countries across Africa, need to move away from being so commodity-dependent. We need to create robust and diverse economies, focus on our competitive advantages, and be aggressive in the positioning of our offerings. </p><h4>From an economic perspective, what is important about the recent elections and what policy direction do you hope to see emerge?</h4><p>From an economic perspective, I am very happy that the recent elections and transition in Nigeria were without incident. This is evidence of a growing political maturity. Business thrives in a secure and stable environment, so peaceful elections and transitions are good for business. Governments and policymakers also need to focus more energy and attention on a consistent policy regime aimed at ensuring that the right sort of incentives are created to make African economies more productive. We need home markets that are strong, stable, and pro-growth, as this creates a strong basis for foreign expansion. As an Africapitalist, I believe government and the private sector must work in a collaborative and sustained manner to solve problems, create wealth, and provide decent livelihoods to all of Africa's people. That is a worthy legacy and a narrative to define Africa's future. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Zenith Bank is now among the top banks in the world. How has your philosophy as its founder driven the institution's investments?</h4><p>Zenith Bank is simply built on the core values of people, technology, and service. A super synergy between these values has been the backbone of Zenith Bank from inception to date. Zenith thrives by attracting excellent people and putting the right people in the right places. Zenith Bank staff receives the best training available, which has helped to build a strong corporate culture of goal-oriented activities. By the continuous training of our staff and exposing them to best practices in all aspects of banking, our people are empowered to be creative, innovative, and, at the same time, operate at the highest level of efficiency. All these have contributed to a stable and highly motivated workforce in Zenith. As a result of the training and exposure we give to our staff, we have been able to innovate, create, and lead a banking revolution in Nigeria, leveraging cutting-edge technology. Our practice at Zenith is to continually seek ways of improving existing banking practices while constantly challenging benchmarks. The combination of highly motivated staff and state-of-the-art technology produces excellent customer service, which has been our point of distinction within the Nigerian banking landscape. Our ability to meet and exceed the expectations of our customers over the years has made our bank attractive to major businesses at home and abroad. As a result of being satisfied with our services, our customers have rewarded us by being our ambassadors as they continue to market us and give us references. This has challenged us to continuously seek ways of making our customers happier. This partly explains why Zenith's market share of the Nigerian banking business is on the increase. </p><h4>Zenith has been a standout bank since it was founded. How has democracy enabled enterprise in Nigeria?</h4><p>As a bank that believes in putting the right people in the right places, Zenith has, since  its inception, attracted and retained seasoned professionals in all areas of our organization. This has helped Zenith to build a reputation as a compliance-conscious bank, which has made it easier for us to work with governments at all tiers and the several regulatory agencies in Nigeria and other countries. Naturally, democracy has helped us to grow as a bank by enhancing confidence and encouraging entrepreneurship. As a Nigerian bank with an international footprint, we have supported and will continue to support the programs and policies of government in jurisdictions where we operate. As a reward for our conscious efforts on compliance with laws and regulations, and support of government programs, we have received significant support from government in Nigeria and outside and we will continue to work cordially for more support. The consolidation exercise that resulted in having big Nigerian banks has enabled Nigerian banks to compete comfortably with other banks in the world. As players in the banking industry, we expect the new administration to continue to support the growth of Nigeria n banks, as this helps the banks create jobs, wealth, and expand into other countries.</p><h4>The CBN has tightened monetary policy in 2015 by imposing FX restrictions on certain imports, a move that some analysts predict will cause inflation in the long term. How have monetary conditions affected Zenith's business, and what, in your opinion, is needed to stabilize the market?</h4><p>This is a brilliant idea. Oil prices have plummeted by almost 50% since September 2014 and have recently dropped to below $45 per barrel. The Nigerian economy is overtly import-dependent and this has led to a significant loss in foreign exchange. Therefore, the imposition of FX restrictions on certain imports would not only help in foreign exchange management by saving the country FX hemorrhage, but would also help in promoting local industries with its attendant spillover effect on employment generation as well as wealth creation. The current monetary condition is a fallout of dwindling oil prices and drop in government receipts. The implication is that the CBN is not able to meet all the FX needs of every customer. However, Zenith is coping very well with the current situation by FX rationing to meet the needs of our customers while ensuring compliance with relevant laws and regulations.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>The outlook for the remaining part of the year is bright, given the public confidence in the current government, since government policies affect businesses to a reasonable extent. Nigeria, being the biggest economy in Africa, is the preferred investment destination for everyone looking to maximize their return on investment. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Regulated Growth]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[regulated-growth]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What key policy moves have ensured the health and growth of Nigerian banks up to this point?</h4><p>A number of policy measures have helped sustain the health and growth of Nigerian banks and enabled the industry to continue attracting the interest of foreign banks. Most importantly, we have strengthened the Risk-Based Supervision (RBS) framework, built specialist supervisory capacity to reflect the structure and sector concentration of banking system credits, and developed a stronger and more robust macroprudential regulation and supervision framework. We have also worked with relevant stakeholders to establish commercial courts in Nigeria so as to expedite the adjudication of banking related disputes and stem the growth of purchasing non-performing loans (NPLs). The abolition of the practice of uniform banking and return to mono-line banking in which banks are categorized into commercial, merchant, and specialized banks has curtailed the scope of individual banks' permissible activities and minimized contagion risk. The establishment of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) in 2010 led to the recapitalization of ten troubled banks, including three bridge banks, the injection of additional liquidity into the banking system through the NPLs of the banks, and the facilitation of the mergers and acquisitions of seven of the ten banks. Two of the banks, in which the CBN did not intervene, have also been restructured and returned to good health by their owners, while one bridge bank is slated for sale before the end of 2015. </p><h4>The CBN recently issued a list of Forex restricted imports intended to bolster foreign reserves, defend against inflation, and encourage the development of local capacity in agriculture and manufacturing. Are these policies viable in the long term?</h4><p>In the five-year agenda of the CBN, I underlined the importance of non-conventional approaches to achieving our mandate and the need to assume a wider responsibility in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the economy. The external headwinds which the economy has been exposed to over the past year, with a close to 50% drop in crude oil prices and the impact this has had on our external reserves, has only made it imperative that we refocus our energy on encouraging productivity in key sectors of the economy, relative to supporting consumption activities, which have little or no impact on the creation of jobs in the local economy. In a developing country like Nigeria, it is critical for the central bank to assume responsibilities that foster economic growth and job creation. Hence, the discontinuance of foreign exchange allocations for the importation of certain commodities was designed to both preserve our external reserves and simultaneously boost domestic supply capacity and job creation. Presently, we have substantially idle domestic capacity. For instance, millions of tons of locally produced paddy rice are left unprocessed by our underutilized rice mills while tons of almost expired rice find their way into the country. This undermines domestic productivity, exports jobs, and heightens poverty. As I noted in other discourses, development does not occur in a vacuum, but has to be triggered by a calculated policy mix. The present stage of Nigeria's development, which is still predominantly agriculturally based, with very little industrial development, needs to be nurtured and scaled up to achieve the country's aspiration of being one of the twenty largest economies by 2020, articulated in its Vision 2020 agenda. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>One of the prevailing challenges of the Nigerian economy is the pressure on our external reserves occasioned by the huge fall in crude oil prices and aggravated by speculative FX demand, round tripping and front loading activities in the FX market. Another challenge confronting Nigeria is the less than balanced domestic aggregate supply, which has inadvertently undermined job creation and amplified poverty. The resolute determination and strategic planning of the current government coupled with the various interventions and initiatives of the CBN will contain any adverse consequences of these challenges. Our prognosis is that even in the face of continued softened oil prices, the clouds will lift in the course of the year. We hope to see improvements in our domestic refining capacity, which will help to reduce demand for FX for petroleum imports and therefore reduce pressure on our reserves. These critical factors will help to mitigate the impact of the external shocks that the economy is experiencing. Overall, my outlook for the Nigerian economy is positive. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As an important player in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) in Abuja, what is AICL's mission in the FCT?</h4><p>AICL is a holding company fully owned by the Federal Capital Territory Administration. Our role as a catalyst for economic development provides an atmosphere where entrepreneurship thrives and facilitates investments to enhance the socioeconomic life of citizens of the city, and Nigerians in general. As a holding company, we supervise a number of companies, while also being owners of those companies. Our operations are diverse and focused mainly on property development, markets development and management, transportation, equity and portfolio management, and consultancy and general services. In the property sector, we are engaged in the construction of medium to high income residential real estate areas within the city, and our subsidiary APDC (Abuja Property Development Company) has keyed into the vision by providing low income housing on the outskirts of the city. We also develop commercial real estate such as shopping plazas, neighborhood centers, and office suites, and are currently building one of the largest shopping malls (AICL Mall, Guzape) in the new Guzape District within the city. AICL Market development activities include the building of four BOT markets through PPP arrangements and the ownership and facility management of Wuse, Garki and other markets through our subsidiary company, AMML (Abuja Markets Management Limited). AICL is actively engaged in the transportation sector within the FCT. We provide the number one city taxi line (Abuja Taxis), while the mass transit buses are operated by our subsidiary, AUMTCO (Abuja Urban Mass Transit Company) in line with the FCTA transportation master plan. In addition, AICL has substantial equity in big ticket projects and assets such as Abuja Automotive Village, Abuja Film Village, International Conference Center, Eagle Square, Abuja Technology Village Free Zone, Aso Savings &amp; Loans, World Trade Centre &amp; Towers, and Abuja City Center Development Projects, giving the company a robust and diverse portfolio. Finally, we offer consultancy services to other state governments by helping them set up an investment unit such as ours and have been able to startup companies in the ICT and waste management sectors of the economy.</p><h4>What services do you provide for foreign investors wanting to do business in Abuja?</h4><p>It is within our mandate to enter into joint ventures to facilitate investments in the Federal Capital Territory. Our position as government partners enables us to provide a platform for foreign investors to successfully establish businesses in Abuja. Generally in Nigeria, the investment climate is improving, especially with the new government which emphasizes due process, transparency, and accountability. Even though AICL is fully owned by the government as a limited liability company, we have acquired a legal personality separate from the government. This separation from the government provides us a different operation model which enables us to engage in projects and conclude in a reasonable time with fewer bottlenecks and bureaucracy. The Abuja World Trade Center &amp; Towers, Abuja Downtown Development Project, and Powernoth—AICL Equipment Company Ltd, an integrated waste management services company. These are good examples of ongoing AICL and foreign investment initiatives in the Federal Capital Territory. AICL has a government agency facilitating investments in Abuja is well positioned to offer advisory services to potential investors in areas of regulatory requirements, tax requirements and finance options. We can also provide land equity for potential investors in Abuja.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>We have a positive outlook. First of all, the government has a business philosophy that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and due process. These three things are imperative to the success of any business and are also critical to the success of any government. This will give international investors the confidence to come to Nigeria, because they will know that when they come here to do business, there will not be any cutting of corners, and it will be solely based on transparency and due process, in line with international best practices. In this new political era, there is even more scope for foreign investors to be successful in the country, and we are here to aid them in Abuja. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[collective-reasoning]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mandate of FIRS?</h4><p>The country needs revenue both at the federal and state levels, especially with the program that the federal government has in place. Each of our three tiers of government has the legal prerogative and backing to collect revenue to fund their tier. The federal government has key mandate issues to deliver that require huge amounts of money, and revenue that accrues to the federal account is shared among the states and local governments. To ensure that the states and local government can function properly, the federal government has to be in a position, through FIRS, to provide the required revenue, and this is where we come in. We are working together with State Boards of Internal Revenue (SBIR), as all of SBIR are members of the Joint Tax Board. We have exchanged information with 30 states so far, and have been able to establish close to 110,000 corporate organizations within these 30 states that were not on the database of FIRS. Now that we have identified these gaps, we should see an increase in revenue within 1H2016. VAT has not been adequately tapped; there are many organizations that have been collecting VAT without remitting to FIRS or to the federal government, and we are working together with the State Inland Revenue Services on this. Our target is to increase VAT collections in 2016 by around NGN1 trillion. </p><h4>How is FIRS investing in technology to improve payment collection systems?</h4><p>FIRS has a lot of technology behind it, and the only way we can actually increase revenue is by leveraging this technology. We have ongoing process to link up with federal government ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) so that at the point of payments, the taxes due to the federal or state government will be deducted immediately. When MDAs want to make payments to contractors, the VAT and tax elements could be deducted at the same time they are making electronic payments to their vendors. We are also in discussion with private sector organizations in power and telecom, while the aviation sectors have already taken off, with some companies signing up and agreeing that there will be direct VAT deduction when they sell airline tickets. The strategy is to approach these changes sector by sector, and we have a target within the next six months to link to the major organizations so that when they make payments, and WHT is deducted and remitted immediately without having to wait till the end of the month to make manual returns.</p><h4>What is your outlook on Nigeria's current tax code? Is it in need of revision or it is adequate in its current state?</h4><p>We have to work together with the Joint Tax Board to expose and remove any illegal charges that the general public believe are taxes. The existing laws are clearly defined, so the challenge is in adhering to the laws, and making amendments where necessary. Online trading and electronic purchases across borders is an aspect with which even developed countries have issues with when it comes to taxes. In the informal sector, we have been able to work around this and we have come up with a presumptive tax, although that will apply mainly to the States Internal Revenue Services; FIRS will also expect those agencies businesses to pay VAT. We are going to ensure that VAT actually serves the purpose for which it was created. Nigeria is now a trade-oriented nation, and we believe that in the near future a lot of internal capacity will come into play. While we are still very much an import-oriented organization, we believe the right amount of taxes should be paid so government can at least use the money to invest and ensure that it creates a conducive environment for internal production. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What impact will Lekki Free Zone have on the economy of Lagos State?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OTUNBA Olusegun JAWANDO</strong> The Lekki Free Zone is modeled after the free zones in China. We were especially impressed by the free zone in Nanjing in China, which is a mixed development free zone, which operates as a town with residential, commercial, industrial and recreational facilities. That is where the concept originated and why we choose Lekki. The land was largely undeveloped space before we moved in. The state government wanted to use it as a catalyst for developing the eastern part of the state. It will develop into an economic base and secondly, it will raise the social-economic standards of that area and create employment. We hoped to generate industrial investment to establish industrial manufacturing enterprises that generate employment and income. The state government is a major shareholder with the Chinese partners, so the state should receive revenue after some time, but primarily, the zone exists to develop the state's economy and initiate technology transfers. A lot of these companies will bring new manufacturing techniques and will employ Nigerians of differing skill levels. We also hope the zone's companies will utilize some basic raw materials from the community, the state, and the country in general, developing the wider economy. It will provide three levels of advantages; firstly, generating employment, secondly generating technological know-how and finally, triggering raw material production. </p><h4>Could you outline how the Lekki Free Zone came about and how it has developed Chinese-Nigerian bilateral relations?</h4><p><strong></strong><strong>DING YONGHUA</strong> In 2006, an agreement was signed between Lagos State Government and Lekki Worldwide Investment. This agreement brought together a Chinese consortium, including the China Railway Construction Corporation (CRCC), the Nan Ging Chow Ning Developers and the China Africa Development Fund. The fund is directed by the China National Development Bank, and it represents the Chinese government's investments in Africa and supports Chinese investors on the continent. The Chinese government promised African countries that it would establish cooperation zones in Africa and ask Chinese producers and manufacturers to invest in a country and help African countries raise standards, providing employment and technical transfer. We formulated a master plan, most of which was approved  by the state government. Our urban design is ongoing, and the plan for the tech farm area nearby is ready. When we first came here, this area was covered in forest and felt separated from Lagos. In China all the development zones are close to the city, so you can use the utility services, such as water and electricity; but here there was nothing, not even roads. We overcame a lot of difficulties to build necessary infrastructure, and this year we have completed a power plant and office buildings. There are some other projects that are under construction such as a police station, a custom processing center, an office complex, banks, supermarkets, coffee shop, and all the necessary facilities required by the investors.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Lekki Free Port development?</h4><p><span></span><strong>OSJ </strong>The Lagos, the Apapa, and Tin Can ports are already congested. The Lekki Free Port is going to be the deepest seaport in West Africa so it is going to be a major hub for port activities. A lot of the congestion at Apapa and Tin Can will be absorbed by the Lekki Free Port. In addition, a lot of the industries and establishments in the zone will depend on direct access to their freight. The proximity also has tremendous advantage in terms of avoiding delays, so we expect a symbiotic relationship between the port and the Lekki Free Zone. It is one of our selling points to investors, that we are just a few kilometers from the port.</p><p><span></span><strong>DY</strong> This year we have already had several investors sign agreements with us. These include Yulong Pipe, the steel mill, and other investors like the Truck SKD project, food factories, and a cotton mill. Next year, we expect even more. This year we have five newcomers, and next year, I expect 10 since the country's situation has improved. Currently we have some investors from Germany, the US, and Dubai negotiating with us. Today we are busy manufacturing factory components in China and shipping them here by container to assemble. By the end of next year they will begin construction. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>
	Can you tell us about the Eko Pearl Towers and how they came to be?
</h4><p>
	I have been in Nigeria since 1970. Following a period working for another company, I decided to strike out on my own. My initial business forays were into a restaurant, a poultry farm, and then a logistics company, after which I started a printing and packaging company. In 1999, I ventured into the exportation of cocoa, and in a year when the national export figure was 150,000 tons in total, I managed to export 55,000 tons single-handedly. This progression of trade put me in an increasingly strong position in the market. My operations were growing, and I delved into road and civil construction backed by my quarries. Further down the line, I became the main supplier of the many rocks that form the first reinforcement wall of Eko Atlantic City, a city created by Mr. Ronald Chagoury to protect Victoria Island from future erosion that has degraded the coastline around Lagos over the last decades. This project costs $600 million, and initially many had their doubts, but I had my share of supporters who saw its validity. The Towers project will be comprised exclusively of deluxe apartments and will be developed at land level on 22,700 sqm at the harbor front of Lagos' innovative Eko Atlantic City. The five Towers are a collection of two-bedroom, three-bedroom, and penthouse-type apartments with sea and marina views for residential and investment purposes only. The towers are named after the most precious pearls in the sea; Black, Champagne, Aqua, Indigo, and White. My investments have secured a valuable reputation regarding Eko Atlantic, and an increasing number of investors are aligning themselves with my projects. Construction and real estate are my main lines of businesses, and Eko Atlantic has done extremely well thus far, although it has not even scratched the surface of its potential.</p><h4>When you saw the plans for Eko Atlantic, what prompted you to take that risk from the very beginning?</h4><p>
	Nigeria is a land of opportunity begging to be believed in. All of the funds we have invested here, we invested with confidence. We believe in Eko Atlantic not only because of the people behind it; the Chagoury Group; His Excellency Mr. Gilbert, and Sheikh Ronald Chagoury, but also because it will become the future of Africa.</p><h4>How have you used your expertise in other areas to develop this project?</h4><p>
	Right now I run companies in the fields of piling, logistics, civil and road construction, real estate development, electro-mechanical engineering, industrial baking, ceramic manufacturing, and telecommunications. I never work alone; I use my personal expertise coupled with my very professional team. They provide me with briefings on a daily basis. In less than four years, another company that I own that manufactures tableware and ceramics will be the largest global producer of these products. Our ceramic products are already well established in markets such as the US, France, the UK, and most of the Arab countries. This year we are hoping to build yet another ceramic factory as we see a growing market.</p><h4>Following the most recent electoral successes, there seems to be a renewed interest in Nigeria. What have you noticed since the election?</h4><p>
	As a Nigerian, an expatriate, and an investor in the country, my perspective is multifaceted. I believe that the new government will open up the country, improve infrastructure, attract more foreign investment with confidence, and will better standard of living of Nigerians. President Muhammadu Buhari will ensure that this happens.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>
	Having spent most of my life in this beautiful country, I realize that Nigerians are the most resilient and optimistic people you may come across. In the coming year, I am convinced we will move forward to a better Nigeria and higher to a more positive level. I myself am moving forward with optimism and will be introducing to the market several new projects including a 37-floor corporate tower to rise from the sands of Eko Atlantic City. It will provide office space with restaurants and high-end retail shops. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Eko Atlantic is one of the continent's most significant development. What about it was attractive? </h4><p>We saw Eko Atlantic as an ambitious project and that, for us, marked it as a grand opportunity. At the site Eko Atlantic now occupies, formerly known as Bar Beach, there was significant erosion over the years that, as recently as 2005, threatened all of Victoria Island. Eko Atlantic resulted as a solution to protect the shoreline of Victoria Island and also to create a city that would be well-planned as well as developed in accordance with 21st-century best practices. Speaking from the perspective of investment, this project is a critical part of the transformation of Lagos, Nigeria, and Africa at large. As a result, Eko Development Company saw this as the perfect location to deploy our project, aptly named Azuri Peninsula.</p><h4>How will the legal differences from the rest of Lagos State, such as a free trade zone (FTZ), benefit not only Azuri Peninsula, but also the rest of Eko Atlantic?</h4><p>The FTZ, which is a federal government initiative, will give confidence to investors who want to live or transact business within Eko Atlantic. As a free trade zone, we will benefit from tax exemptions for materials that come into Eko Atlantic. We must bear in mind the impacts of these exemptions to the cost of construction as well as the finished product. From the perspective of a developer, that will give us reassurances that our projects will be competitive. If you take into account the cost of land and construction, one would expect our pricing to be exorbitant, but I can say that today that the cost of our finished project will be competitive with Victoria Island and Ikoyi in Lagos. The second consideration is that since Eko Atlantic City is governed by South Energyx, a municipality in its own right, and is exempt from the familiar day-to-day bureaucracy of Lagos State, and has its own streamlined system. The time line of projects are shortened with the stamp of approval from the government. Confidence is constantly being built, and there is a steady stream of work at Eko Atlantic on a daily basis. It is set to be the first in-mind interface of cross border transactions, and a transparent means of building foreign confidence in Nigeria. It will be a point of capital and intellectual inflow that is tailored to private sector needs and one that matches its pace.</p><h4>What stage is the Azuri Peninsula project currently at in terms of construction?</h4><p>We are currently engaged with the piling stages of the development, which we began in January of 2015. We have, however, completed piling works for the first tower (Orun), 236 of them to be precise, and are at about 90% along with the second tower (Oban), with just 20 more piles outstanding as at June 2nd, 2015. In terms of time line, we are on schedule and have begun making off-plan sales. By the end of 1Q2016, we will have finished the podium of the development</p><h4>Would reform in the petroleum industry be a boon to Azuri Peninsula?</h4><p>Most government initiatives will have some sort of impact either directly or indirectly. The Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), when passed, will have a positive impact on the industry. Nigeria is an energy producing country. However, only 20-30% of our GDP is funded by oil. If oil prices go up, there will be more liquidity and access to cash. I do not see the PIB as the only government initiative that will be of importance to us. With the new government in place, I want to believe that there will be more prudence, more initiative toward economic development, and growth that will help deepen our capital and money markets and thus translate into better access to much-needed funding such as development grants, loans, and mortgages.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year to come?</h4><p>There will be more economic stability and confidence in the market. The delivery date for Azuri Peninsula Phase I is 2018. We are currently on the drawing board for Phase II with smaller-sized apartments to cater to our clients. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Have you seen an increase in investment interest since President Buhari's election?</h4><p>In the past year and half, interest in the Eko Atlantic project has grown steadily. However, even with the increase in interest, it will take some time for this to translate into actual business. Individuals and corporate bodies are waiting to see how the government will modify its agenda and which types of projects will be prioritized. As soon as the buildings are completed, we will no longer require extensive marketing but that is not to say we will not be looking for more clients. At that point, people will begin to appreciate these new facilities and seek us out on their own.</p><h4>What are INTELS' plans for Eko Energy Estate, as part of the Eko Atlantic project?</h4><p>We have commenced Phase One, which entails the construction of the first three buildings. These are slated for completion by the end of 2017, each with a total planned capacity of 160 one-bedroom or 80 two-bedroom apartments, depending on clients' requirements. We plan to turn the entire 45 ha into a residential estate within the Eko Atlantic City. In order to maintain a certain level of output, we need infrastructural investments in Nigeria. It is expected that additional investments will commence early 2016. We are now witnessing a lifestyle change in Lagos and the Eko Atlantic will be a completely different type of development. There will be a high level of security as well as new infrastructure, which will ensure electricity and water supply. Two major issues in the country today are low standards of educational and a lack of medical facilities. Few people would consider bringing their families to a place where there are problems with sanitation and security. Nigeria already has a vital position on the African continent, and the commissioning of this major economic city will position us even better in this regard. Although the Orlean Invest Group plays a relatively minor part in the project, which is spearheaded by The Chagoury Group, we are very proud to be a part of it.</p><h4>Which other projects is your company involved in?</h4><p>Lagos is poised to become a huge market unrestricted to oil and gas, and the Eko Atlantic project will be accessible to many other industries. Over the next 20 to 30 years, organizations from many sectors will be welcomed in Lagos. The conditions here now are similar to those in South America back in the 1970s because we have the necessary manpower with the sufficient level of education to support the activities of these industries. All the major industries in South America, like the automotive industry, came into being in the 1970's and we expect to see a similar trend here in Nigeria. Eko Atlantic will be a special economic zone with an offering of new benefits including offshore banking, which is not currently offered in Nigeria. The project will garner a lot of interest and will in turn trigger a lot of opportunities far beyond the oil and gas industry.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In 2016, we hope to see an increase in investment activities and a continuous approval of major capital projects. The country requires a significant level of infrastructural development to enable the utilization of gas in the domestic market, as well as the generation of power and electricity. The government will need to make some important decisions in order to make this a reality. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Chagoury Group been involved with the Eko Atlantic project and the Nigerian economy in general?</h4><p>The group is linked with the evolution of the country. We have been in Nigeria for more than 40 years, which means we understand how this country has grown and changed. Because we have seen where the country and this city have come from, it is logical that it would become a financial center for Sub-Saharan Africa, and then eventually the continent. Therefore, Eko Atlantic was a logical step to develop real estate because there is a huge shortage in Nigeria today. That shortage is only going to increase over time, so it made sense to opt for a high-density city with high-rise buildings and the infrastructure that comes with it. By doing this we are setting a new standard for Nigeria and the region, and providing a platform for future growth.</p><h4>What are the implications of the 2015 election for Eko Atlantic?</h4><p>There has been political stability in Nigeria for much longer than just this latest phase. This election was a positive point and the transition was successful, but even the last few elections have been peaceful. For us, it is business as usual. Election years tend to be exceptional in the sense that we do see a different level of activity in the country, but other than that it is the same. We have seen a lot of strong interest from overseas investors since the election. Many people that are looking in from a distance perceived more political instability than existed. After the elections, we saw a strong rise in interest from overseas companies, funds, and investors almost overnight.</p><h4>What sets Eko Atlantic apart as a unique investment opportunity?</h4><p>First, we have already seen a strong evolution. In some cases values have already doubled since we first started selling land. That is a success in itself, and prices are continuing to rise. Many of the reports coming out show that there is a sharp increase in the middle, upper-middle, and high-income brackets in Nigeria. This opens the door to a lot of opportunities in real estate, particularly the need for the correct supply of retail property for the current demographic. The same applies to the other aspects of real estate. Looking further ahead as real estate develops, Nigeria is going to become a strong economy in the next 15 years with a growing population and a potential GDP of $1.5 trillion. In the last 10 years we have seen a sharp increase in real estate development in Lagos and that is only going to pick up over the next 15 years. Shanghai and Dubai are examples of the speed at which development can take place, and we will see similar growth in Lagos. Also this is a country where an almost non-existent mortgage industry is nonetheless developing quickly. All of this is compelling evidence in favor of Eko Atlantic. </p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>In Nigeria and worldwide, 2015 has been a difficult year. Problems in terms of commodities, oil prices, and Ebola all had an impact. The elections also affected business in the sense that there has been some level of waiting. Now post-election, we will start to see new policies start coming out for the country and more investment coming back into Nigeria. As a result I think 2016 will be a much busier year than 2015, which is good for the country and will be good for Eko Atlantic. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You had a successful career as a journalist before joining the President's team. How have your experiences in Nigeria helped you design a media strategy for President Buhari?</h4><p>I have spent 29 years in the media, on radio, television, and in print. Most recently, I was Managing Director of Sun Newspapers. In my current role in public relations and as a spokesman, I can always draw on that depth of experience. We have to fashion our media strategy around the activities of our principles, and the principles of the president are those of clarity and straightforwardness. Whatever he has said, he will stand by it and he will own up to whatever he has done. Upon taking office, the goals and commitments of President Buhari were clear, and he has worked consistently to make the government more transparent and accountable. These are some of the values that our media strategy seeks to emphasize. Our role as members of his media team is to represent him, present his views, and defend him when necessary, by providing clarification. We publicize what he is doing openly and honestly. Another important job in this media spectrum is to ensure that the conversation remains civil. Like in any country, the Nigerian media can sometimes be more civil, and my experience in the field helps me tackle political attacks.</p><h4> <br>News media is moving rapidly towards online and user-generated content. How are you addressing the young population of Nigeria who are increasingly accessing their news through the internet?</h4><p>I have a Facebook and Twitter page, and have since garnered tens of thousands of followers. We publish regular updates through these platforms and we are planning to advance our social media strategy significantly as the government settles. We are going to have a special assistant in charge of new media, who will coordinate a team that is focused on our online strategy. This means there is going to be considerably more engagement with young people and the population in general. Social media provides a unique opportunity for engagement, as people on these platforms feel closer to the presidential office than through more traditional mediums such as newspaper and television.</p><h4>You have made a point of publicizing the administration's steps and successes in the fight against corruption. How do you view the media strategy and its relationship to the process of justice?</h4><p>The process of justice is fairly straightforward. The president has said repeatedly that he will not charge anybody in court without obtaining evidence first. Anybody who is going to be charged with anything will have their day in court and be able to defend themselves. In our engagement, we seek to publicize the successes of the administration against corruption without jeopardizing investigations in any way. It is important to communicate a tough stance on corruption, because a great change in consciousness is needed across the country.</p><h4>How do you manage what comes out of Nigeria and what reaches the international community?</h4><p>We are the interface between the government and the public, and that public includes the international community. Our media releases go around the world, the international media is on our mailing list. We make consistent efforts to engage the international media during the President's visits abroad, and we stress the same principles of straightforwardness and honesty outside the country as we do inside. Internationally, this has been received very well. We also emphasize the opportunities that are present in Nigeria for international investors and businesspeople. The nation is on the doorstep of increased growth and prosperity, both things that this president will unlock.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I expect that we will use all the communication channels available to us to disseminate what the government is doing. We will not discount any particular channel; we will utilize all of them. Furthermore, our office will be growing. Presently there are two of us on the team, however we intend to have a number of special assistants joining us with specific briefs. We will not leave any stone unturned in communicating the administration's actions and intentions. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nigeria is among Belgium's largest trading partner in Africa, with trade volumes exceeding $2 billion. What future policies will allow commerce between the two countries to continue to grow and expand?</h4><p>The relations between both our countries have been intensified since the transition of Nigeria to democracy and it is the wish of my government to intensify them even more in the future, particularly in order to support investment initiatives in Nigeria. Belgium seeks to diversify and expand trade opportunities outside Europe. It has always been an internationally oriented country with a particular interest towards Africa. I am convinced that Belgian know-how in various industrial sectors, such as bioengineering in crops and cattle breeding, transport management, environmental protection, water sanitation, electricity generation and distribution can be of use for the development and diversification of the Nigerian economy. </p><h4>The recent election in Nigeria has provided opportunity for change in trade policy. How are Belgium and Nigeria's new administration expanding their ties, and how does the election strengthen Belgium's interests in the region?</h4><p>Belgium wants to encourage Nigeria, as a major powerhouse on the African continent and its biggest economy, to further position itself as a stabilizing influence on the continent in order to improve respect for democratic principles and rule of law, as is now happening in Nigeria itself. Nigeria is a country that wants to work hard on economic development and on diversification from petroleum and natural gas. President Muhammadu Buhari was elected on this platform, and Belgium, like so many countries around the world, congratulated him wholeheartedly on this historic election, as well as the Nigerian people for the exemplary way in which the election was held and its result respected.</p><h4>Nigeria and Belgium are both major centers for the maritime industry. How can trade between the two countries encourage the further development of Nigeria as a center of the shipping industry?</h4><p>The port of Antwerp, the second biggest port in Europe, played an important role at the beginning of Nigeria's port reform leading to the landlord model of port concession. Both the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Port of Antwerp are now strengthening their age-long collaboration even more. Moreover, two Belgian dredging companies are involved in important projects in the field of port development in Lagos and Port Harcourt. The land reclamation of the Eko Atlantic project in Lagos is being carried out by Dredging International, which is also involved in dredging projects near Bonny Island and Port Harcourt. Another Belgian dredging company, Jan De Nul, was contracted in 2015 for the land reclamation project, where Nigerian giant entrepreneur Aliko Dangote will build his petroleum refinery and fertilizer plant. Some Nigerian industries have shown a particular interest in the position Belgium takes as a center for shipping and maritime industry. For example, the Port Harcourt based Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company (NLNG) is exploring new business opportunities in Europe. It goes without saying that we would welcome cooperation between NLNG and the port of Zeebrugge, which is a major liquid natural gas hub in Europe.</p><h4>Belgium is the 3rd largest European exporter to Nigeria. How are Belgian companies being encouraged to invest and do business in Nigeria?</h4><p>Around 50 Belgian companies visited Nigeria in 2014 during a trade mission organized by “Flanders Investment &amp; Trade“, one of our regional foreign trade agencies. This mission has led to increased opportunities. There was a particular focus on sectors that are important for the development of Nigeria, such as natural resources, agriculture and food processing, health, construction, infrastructure, (renewable) energy, telecommunication, port development, water supply and sanitation. It is not a coincidence that these are sectors for which the Nigerian government receives financing from international development banks, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank. As such, incentives for Nigeria become opportunities for our companies, and Belgian business with Nigeria leads to further development across the board. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In the last ten years, bilateral trade between Nigeria and South Africa has strengthened enormously, providing an example of the developing force of intra-African partnerships. What initiatives have driven this growth over the last few years?</h4><p>South Africa regards Nigeria as one of its most important partners on the African continent in pursuing the vision of Africa's renewal. In this regard, South Africa views its relationship with Nigeria as an enduring “strategic partnership," centered on the advancement of the African agenda. In 1999, South Africa and Nigeria established a structured bilateral mechanism, the Bi-National Commission (BNC). At its inception, the primary objective of the partnership was to anchor and strengthen the existing bilateral, historical, political, economic, and social relations between the two countries, which would invariably also benefit other countries on the continent. The BNC further serves to promote trade and investment. The two countries have since signed more than 34 bilateral agreements and MoUs, which are coordinated through the BNC and in turn are led by the respective deputy and vice presidents of both countries. With its large population and vast natural resources, especially oil and gas, Nigeria is South Africa's key trading partner on the continent providing significant opportunities for its exports and investments. There are over 100 South African companies doing business in Nigeria in various sectors, mainly telecommunication, banking, retail, property, entertainment, and hospitality. Nigeria is one of the few countries that enjoys a positive trade balance with South Africa.</p><h4>How can African nations work together to develop a policy response to the new status quo, particularly in terms of regional economic integration?</h4><p>In our view economic integration encompasses three pillars, i.e. market integration, infrastructure development, and continental industrialization. Continental integration efforts are being intensified through the negotiation of the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement. Africa is made up of five economic regional communities and these structures are tasked with negotiating a much closer working relationship which would ultimately lead to an Africa-wide Free Trade Agreement, with a potential single market of over 1 billion people. Considerable progress has been made in the negotiations, which aim to integrate 26 countries of eastern and southern Africa. This involves a population of nearly 600 million people and a combined GDP of $1 trillion. This market scale could launch a sizable part of the continent on a new developmental trajectory. There is a need to redefine and to strengthen our partnerships on the continent towards realizing the vision of an integrated Africa, underpinned by greater levels of intra-Africa trade and even greater levels of intra-Africa investments. African countries need to trade among themselves and there are good programs through various organs of the African Union aimed at promoting trade amongst Africans within the continent and to promote regional integration.</p><h4>What opportunities are there for investors in African infrastructure?</h4><p>South Africa's imports from Nigeria are comprised mainly of oil and gas. Since 1999, there has been an increase in the number of SA multinationals operating in the Nigerian market. Currently, there are estimated to be more than 100 South African companies doing business in Nigeria. The biggest investment by South African companies in Nigeria has been in the telecommunication sector. Statistically, Nigeria is the biggest source of tourist origin, contributing about 84,589 tourist arrivals into South Africa in 2013. Nigeria alone contributed about 64% of the total tourist arrivals from the West Africa Region in 2013. Lack of access to trade-enabling infrastructure on our continent is a fundamental challenge. There is increasing recognition that Africa's integration and intra-Africa trade cannot be realized without concerted efforts to invest in Africa's infrastructure and manufacturing sectors. We have an extensive infrastructure development program championed by the heads of state and government through the Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative. We want to continue building infrastructure such as roads, railways, bridges, dams, and airports to make it easier to travel around the continent. The African heads of states have committed themselves to continue building cross-border infrastructure, to unlock growth and development in our continent. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your role in Nigerian history has helped to produce the nation we know today. What does democracy mean for you?</h4><p>Democracy is more than just an election. Democracy must involve popular participation, not just by getting people to vote once in four years or once in five years, but popular participation in social life, in economic life, and in the political life of the country. It must involve fundamental freedoms, including freedom of speech, freedom of choice, and freedom from physical harassment. But underlying these freedoms there must also be security: food security, employment security, and security of life and property. Democracy to me must embrace all of this.</p><h4>After your release from prison you became president on May 29th, 1999, a day now known as Democracy Day in Nigeria. How did you feel?</h4><p>That was less than one year after I was released from prison. I was meant to die in prison because Abacha told a number of people that I would not come out of detention alive. Two of my compatriots did not come out alive. Only the grace of God saved me. When I got out my economic and social life was in disarray. My egg farm's production had decreased from 5,000 trays of eggs to 200 trays by the time I came back from prison. My NGO had to move to exile in Ghana because Abacha wanted to destroy it. My children had stopped going to school because they couldn't pay the school fees. At first I didn't want to contest the election, but my supporters convinced me to. I went through with the election campaign, winning almost two-thirds of the votes cast. The result of that election vindicated me completely. It helped me put the humiliation of prison behind me and think only of the future. Having been head of state before and having had a sabbatical period when I was imprisoned made me very motivated to reform the country and work for stability. For example, I was one of the founding members of Transparency International.</p><h4>When you left office, Nigeria had paid all its foreign-debt, entering an age of stability. What is your vision for the future development of Nigeria?</h4><p>Leadership and development are key. Development starts with human capital, meaning education, health, and agriculture should always be the foundation of the state. Then comes infrastructure in the form of roads, electricity, communication, transportation, and water. These are things that you have to do concurrently. Then, of course, you are not in isolation. You are part of the world. And so your relationship with the world also has to go hand in hand with human capital and infrastructure. You must have a leadership that facilitates agricultural growth together with industry or manufacturing and the growth of these together with both local and foreign investment, and finally hand-in-hand with human capital development.</p><h4>How can Nigeria achieve its potential in the years to come?</h4><p>When I came up with Vision 2020, Nigeria was the second largest economy in Africa. I sat down with all our economic experts, economic ministries, and the Central Bank and we came to the conclusion that certain things had to be done. There are about seven or eight indicators that can help us improve on where we are now. And since we have done it before, we have shown it is not impossible. If, in four years, we can almost double the key commodities in commercial production then we can do what needs to be done again. When we were growing our economy in the four boom years, agricultural growth was at about 7% per annum; the total economy was growing at about 7.5% per annum. It wasn't driven by oil production, as oil was growing at 3%. It can be done and all we need to do is to make sure that the correct policies are in place. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What drove your decision to run for President again?</h4><p>I went through the rigors of four presidential elections in 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015, because I fervently believe in democracy as the best method of governance. I had ruled as a military head of state between 1984 and 1985, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union, I became convinced that democracy was the correct form of government. I joined partisan politics in 2002, and ran for President in 2003. There is no way one can honestly solve major problems in a country without being part of the national decision making process. I ran three times, and thought I won, but the electoral commission said I did not. I challenged these results in the Supreme Court three times, but the judgments went against me. For the fourth time, I ran as part of a coalition. Three major political parties and part of a fourth one came together and formed a formidable party called the All Progressives Congress (APC). We ran, and won the election. To paraphrase the saying, it was fourth time lucky. What kept me going was the conviction that Nigeria can be better administered, and that its resources can be used for the betterment of its people. That is what we have resolved to do now.</p><h4>Why was the formation of the cabinet delayed?</h4><p>The cabinet was not constituted until November, and although we were sworn into office in May 2015, there were a lot of changes to be made before we could enter office. Foundations had to be laid for the bureaucracy, for governance, and we needed to chart a new and different direction which emphasized probity, transparency, and accountability. If we had not taken our time to relay the foundation, no enduring change would come. I decided to hold my position in the Ministry of Petroleum, because I have requisite experience in that area, having held the same position in the 1970s under the Olusegun Obasanjo military regime. I believe I have a fair knowledge of the industry, and that I can revitalize the sector once again. In preceding years, the oil sector had become characterized by dishonesty and corruption, with no sense of accountability. It was the country's cash cow, but now oil prices are down, and I knew that if I was in the position of President, the least I could do would be to utilize my experience for the benefit of the country. There were no legal impediments to taking this dual role.</p><h4>What have been your greatest achievement in your new role so far?</h4><p>It is difficult to say what has been our most important accomplishment over the past year. We campaigned on three major platforms, and we have been actively working on these issues during our tenure. We identified national security, providing jobs for unemployed, particularly the youth, and fighting corruption as our core objectives. At this stage we are content with our progress. We are on course, judging by the stated objectives, and we are proceeding with our agenda successfully.</p><h4>What is your administration's policy toward national security?</h4><p>Security is one of our key focuses, and we will never rest on our oars when it comes to making our country safe. In 2016 we will continue to concentrate our attention on this critical task. You cannot govern a country whose borders are not secure, so we will ensure that violent insurgency, particularly in the northeast of the country, is completely subdued, while other forms of criminality like armed robbery, kidnapping, and vandalism of public utilities are prevented. Our security agencies will be funded, trained, and equipped to meet these challenges.</p><h4>How do you intend to respond to depressed oil prices?</h4><p>Nigeria has depended on oil as the mainstay of its economy for too long. We paid lip service to the concept of diversifying the economy, but now this has become a matter of great urgency, and requires practical and effective steps for its implementation. With the lowered price of oil on the international market, we must look to other areas if our economy is not to collapse completely. Agriculture and solid minerals are sectors in which we are blessed, and we are poised to harness our potential by appointing highly competent people in these industries. We are giving all the necessary support in the financial and technical spheres, and apart from the self-sufficiency these sectors can give us as a country, they also have the capacity of taking hundreds of thousands of young people out of unemployment. We have our priorities clearly laid out, and we shall achieve them.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of Nigeria?</h4><p>The future is in the hands of God, but we believe He will help us to bring enduring change to our country. In the years ahead, we look forward to creating a more prosperous Nigeria, one in which corruption no longer holds sway and people are happy and affluent. We want a country where the resources of the land are used for the good of the people, one which can hold its head up high in the comity of nations. We will get there, because we trust in God. We will do our part, and the divine powers will also help us. </p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the recent highlights on the stock exchange?</h4><p>KASE is the only stock exchange in Kazakhstan, providing a platform for trade in a variety of financial instruments including stocks, bonds, derivatives, and foreign currencies. We have become more internationally focused and oriented this year. We decided to be proactive in spheres like the international financial markets in order to prepare a framework for the International Financial Center Astana project. Along the way, we have been discussing our development with a number of other stock exchanges, such as London Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, Intercontinental Exchange, and other leading exchanges. We also explore opportunities for fostering renewable energy investments in Central Asia via participation with foreign partners. Our primary task is to increase the attractiveness of the capital markets in Kazakhstan. This will happen in part through a government privatization plan, which is currently under development by the government and the sovereign wealth fund. According to the plan, more than 35 companies are going to be transferred from the government to the private sector. KASE has already launched a new listing sector with specified listing requirements for high-tech companies and is going to set up special listing requirements for subsoil companies. All our projects respond to market demand and are moving in line with development trends in the country. KASE also attracts potential issuers within the framework of the Listing Partners Advisory Initiative (LPAI). As part of this, we collaborate with professional consulting companies, organizing consulting sessions concerning fundraising opportunities on stock markets for potential issuers in different regions of Kazakhstan, in cooperation with the local Akimats and the regional chambers of commerce. One of the most significant events this year for KASE is joining the Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative (SSE Initiative) organized under the auspices of the UN. Being a part of this outstanding project provides KASE access to the global experience in implementing best practices to improve the sustainability of the local capital markets. A total of 29 stock exchanges from different parts of the world are a part of this initiative.</p><h4>In 2015, you allowed the first transaction in yuan. What was behind this move?</h4><p>Investors can now trade with yuan, in addition to US dollars, ruble, and euros. As we are seeing a surge of trade between Kazakhstan and China, there was also a need for this currency exchange option. We organized yuan-tenge operations to be posted on the stock exchange. Compared to the Chinese market, the volume is tiny, but it is growing. These currency operations will increase in volume in the future because trade between Kazakhstan and China is growing. By means of launching the trade in Chinese yuan on KASE, a simplification in the mutual conversion is planned, which is an important factor to increase the trade between two countries. Recently, we held a China-Central Asia capital markets forum, during which KASE has signed an MoU with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p><h4>What level of interest is KASE seeing from international investors?</h4><p>We have met with several international stock exchanges and we are now trying to see how we can increase awareness among global investors. Another crucial aspect of our development is to increase our transparency in order to help international investors in obtaining all necessary information they need for the related investment decision. There are more than 130 companies listed on KASE, but very few of them are liquid. The KASE index consists of stocks of nine leading companies in Kazakhstan. We have an interactive and informative site that offers all necessary information about our stocks, and we are also working closely with Bloomberg and Reuters to increase our visibility. KASE has recently been classified as “Frontier" by MSCI and S&amp;P Dow Jones, and working towards inclusion into the FTSE frontier market indexes.</p><h4>How is the stock exchange overcoming the challenges of low oil prices and currency devaluation?</h4><p>Although there are more than 100 companies listed on KASE with either shares or bonds, the market capitalization is only around 12% GDP of Kazakhstan, which is low in comparison with other domestic markets, where this indicator reaches 30-40% and 500-800% in international financial centers. Currently, there is a significant outflow of investors from emerging markets both here and elsewhere. The current exchange rate of the tenge is established by demand. After depreciation in the tenge the cost of investments for foreign companies working in Kazakhstan and using the tenge becomes beneficial when they export goods in dollars to other countries. It makes Kazakhstan a more attractive place for investment. The free-floating local currency by itself cannot attract foreign investors. That said, the cost of some assets decreased due to the devaluation, and theoretically investors should be keen on investing in such assets. In reality, we see that the key indicator for investors is trust in the local currency and predictability of its behavior, and that drives them to invest in assets nominated in it. On a separate note, share market trading volumes have shown a drastic increase of 774.5% due to the placement of KazMunayGas JSC shares, while market capitalization increased almost threefold, from $21 billion on August 5th 2015 to $61 billion on August 6th. This placement accounts for 85.8% of the trading volume in the first nine months of 2015. However, we need to improve market stability and reduce volatility. We expect that after big shocks and moves, there will be a period of stabilization, and later a period of growth.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Above all, we have plans for the development of the KASE within the International Financial Center Astana. It has the potential to become a major financial hub for the Central Asian region, with English as its official language and English law as a governing rule. It will be established based on the Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) model, focusing on capital markets, asset management, private banking, and Islamic finance. It will provide its participants special tax exemptions and other benefits. In close cooperation with our colleagues from Dubai we aim to reach new heights for the subsequent sustainable development of KASE.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the key achievements at KOC over the year 2015?</h4><p>KOC has made significant achievements in 2015 on our path toward the 2020 production capacity target of 3.65 million bpd. We have increased production capacity by more than 240 million bpd through an extensive production optimization program. In a significant milestone achievement, we are proud as well to have signed the first heavy oil contract in KOC's history, in January 2015, for the construction of a central facility that will handle production from the Lower Fars reservoir in Kuwait. After its commissioning in 2018, heavy oil production from this reservoir will reach 60 million bpd. We have also successfully commissioned the new Gathering Center 16 in West Kuwait, which will support our goals of maintaining production capacity in this area. We have begun an intensification of our exploratory program, resulting in the discovery of new reserves, such as the Riksah field in January 2015 and the Mauddud in Bahra field in February 2015. These discoveries, and others, allow KOC to replace produced reserves. Lastly, over the course of 2015, we have successfully achieved a reduction in gas flaring to less than 1% of total gas produced in April 2015. This is considered a historical milestone, as it is the lowest in KOC history.</p><h4>What are the major ongoing projects for KOC currently?</h4><p>KOC is implementing a comprehensive capital investment program for the next five years that will allow us to increase our production capacity in line with our 2020 plan. There are several key projects that are key to realizing this aim, one being the implementation of an intensive drilling program—an estimated 400-500 wells will be drilled per year—for the next five years, including the application of the latest drilling technologies to maximize recovery from our reservoirs. Our drilling rig fleet at KOC has been increased in order to cope with this increase and efficiencies of our drilling operations are being optimized to achieve even more of an increase in the future. We have also embarked on two major field development programs focused on water injection plans in West Kuwait in order to maintain the current 500 million bpd production capacity of the area and increase it beyond current levels to 550 million bpd. In addition, there are three major development programs ongoing in the South and East Kuwait area, including a major water injection facility and a new gathering center to assist in S&amp;EK of that area, maintaining its 1,700 million bpd production capacity target. In the North Kuwait area, we have started three major development programs, including three new gathering centers and another water injection facility to increase the conventional oil production capacity to 1 million bpd. We have begun the development of Phase I of the heavy oil program to reach a production level of 60 million bpd in the Lower Fars reservoir, a program that includes a heavy oil production facility, transit pipeline, as well as the associated export facilities. We are moving even closer toward our goal of bringing oil production to more than 350 million bpd and non-associated gas to 1 billion cubic feet per day by 2022 with the development of the second and third phases of the North Kuwait Jurassic reserves, a major step forward in our long-term strategy. In the interim, KOC is developing three Jurassic production facilities to expedite the development of the Jurassic reserves over 2017. On the exploration side of our strategy, we have implemented an intensive exploration program, aimed at replacing produced hydrocarbons and growing our reserves base. This program includes several 2D and 3D seismic surveys that cover the entire area of Kuwait, both on-shore and offshore, and is combined with an intensive drilling program to support it. Considering our storage capacity and export facilities, we are expanding in these areas as well to accommodate for the increasing volumes of oil we expect for export to international markets.</p><h4>What role does international cooperation play in KOC's strategy?</h4><p>International cooperation is very important for KOC to achieve our strategic goals. As we move to develop heavy oil and non-associated gas production, and as we enter offshore exploration and development, and moving toward tertiary production techniques in our conventional crude oil reservoirs, the participation of IOCs through Enhanced Technical Service Agreements (ETSA) will add significant value that will support KOC in the long term. We already have an ETSA with an IOC to support the development of non-associated gas production in the Jurassic reservoirs located in North Kuwait, and we look forward to starting additional ETSAs with other international companies to support other projects within KOC in the near future.</p><h4>What are the most prominent challenges facing Kuwait's oil sector moving forward?</h4><p>Amongst our challenges, we focus on delivery of our capital projects on time, finding skilled manpower to develop new projects, and the application of technologies that are new to us in the development of challenging reserves such as heavy oil and Jurassic gas. Support from external approval bodies to KOC is of critical importance.</p><h4>What are the changing employment demands of the oil and gas business, and where do you see the greatest need for further human capital development in Kuwait's oil industry?</h4><p>Future challenges appear in the rising demand for the application of new technologies, additional drilling activities, and increasing well surveillance activities and operations. This demands more employment in the technical fields. The greatest need lies in the demand of experienced employees, such as the ones who have experience in enhanced oil recovery processes.  Our need for experienced manpower is directly proportional to the growing capital investments and complexity of our operations, which is becoming more and more demanding in the coming few years.</p><h4>How do you see supply and demand evolving in the oil industry globally in the near future, and what role will Kuwait's oil play in the global energy mix?</h4><p>We expect that global oil consumption will continue increasing through the coming years, and reach around 110 million bpd by 2040 from current consumption of approximately 92 million bpd. Main consumption growth will take place in India, China, and the Middle East. Middle East OPEC countries will play a significant role in providing the required increment in production capacity to supply this oil demand increase. Our advantage of having one of the lowest oil production and development costs in the world, together with the continued implementation of our strategic plan, will keep placing Kuwait as one of the most important oil producers in the region and worldwide. We will continue building our production capacity as per our 2020 strategy to ensure that we continue maintaining our position as a reliable crude oil supplier to the international market in the short and long term.</p><h4>What are your expectations for KOC in 2016?</h4><p>Next year, KOC expects to increase its production capacity of crude oil to more than 3 billion bpd, and 200 million cubic feet per day of free gas. The WARA Pressure Maintenance Program, a secondary recovery project in South &amp; East Kuwait, and the Booster Station—171 in West Kuwait will be fully commissioned. The Marine fleet and facilities modernization will be completed as well as a pipelines project to feed fuel to the Ministry of Electricity and Water power plants will commissioned. In addition, we are looking forward to inaugurate the new Ahmadi Hospital to serve oil sector employees and their families and the new Oil Sector Display Center in the Ahmadi Township.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What approach are you undertaking to increase the investment flow between Ghana and Dubai?</h4><p>We have been attending a number of conventions, conferences, and forums in Dubai. At the Dubai International Convention Center both public and private Ghanaian institutions attended to promote our country and make Ghana better understood for investors in the Middle East and in Dubai in particular. This is all part of the process through which improved trade and investment ties could take place. Secondly, Dubai Chamber itself looked all over Africa and decided that Ghana was the ideal location to open an office. The office has encouraged regular visits from Dubai officials to look into where both countries can work together. We have also established a full consulate general that replaces the former honorary consul, with Ghanaian foreign service officers now stationed here to facilitate visa applications and any other information that companies in Dubai require about Ghana. That is also an important step in strengthening diplomatic, political, and business relations between companies from Dubai and Ghana. We ourselves at the Ministry of Trade and Industry have been negotiating for more than nine months with a very well known Dubai developer, which has been considering a billion-dollar investment in a major area of Accra to develop a mixed-use complex involving convention and conference centers, hotels, entertainment, and more. Negotiations have not gone as well as I would have expected by now, but if they decide not to do it, there are many other big Dubai developers whom we are open to working with on this project.</p><h4>What role can Ghana play in ensuring food security for Dubai?</h4><p>Ghana, like most African countries, has a lot of arable land that is either underutilized or completely unutilized. When you fly over European countries, you get a sense of just how organized their agricultural production is. There are very clearly defined boundaries between different properties, and also between the land that is being cultivated, the land that is being harvested, the land that lies fallow, and so on. Most African countries do not have that kind of organization and demarcation. Therefore, a lot more could be done to improve our agricultural sector and processes of production in that respect. The Middle East is unfortunately not the most fertile region, whereas Ghana has produce in abundance. East Africa is much closer to Dubai, so they probably supply much of the produce that they consume in the UAE, but with Emirates flying everyday to Ghana and back, it could use cargo planes to export back to the UAE and Dubai fruits and vegetables that are needed in every family and person's diet there. There is huge potential for cooperation and trade in the agricultural sector, and also in the light manufacturing and assembly industry, whether it is based on technology from this area, or SE Asia, or Europe. Dubai businessmen can act as financiers, put in the equity for those projects, and play a middleman role to bring in Indian, Chinese, North European, and other investors to do business in Africa, which Dubai would also benefit from. There is also potential for the mineral sector, whereby oil and gas downstream industries are waiting in all of Africa, and in Ghana as well, with fertilizer plants, urea and ammonia plants, plastics plants, and so on. All of these are areas where Dubai companies can invest in Ghana and allow us to produce goods and services that are needed throughout Africa and the Middle East.</p><h4>What area has the biggest potential for cooperation between Ghana and Dubai in the coming years?</h4><p>Property development is the biggest area for partnership at the moment. Dubai is world famous for their iconic buildings, high-class structures, state-of-the-art architecture, and designs. In Africa, our structures have grown out rather than up. That means our infrastructure resources are very far stretched over a huge area, be it water, electricity, sewage, or roads. We can learn from Dubai about growing vertically, rather than growing out horizontally. Besides the major convention and conference center project I mentioned, we are also hoping other Dubai developers will come and help us build middle- and low-class conventional real estate, shopping malls, and so on, for the large and ever increasing population of consumers in Ghana.</p><h4>What opportunities exist in knowledge and cultural exchange between both nations?</h4><p>Dubai has diversified its reputation from hard business, logistics, airlines, shipping, and so on to also entertainment and sports. Ghana is also a very accomplished sporting country, so there is a lot we can do with Dubai for sports and cultural and educational exchanges. Ghana has one of the highest per capital levels of education. It is no coincidence that Kofi Annan, the only ever Sub-Saharan African General Secretary of the UN, was from Ghana. We have many people like that with reputable backgrounds and experience. There are many opportunities for exchange education, and we are encouraging Dubai companies to set up schools and universities here. There is also potential in medical tourism. There are people in West Africa who may not be able to fly out to Dubai to get treated, but if a Dubai healthcare company decided to set up a medical center, that could cater to many people throughout this region. So there is a lot of potential for increased trade and relations between our two nations.</p><h4>What sort of advantages and ease does Ghana offer investors in terms of regulations?</h4><p>Most investors want an easy place they can invest in, which means they want to be able get their visas easily and get their companies registered smoothly and rapidly, and they want to get their licenses as soon as possible. They want clear rules, transparency, consistency, security, and safety. Most importantly, they want to be able to employ reliable, hard-working, productive, dependable people. Ghana has this. Ghana is also a place you can relax, have fun, and enjoy yourself. Ghanaians work hard but they also know how to enjoy life. So Ghana is well placed for investors. We have good schools and hospitals for expats and their children, all internationally recognized and certified. We also have all the technologies and interconnectivity that enables you to transfer funds easily and conduct your finances throughout the country and worldwide and without too much paperwork.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Nigeria is among Belgium's largest trading partner in Africa, with trade volumes exceeding $2 billion. What future policies will allow commerce between the two countries to continue to grow and expand?</h4><p>The relations between both our countries have been intensified since the transition of Nigeria to democracy and it is the wish of my government to intensify them even more in the future, particularly in order to support investment initiatives in Nigeria. Belgium seeks to diversify and expand trade opportunities outside Europe. It has always been an internationally oriented country with a particular interest towards Africa. I am convinced that Belgian know-how in various industrial sectors, such as bioengineering in crops and cattle breeding, transport management, environmental protection, water sanitation, electricity generation and distribution can be of use for the development and diversification of the Nigerian economy.</p><h4>The recent election in Nigeria has provided opportunity for change in trade policy. How are Belgium and Nigeria's new administration expanding their ties, and how does the election strengthen Belgium's interests in the region?</h4><p>Belgium wants to encourage Nigeria, as a major powerhouse on the African continent and its biggest economy, to further position itself as a stabilizing influence on the continent in order to improve respect for democratic principles and rule of law, as is now happening in Nigeria itself. Nigeria is a country that wants to work hard on economic development and on diversification from petroleum and natural gas. President Muhammadu Buhari was elected on this platform, and Belgium, like so many countries around the world, congratulated him wholeheartedly on this historic election, as well as the Nigerian people for the exemplary way in which the election was held and its result respected.</p><h4>Nigeria and Belgium are both major centers for the maritime industry. How can trade between the two countries encourage the further development of Nigeria as a center of the shipping industry?</h4><p>The port of Antwerp, the second biggest port in Europe, played an important role at the beginning of Nigeria's port reform leading to the landlord model of port concession. Both the Nigerian Ports Authority and the Port of Antwerp are now strengthening their age-long collaboration even more. Moreover, two Belgian dredging companies are involved in important projects in the field of port development in Lagos and Port Harcourt. The land reclamation of the Eko Atlantic project in Lagos is being carried out by Dredging International, which is also involved in dredging projects near Bonny Island and Port Harcourt. Another Belgian dredging company, Jan De Nul, was contracted in 2015 for the land reclamation project, where Nigerian giant entrepreneur Aliko Dangote will build his petroleum refinery and fertilizer plant. Some Nigerian industries have shown a particular interest in the position Belgium takes as a center for shipping and maritime industry. For example, the Port Harcourt based Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Company (NLNG) is exploring new business opportunities in Europe. It goes without saying that we would welcome cooperation between NLNG and the port of Zeebrugge, which is a major liquid natural gas hub in Europe.</p><h4>Belgium is the 3rd largest European exporter to Nigeria. How are Belgian companies being encouraged to invest and do business in Nigeria?</h4><p>About 50 Belgian companies visited Nigeria in 2014 during a trade mission organized by “Flanders Investment &amp; Trade", one of our regional foreign trade agencies. This mission has led to increased opportunities. There was a particular focus on sectors that are important for the development of Nigeria, such as natural resources, agriculture and food processing, health, construction, infrastructure, (renewable) energy, telecommunication, port development, water supply and sanitation. It is not a coincidence that these are sectors for which the Nigerian government receives financing from international development banks, such as the World Bank and the African Development Bank. Incentives for Nigeria therefore become opportunities for our companies, and Belgian business with Nigeria leads to further development of Nigerian industries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Hotel Istana recently changed its tagline to “The City's Centre." What other changes have you implemented since assuming the role of General Manager last year?</h4><p>First, we have converted our second-floor shopping area into meeting rooms and we now have an additional five more meeting rooms, Opal, Ruby, Jasper, Kumala, and Mira. They are the favorites of our regular guests and very suitable for smaller-sized meetings and training. Second, we converted our old Japanese restaurant into a Japanese lounge called “Iyashi Lounge" for our Japanese guests, and they can check-in and check-out there, as well as enjoy their Japanese breakfast every morning. We have a Japanese Guest Relations Manager who caters to the needs of our Japanese guests. We also have a Japanese Director of Sales who looks after our Japanese business accounts. Third, we opened a corporate lounge for our corporate guests, where guests can check-in and check-out and receive a personalized and dedicated service. Our corporate guests don't have to stand in line at the main reception to check-in anymore and they just love this experience.</p><h4>What trends in RevPAR and occupancy rates have you observed and are these in line with general industry trends?</h4><p>Most hotels are having challenges with occupancy and average room rate trends that are below the levels of 2013 and 2014. The impact on tourism from airline tragedies, decline in Chinese tourists, implementation of GST, and the continuity of the negative trends noticed by 60% of hoteliers suggested that there would be further decline in 2015. However, we started to look at other markets a long time back and we are quite happy to see some refreshing trends coming in 2016 and 2017.</p><h4>What proportion of the hotel's guests does the business segment account for and how are you working to capture more visitors from the growing MICE market?</h4><p>About 34% of our business is from the corporate and MICE market. We have made changes in our product to attract more corporate business. We are also tapping MICE markets in Australia, India, and ASEAN for opportunities.</p><h4>Hotels are increasingly using social media as part of their marketing strategy. How is Hotel Istana exploiting these new tools of communication?</h4><p>Like most hotels, we are actively using Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and even LinkedIn as part of our marketing strategies to market and promote our brand. We also use a system called Revinate, which allows us to respond to the market immediately. This system integrates our online and survey feedbacks with guest data in one platform; hence, we are able to understand our guests' needs, likes, and dislikes about our property. This will then help us to make decisions based on comprehensive guest insights.</p><h4>Malaysia is hoping to increase revenue per visitor as part of the Malaysia Tourism Transformation Plan. What policies can be pursued to attract higher margin tourism?</h4><p>The weakened ringgit is a golden opportunity to promote the country as an attractive destination for tourists. Waiving of visas for Chinese visitors should also be considered as Chinese tourists are big spenders.</p><h4>How would you assess the effectiveness of the Malaysia Year of Festivals 2015 (MYFEST 2015) campaign?</h4><p>The campaign has been successful as we have been participating in various overseas trade shows and found that Malaysia is on the international map and is recognized by many as one of the preferred tourist destination in the Asian region.</p><h4>What are your specific goals for Hotel Istana?</h4><p>Since I embarked, we have worked very hard to improve and enhance our creative product offering through continuous improvement and we will continue to work in this area. We have implemented very high levels of training standards at the hotel and our associates are enjoying learning new concepts and skills that help them deliver first-class service to our guests. This can be seen from our independent quality scores, where we rank number 1 in our comp set of hotels. We continue to work hard in exploring new business opportunities in new and emerging markets and this will be a continuous journey to ensure occupancy and RevPAR goals are achieved.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main reforms offering more investment security and better risk management for private companies entering the market in DRC?</h4><p>The physical security issues that we had have been resolved by strengthening community consultation to avoid new conflicts and problems arising. We have also passed new legislation that gives more guarantees to investors. This is part of the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) system that protects investors. The DRC is also party to a relevant New York Convention and to OHADA. This is a common system used by 16 African countries whereby if a party is not satisfied with local justice, they can conduct proceedings outside the country, and we agree to respect the outcome. These mechanisms give more of a guarantee to investors. Furthermore, we have created some national institutions to protect investors and to ameliorate the business climate in the DRC. We have a group that meets two times a year to identify and consider problems relating to business activities. If there are policy, administration, or security shortfalls affecting business, then that group makes recommendations for improvements. We have also established the National Agency for Investment Promotion (ANAPI) to promote investment. Now it only takes three days and a fee of $120 to obtain all the necessary documentation to create a new company in the DRC. We have done all this to attract investors.</p><h4>What are the key areas for the economy's diversification in which you are seeking more foreign investment?</h4><p>In 2014 GDP growth was 9.5%, but in 2015 I predict a rate closer to 7.7% because of problems related to the cost of raw materials. The DRC exports mining resources and the price of these is dropping on the global market. We also have an energy shortage problem. The Grand Inga Dam project on the Congo river will produce around 100,000 MW of electricity. We are looking at how to utilize that and share it with other countries, such as South Africa, Egypt, and other countries that need that energy. In terms of the country's economic situation, the DRC is looking at how to diversify its economy because, currently, our GDP is essentially dependent on the mining, agriculture, and banking sectors. We aim to make agriculture our number one sector because we have 80 million ha of arable land and we have the advantage that 70% of our population is already involved in agriculture. Therefore, if we develop the agricultural sector, GDP growth will have a positive impact on a wide segment of our population. Infrastructure, factories, and industry are needed, particularly in agriculture, to modernize the sector. In the meantime, the mining sector only involves a small group of investors. Our mining legislation allows investors to recover their entire investment before they have to pay any contribution to the state. That is why while we have high mining profits. However, these do not directly benefit the population at the moment. The government has to wait around five to eight years for mining interests to start paying contributions to the state. We also have to start extracting more oil as studies indicate that three-quarters of the country bear petroleum reserves.</p><h4>What advantages does the agriculture sector specifically offer to investors based in Dubai?</h4><p>We have implemented an approach that gives more advantages to investors. They only have to pay $120 to open a company, they have customized facilities, and they do not have to pay anything to the government until they have recuperated the capital they have invested. Furthermore, we have a good climate in the DRC that allows for seasonal production year round.</p><h4>What benefits do you see in strengthening bilateral ties with Dubai?</h4><p>Dubai is a hub and it can facilitate us in making contact with investors. Dubai is a gateway for us. Currently we buy a number of things from Dubai. We import 3,000 containers from Dubai per month, but we could do more than that. Dubai gives us access to big investors interested in key areas for DRC's diversification, like hydroelectricity and infrastructure. For example, without electricity reserves it is not going to be possible for the DRC to have rapid development and economic diversification.</p><h4>In what direction would you like to see relations between the UAE and the DRC going?</h4><p>Until now relations have been good; however, we should reinforce them. I intend to advise our president to nominate an ambassador to come here in order to facilitate communication between the two states. The DRC suffers from a lack of air transportation companies. If flydubai could come to our country it would be supportive for our economy. The DRC is extremely large at 2,345,000 sqkm, and we need aircraft to transport both goods and passengers. The east of the country has many exchanges with Dubai, Kenya, and Uganda, but mostly with Dubai. We should reinforce our relations on the political and diplomatic level to push business interests to come to the DRC and take up the opportunities we have. We would also like to see an office of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce established in the DRC. The Dubai Chambers in Africa are all based in English-speaking African states. There are many French speaking countries in Africa that have exchanges with Dubai, including the DRC, Congo Brazzaville, Gabon, Cameroon, and Senegal. There are 26 countries that speak French and it would be good for the Dubai Chamber of Commerce to open an office in the DRC for the francophone nations in Africa. That would help push businesses to increase their activities in our region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-many-faces-of-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Markaz's focus today as a leading financial institution in the region?</h4><p>We manage investment products in the form of equities or real estate, monitoring opportunities emanating primarily from this region. We also invest for diversification purposes. On the investment banking side, we are active in capital markets, IT, and helping companies ease long-term funding needs in the form of equity, sukuk, or bonds. We believe in the importance of having a healthy asset management industry as a source of alternative funding because it helps intermediation. In this region, there is a high level of deposits, both institutional and private, and it is necessary to find opportunities to help deploy those deposits. The fund management and asset management industry is part of the mechanism that helps manage this objective. Our business model relies on two pillars, the first being investment returns out of our exposure on the stock market, investing hand-in-hand with our clients to ensure an alignment of interest; the objectives of the managers should match the objectives of the investors. The second pillar is investment fees; we generate fees that have to do with our efforts in terms of preparing opportunities, packaging them, researching them, managing them, and helping them fulfill their objectives. We are one of the top ten GCC mutual fund managers. The stock markets are important to us but, more importantly, they represent the underlying economies of the GCC.</p><h4>What trends are you seeing in GCC markets?</h4><p>The first trend I identify is the advent of strong regulation. This region, and especially Kuwait, is becoming one of the strongest in terms of regulation, which is very important for the investment banking and asset management industry. It is important that we conduct the best codes of corporate governance in not only the decisions we take, but also the quality of our decision-making. These are important at a time when there is so much political turmoil in the region. Regulation that ensures the adherence to good practices in terms of anti-money laundering and insuring that all the collective investment schemes are used to the purpose they are announced and nothing else is a very important thing. It is important that we hold people accountable for what they do, whether they are working in private or public entities, in terms of fulfilling the objectives of their institutions. The regulations we are seeing are part of a broader scheme of reforms that are extremely necessary in this region. The second major regional trend concerns the need to generate more jobs in the private sector as opposed to the public sector. The public sector is maxed out in terms of its capacity to absorb young graduates from universities and institutions. There is much debate revolving around how to generate more private-sector jobs and involve the private sector in high-profile projects; the financial services industry is going to be one of the key means to help empower and enlarge the private sector.</p><h4>What opportunities are you targeting for growth in the GCC and MENA region?</h4><p>This is a very vibrant, solvent region from a credit rating point of view. It has the capacity to embark on many interesting projects. No one single sector comes to mind as the foremost sector in this regard, but the housing sector is definitely going to be an interesting area for many investors, both institutional and private. The hydrocarbons sector, which has been under the control of the GCC for a long time, may, one day, open up to more opportunities for the private sector.</p><h4>What is your analysis of the impact low oil prices has had on Kuwait and regional economies?</h4><p>Falling oil prices prepare us for an interesting, more diversified economic era. It is an opportunity to bring out the best in Kuwait. Oil was undeniably crucial for the development of Kuwait and allowed the state to live in a regime of strong surpluses for a very long time, but it also led to inefficiencies. Sometimes it has created a sense of complacency, unfortunately, and I think oil prices going down will help eradicate that. It is an opportunity to look more seriously at the private sector's role in creating jobs.</p><h4>What role is Markaz playing in the effort to grow the private sector in Kuwait?</h4><p>Throughout the years, Markaz pioneered the development of investment tools in local and new markets. Markaz has succeeded year after year in developing new concepts and innovations through the creation of new investment channels, each with unique characteristics, in order to widen investors' horizons by diversify investment channels. And As part of our economic responsibility, we were the first to publish research with the aim of providing in-depth knowledge to the financial sector; in fact, a whole department was dedicated to research publication. Furthermore, Markaz cooperates with numerous academics and international research foundations to develop economic policy research in fields such as the energy sector, the labor market, economic structure, and the enhancement of the public institution performance to support a healthy private sector growth. Markaz distributes its public policy reports to decision makers and other stakeholders in Kuwait, and results are discussed with them to reach practical solutions.</p><h4>Markaz is known to be a socially engaged corporation. What is your approach to CSR?</h4><p>We believe in being strongly engaged in public welfare as a corporation, which led us to develop our own concept of CSR, which we call Corporate Economic Responsibility, where our engagement strategy focuses on contributing to three areas, namely: human development, ease of doing business, and good governance. We are active members of the Kuwaiti Economic Society, which is massively advocating a wide-scale reform of the public sector in terms of holding people accountable, assuring that when more areas of the economy are privatized, it is going to be a straightforward, transparent, and clean process.</p><h4>How would you rate Kuwait as an investment destination?</h4><p>Kuwait as an integrated part of the GCC network. We are in the business of equities, so if we liken Kuwait to a portfolio, Kuwait is a defensive stock because it has a limited downside. It is relatively transparent compared to other regions, where final decisions are important but the processes by which decisions are taken do not take a primary role. We stand tall in terms of the quality of decision-making, the transparency of the institution, and the robustness of its credit. In that respect, Kuwait is a more defensive play in the GCC region.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Because we are living in volatile times, especially this year, it is hard to have full clarity on a long-term vision. We aim to achieve a growth in our net earnings of at least 15% in 2015. One of the most pressing trends or reforms we need to have in the near future is to catch up with our neighbors and join the MSCI emerging market index. Kuwait is more than another frontier market and needs to be in the emerging market index. S&amp;P just added the UAE and Qatar, and Kuwait should be officially announced by our CMA as soon as possible. I do not see any reason why we are not there yet.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Gas Man Cometh]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-gas-man-cometh]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is Shell's current interest in Mozambique?</h4><p>Shell's interest in Mozambique is to develop a gas to liquids (GTL) project in the Cabo Delgado Province that intends to use natural gas from the Rovuma Basin to synthetically produce liquid fuel for the domestic and regional market. This project opportunity is being reviewed in partnership with the national oil company Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos (ENH) as part of the domestic gas vision created by the Mozambican government in 2014. We look forward to this potential project as it aims to diversify the future economy of Mozambique with the tremendous gas reserves of the Rovuma basin. </p><h4>What is GTL mainly used for?</h4><p>Gas to Liquids is a chemical transformation of natural gas to produce high quality chemical feedstock and liquid fuels, primarily gasoil and kerosene. Think of a GTL plant as a gas refinery.<br>It is a high purity product which can reduce local emissions, and can be used as is, without having to modify vehicle fuel tanks. For certain high end applications, such as the use of generators in confined spaces in the mining sector, customers need a low emission product and would use pure GTL gasoil. In most cases, GTL gasoil is blended with lower-grade diesel in order to create more finished product.  The potential GTL plant would also produce Naphtha as a feedstock for chemical plants and kerosene which can be used to fuel airplanes. </p><h4>What is the current status of Shell's feasibility study?</h4><p>Shell performed a preliminary feasibility study in 2014 that assessed different gas applications that Mozambique could consider to diversify its economy. The starting point was that Mozambique has so much gas that LNG alone cannot be the answer. Following discussions with Mozambican authorities and our partner ENH, and based on our global leadership in GTL, we signed a MoU for a full feasibility study for a potential GTL plant that would be located in the north of the country. We have now completed this feasibility study and concluded that it can be a technically and commercially viable project, assuming we can access enough gas on the right terms.</p><h4>What will Shell's contribution to the local economy be?</h4><p>This potential project forms part of the government's efforts to develop the domestic gas industry and to diversify the economy of Mozambique. The Mozambican economy of tomorrow is expected to have a huge LNG production capacity, and will therefore be extremely reliant on the international price of gas for its revenues. However, GTL could turn Mozambique from a net importer into a net exporter of oil products and end the current import dependence which consumes a substantial part of the national budget. A GTL plant would also have a major impact on the industrialisation of the country, as it would require more than 8,000 workers for construction and a further 800 workers to operate the facility effectively.  Some foreign workers are expected to be needed at the start but we would aim to maximize local jobs over time, as it makes sense for the country and for us as investors. We also look at Afungi GTL to create contract opportunities for local companies and we look at implementing some of the programmes we successfully implemented in other countries to support the creation and the development of small and medium enterprises. Finally, the project would obviously add significantly to the country GDP and revenues through tax and the government's equity in the project.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>We expect the Government of Mozambique to support the creation of the domestic industry and hope Afungi GTL to be selected as one of the priority projects to realise this vision. With this in place, our project would progress with site selection, as well as with further technical and commercial agreements that are needed before Front/End Engineering and Design contracts can be awarded. Finally, GTL and other potential domestic gas projects will depend on the progress in the upstream gas development, where other IOCs play a determining role. </p><h4>How do you envision the contribution of the energy sector to the local economy in the medium term?</h4><p>It could be substantial! Mozambique has a tremendous resource base in terms of hydroelectricity, coal, and gas. The latter has the opportunity to place Mozambique in a competitive position vis-í -vis other resource holders. It is important for Mozambique to diversify its economy to create a wider industry base, to get a stronger export position to its SADEC neighbours, and to improve its trade balance and access to foreign currency. Synergies exist between industrial projects. Our potential GTL project would for example generate extra electricity equivalent to the whole consumption of Cabo Delgado. </p><h4>What steps should be taken to ensure the fair distribution of wealth created by the energy sector?</h4><p>Distribution of wealth and revenues from the natural resources has historically been a major challenge for resource holders. Governments need to create the right environment to encourage diversification and local involvement, but investors also have a role to play. We will contribute by listening to the local population's expectations and through the application and the development of local skills and contractors, once the project would move forward to a final investment decision. As of today, the number of Mozambicans that are competitively skilled for the oil and gas sector is still limited, so we need to create and enhance technical educational institutions. Our ambition is to foster a diversified economy and we hope that our project can be one of the key enablers in making the vision of a domestic gas sector and a strongly developed Cabo Delgado region a reality. There is ample gas for LNG and for other projects to make a real impact on Mozambique's development.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-best-and-brightest]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the rapid development of the aviation sector regionally impacted Kuwait Airways, as one of the first local airlines established in the Gulf?</h4><p>Kuwait Airways was established in 1956 as a private company, and has since become a fully government-owned company. The Iraqi invasion destroyed the airline's infrastructure, as the aircraft and hangars were all either left or destroyed. We had to rebuild everything and start from scratch, and the airline's rebirth became a source of pride for Kuwait. Looking back at the history of the region, oil became the defining commodity in the GCC countries, and with the oil boom came a focus on new strategies by those GCC countries, very much around leisure and also aviation, which is a key platform in Qatar, for example. This all happened at the expense of Kuwait Airways. However, Kuwait Airways has always remained the favored and preferred airline of the Kuwaiti people.</p><h4>What has been your strategy to bring Kuwait Airways back to the leading market position it once held in Kuwait?</h4><p>When I became chairperson and managing director, my first priority was to sign contracts for new aircraft with either Airbus or Boeing. In line with that strategy, we are in the process of receiving 25 new aircraft from Airbus, 10 of them wide body and 15 of them narrow body, in addition to 12 leased aircraft. We also purchased 10 Boeing 777 aircraft. This was essential for us to be able to regain a share in what has become a competitive airline market in the GCC and the region overall. The Kuwaiti people fly all over the world, and we wanted to reclaim our place as their airline of choice so that they would prefer us to the likes of Qatar Airways, Emirates, or Etihad. We introduced our new fleet far faster than most airlines could, ensuring that customer experience is consistently outstanding. Our other priority was to achieve a financial transformation of the company so that it could be self-sufficient. We also wanted it to sustain and contribute to a cultural transformation, in the way people work and the way business is done in Kuwait. Having achieved those goals, we are now in a strong position to think about future structure and expansion. </p><h4>How were you able to streamline the workforce and ensure that your employees were also an efficient part of the company's transformation?</h4><p>According to the Kuwaiti privatization law, people can opt for either redundancy or early retirement. Some people were also transferred to government services. We ensured that the company was efficient from a company perspective, while at the same time recognizing the loyalty and service of people who had in many cases worked here for 15 years or longer. Nevertheless, we are still over-staffed, so the process of streamlining continues. One thing we take great pride in is that Kuwait Airways is truly a Kuwaiti company, in that it is run, managed, operated, maintained, and staffed by Kuwaitis, which distinguishes us significantly from other airlines in the region, including Qatar, Etihad, or Emirates. </p><h4>What is the plan to continue to deliver high quality services as well as more destinations to Kuwait Airways travel offerings?</h4><p>We have introduced eight new destinations in 2015 alone, including Munich, Vienna, Sharm El-Sheikh, Bangalore, and Medina. The new aircraft we acquired will enable us to fly to destinations that were not within our reach before, so we will eventually fly to potential destinations such as Los Angeles, Toronto, Boston, and Guanzhou. It is not just about flying to more places, it's also about offering more frequencies, which gives people the convenience they want. We have combined that with operational reliability, quality products and service onboard the aircraft, and a Kuwaiti touch.</p><h4>What new opportunities are you targeting for the future of Kuwait Airways?</h4><p>We are now focusing on our new terminal, and we have finally received approval from the Supreme Council to continue with the new terminal. Our aircraft and services are under our control, though the airport is not. Airport services are just as big a factor for our business as aircraft because it directly affects our flow of passengers.</p><h4>You collaborate with Red Crescent to provide humanitarian aid to those in need. How important are these kinds of initiatives for the company?</h4><p>We help Red Crescent with cargo flights. We recently provided two relief flights to Syria, where we provided relief equipment and supplies for Red Crescent. Not everything is business, and we have a certain responsibility in the markets we serve. We have been proud to serve Syria in the last few years, and we want to keep serving and helping them in this time of need. The same is true for Yemen. We see this as a part of our corporate responsibility.</p><h4>What do you expect will be the most important factor in making Kuwait Airways a top airline in the Gulf region?</h4><p>The airport is the most important factor. It does not matter how many aircraft you have if you do not have the facilities to operate them and cater to the increased flows. Kuwait has much more competition, partially due to the fact that people see Kuwait as being a more attractive market in itself. Qatar and Emirates are about providing connectivity, but it is a different situation in Kuwait. Carriers come to Kuwait to take the business of Kuwait.</p><h4>As the national flagship carrier of Kuwait, what vision you would like to see achieved at Kuwait Airways moving forward?</h4><p>The world first gets to know about your country through your airline, so it is an important part of any country's economy. We want to become a boutique airline that is growing healthily, serving Kuwaitis and those who live in Kuwait. We want to provide a service that gets them where they want to go at the frequencies and with the quality of service that they desire, and we want them to prefer us simply for the pleasure of flying Kuwait Airways.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016, and what are your priorities for next year?</h4><p>We are working on our new identity and rebranding Kuwait Airways in accordance with our new strategies. By June 2016, customers will see a new Kuwait Airways.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[All Along the Value Chain]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[all-along-the-value-chain]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You acquired a majority stake in Forte Oil in 2007. How has your vision for growth evolved since then?</h4><p>The vision was to turn the then African Petroleum around and build a world-class business. We saw a huge opportunity to build an efficient chain of retail outlets that would surpass the expectations of shareholders. We achieved that and went on to expand the vision to become the foremost integrated energy solutions provider. Today we own assets across various aspects of the energy chain and are poised to invest in further expansion and asset acquisition to solidify our position. We no longer see ourselves as just a local business; we now operate from a global perspective.</p><h4>Forte has just received an investment of $200 million from Mercuria Group in exchange for a 17% stake. How has this deal changed Forte's strategy going forward?</h4><p>Our five-year strategic business outlook, which commenced in 2015, makes mention of a number of key focus areas. We said we would strengthen our balance sheet and optimize our working capital mix amongst other things. We also stated that we would aggressively pursue M&amp;A opportunities along the energy value chain. This deal with Mercuria fulfills some of these aspirations. This is not so much of a change in strategic direction, but rather a fulfillment of a major anchor point of our strategic plan. We have had a long-term trading relationship with Mercuria, but this investment now deepens opportunities for us to derive full benefits of backward integration along the value chain.</p><h4>How has the current economic situation affected your business?</h4><p>Our business model is built on the foundations of resilience and our ability to adapt to changes in our operating environment. The significant dip in oil prices and its spiral effects on the Nigerian economy and our business were taken into account for our forecast for the year. Current oil prices have adversely affected the national income and consequently fuels consumption on the retail segment of our business. Our upstream services business has also been negatively impacted as the E&amp;P companies have had to re-negotiated contracts in view of the falling oil prices. However, diversification into the power generation business and our focus on high-margin products, such as lubricants and LPG, have allowed us to absorb these shocks, which I believe are temporary. The new government is doing all it can to create a stable business environment that will improve the overall macro-economic conditions in Nigeria.  </p><h4>How did you achieve the rebound in performance after the 2009 economic crisis?</h4><p>I was running a very robust business and controlled a very large share of the diesel market in Nigeria. The business had grown beyond my imagination but I failed to recognize the importance of putting a robust risk management structure in its day-to-day operations, so when the 2008 meltdown occurred, the business suffered heavily from the devaluation of the naira and the capital market collapse. Having learned from this experience, I rebuilt my business with world-class professionals and I only play an advisory and mentoring role, and this is evident in the performance and strong results being posted today.</p><h4>Forte acquired the Geregu Power Plant during the power sector privatization and has recently signed an agreement with Siemens to overhaul it. What role do you envision power sector projects playing in Forte Oil's mix of assets in the future?</h4><p>We have always stressed that our goal was to diversify our revenue base and we achieved this via the strategic acquisition of the Geregu Power Plant. Power sector projects will continue be center stage of our growth aspirations. Going forward, we expect to see the power business contribute significantly to our corporate basket. Our expectation is that as the government continues to provide the right enabling environment particularly in terms of necessary improvements to the existing regulatory and operational frameworks, our strategic asset will deliver even more value to the shareholders. In addition, as more Nigerians set up SMEs and our local industries step up their production as a result of improved power supply, we foresee a growth in the demand for power required to meet their operational needs. The major overhaul places us in a good stead to meet the ramped up demand.</p><h4>As Nigeria's economy grows and per-capita GDP rises with it, what are the growth prospects in your downstream distribution business?</h4><p>Ours is a youthful population with rising demand for consumable products. Our passion is to keep driving lives by providing uncommon service solutions to all Nigerians. As we expand our retail footprints and continue to provide convenient and affordable services, the response from Nigerians has been positive. Growth opportunities for fuels and lubricants lie in our growing population, and in rising demand for distribution from the manufacturing sector in the near future stemming from increased power supply. We also expect increased demand for cooking gas as Nigerians are now making the switch to the LPG. We are also developing and providing convenient payment solutions such as the FO Advantage card to our growing middle class. We are building partnerships with reputable brands to increase traffic to our stations.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>I believe despite the economic that upheavals we are experiencing at the moment, the Nigerian economy is still resilient and will stand the test of time. For the oil and gas sector, I see increased participation of indigenous firms as a result of their continuous efforts in building capacity and solid business structures. Our downstream business will continue to seek more opportunities in view of the growth in the Nigerian population. We shall also continue to seek additional opportunities to diversify our revenue streams along the energy value chain.</p>]]></richbody0content>

With a subsidiary based in London, there are many international people working for Visor Capital who conduct major deals and transactions for the company. However, we are in the process of shutting down Visor Capital because we consider investment banking in Kazakhstan to show little potential. We are minimizing the staff and the business step by step, as Kazakhstan's economy is not big enough to support these kinds of operations.</p><h4>What sectors are showing the most potential?</h4><p>The main principle that we adhere to is that we never go into an unknown country with an unknown business. You can go to an unknown country with a business you know or to a known country with a business that you do not know. We are not particular in terms of the sectors we are interested in. Our focus of late has been telecoms. We have created the largest telecoms firm operating from greenfield. About four years ago we sold the majority stake in this business to a company in Sweden, but we are still minority shareholders. It is a big business and it has a lot of clients. We also own one of the largest telecoms operations in the Kyrgyz Republic as well, called O. We have been the first to introduce LTE services in the country. We have a good team there and it is a good business. The Kyrgyz Republic just joined the customs union and there are a lot of Kyrgyz people living in customs union countries, so we are optimistic about this business. We will be in business for the medium-term as long as nothing major happens.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in this region?</h4><p>The problem of Kazakhstan is the so-called Dutch disease. All the assets here are expensive. From the point of view of an investor, it is not exciting. Our business model has been to use local funding, money from the Kazakhstani banks, buying assets in a country with cheaper assets but high risks and high opportunity. Kazakhstan has made huge progress and it has a good investment climate, but the other part of the story is that the assets are expensive. Investing in countries like Uzbekistan can be a challenge for the staff. For example, the Uzbek government confiscated one of our cement plants about four years ago. It has made tax allegations and makes it unreasonably expensive, which is why we had to exit this business. We launched a complaint two years ago and it will take another two years, but we are confident that we are going to win. We are one of the largest investors in Kyrgyzstan and there have been two revolutions there. One of our businesses there is a retail business. Every time there is a revolution there are some looters and the first place they go are the supermarkets, so we lose all the working capital we have.</p><h4>Are you seeing these challenges as opportunities?</h4><p>We plan to sell some assets in Nepal, sit on the cash for the next two years, and look for fresh opportunities. Solid buying opportunities will come, because the current situation lacks stability, as the banking system is deteriorating, the Central Bank is making poor decisions, and oil prices are low. Conversely, Kazakhstan has another positive booster that can help. In a year or two, Kashagan is coming. Even though it has experienced significant delays, once it happens it will bring additional revenues and increase confidence.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the company moving forward?</h4><p>We will continue watching Kazakhstan carefully. Kazakhstan is on the eve of an unprecedented political transformation, and this obviously makes people and the business community nervous. Neighboring countries are experiencing hard times both politically and economically, which is why people want to sell. At some point, Kazakhstan will experience this, and it will be a great time to buy. We want to watch Kazakhstan and watch what happens with the Kazakhstani banks and international companies doing business here. When a large international company leaves Kazakhstan, it presents a huge opportunity for a local one. We are optimistic about Kyrgyzstan, as it held its first democratic elections in late September and successfully held elections with six different parties holding seats in parliament. We expect something to happen in Uzbekistan, as it has the same problem with the transit of power. It's a huge country with a population of 30 million people, which is almost twice as big as Kazakhstan. It has a large population growth rate, and many natural resources such as gas, gold, cotton, and uranium, and has managed to develop many businesses inside the country. The real problem of Uzbekistan is economic mismanagement, as its currency exchange regime if volatile. Uzbekistan will change at some point and will become a leader in the region. Some people in Kazakhstan consider Uzbekistan a competitor, but if it is an open country with an open economy, it is going to be a boost for Kazakhstan as well. It will be healthy competition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the market factors that led to the establishment of Confervio Agregados in Colombia?</h4><p>The political, economic, and security situation in Venezuela pushed us into Colombia, where we set up Confervio Agregados. Additionally, we have to keep in mind that security levels in Venezuela are far from optimum. Colombia was and is a booming economy in which the oil sector has yet to reach its full potential. We see the opportunity to transfer all our knowledge and experience in this sector into Colombia. Arriving in this country and starting from scratch was a big challenge because the cultural and sector difference are palpable. In fact, Venezuela's oil reserves are larger than Colombia's. However, it was a great learning experience and pushed us to diversify our business portfolio, targeting other industries such as cement.</p><h4>What industries offer the highest potential for Confervio Aregados?</h4><p>The food and beverage and the cement industries are our two top priorities right now and we put a lot of effort into entering and consolidating our activity there. In fact, we manage concrete production plants in Venezuela and we aim to do the same in Colombia. We currently have two offices, in Bogotá and Cartagena. We will be opening a new office in Villavicencio and Barrancabermeja. This move is aimed at allowing us to participate in two key projects, the expansion of the Barrancabermeja refinery and the construction of the Meta refinery. We have the aim to introduce and consolidate the JC valves and the high-pressure cylinders we commercialize through these projects. In this context, we have certified all our products and represented products in Colombia, something that has been a challenge in itself due to the fact that if you do not provide certified products, you are not competitive in this market. Our products have already been purchased for key projects such as Reficar in Cartagena. We have managed to pick up a lot of projects so far despite being in Colombia for a short period of time; last year alone we took part in 80 projects between Ecopetrol and refineries.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind your success?</h4><p>Our experience in the oil industry has been one of the key elements in our success. Also, despite the large number of players in the sector, there are segments in it in which there is still not much of an offering, such as valves. In this context, we have been competitive with delivery dates. Our quality and certified products have also contributed to our rapid expansion. It is also increasingly in demand for suppliers to have certified processes. Confervio got its processes certified last year. Our success and consolidation will most likely be based on companies considering our products for their engineering projects.</p><h4>What are the main differences in doing business in Colombia and in Venezuela?</h4><p>Legal security levels in Colombia are much higher; Colombia has reached high levels of finance and legal security thanks to the strengthening of its finance and banking systems. For example, there is more certainty to get your invoices paid within the terms agreed in Colombia. The bureaucratic burdens or steps toward registering businesses are faster and much more organized in Colombia as well.</p><h4>How has the devaluation of the peso affected the company?</h4><p>It has had an impact on our business. We import products from China, the EU, and the US. Consequently, the depreciation has generated unexpected extra costs. However, we must be steadfast and continue with our business consolidation. This is our main business objective along with the diversification of our products and customers. With time, we believe we could be producing high-technology products in Colombia, something few companies do in the industry.</p><h4>What are some of the other competitive advantages of Colombia?</h4><p>Having access to the sea is a competitive advantage for any country. Both Colombia and Venezuela, for example, have access to the Caribbean Sea. However, Colombia also has access to the Pacific Ocean. This means access to the East and West coasts of the US, Caribbean countries, Europe, China, and the rest of Asia. In Colombia, import and customs clearance procedures are also much faster and organized than in other neighboring countries.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the oil industry in Colombia for 2015-16?</h4><p>The recovery of oil prices will not happen in the short term. However, now is the time to expand the activity of the refineries to create added value. Companies operating in the sector need to rethink the way that we do business and probably diversify the business portfolio. In this case, exports are a great opportunity.</p><h4>Where do you see Confervio in five years time?</h4><p>I think by 2018-20, Confervio will have an established and high level of reliability for high-technology equipment and products. It is unlikely that we will have local production in this time frame. However, we aim to become a reliable supplier and partner for our customers. We also want to expand our business portfolio with project management for companies, for example.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the diplomatic relationship between Panama and Peru?</h4><p>Panama and Peru have a strong bilateral relationship, built on long-standing historical ties as well current complementarities between both economies. As a key services provider, Panama complements Peru's prowess as a major exporter of commodities and light manufacturing and importer of value-added goods. In fiscal year 2015, over 19 million tons of goods transited the Panama Canal on their way to or from Peruvian ports, making the country the Canal's fifth-largest user. A free-trade accord between both countries has been in effect since 2012, bolstered by other agreements regarding air-services and suppression of tourist and business visas. In July 2014, the Panama-Peru Chamber of Commerce was set up and now encompasses 24 members. Beyond commerce, both countries cooperate extensively on several fronts, including agriculture, measures against drug trafficking, and security.</p><h4>What sectors of Peru's economy are appealing for Panamanian companies and what advantages does Peru offer Panamanian investors?</h4><p>Food and industrial processing are the most appealing to Panamanian companies due to Panama's exports towards Peru, mainly animal and vegetable oils. Beyond these, there are other primary products that can be processed in the Peruvian manufacturing sector. In another crucial area, Peru's consistently strong performance, leading to an investment-grade status, makes the country an attractive magnet for investment in financial services.</p><h4>What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Maritime services, including ship repair and other logistics services related to Peruvian vessels, is one potential area for growth, especially in light of the Panama Canal expansion. Tourism is another area to continue exploring, not just bilaterally. Panama's air connectivity means a greater influx of tourists from Europe, North America, and the Middle East, potentially destined for other countries in the region, including Peru.</p><h4>What will be the focus of bilateral relations over the medium term?</h4><p>Possible joint efforts to foster market integration through greater economies of scale will be the focus. There is much potential in deepening cooperation in sectors such as mining, agriculture, and light industry.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE was one of the first countries to establish a permanent embassy in Somalia. How would you assess the UAE's support for Somalia's stability?</h4><p>Somalia emerged from two decades of civil war and instability when the current government was democratically selected in 2012. My government faced the double challenge of needing to rebuild a country with no government or service institutions in place, whilst fighting a terrorist group. In three years, Somalia has managed to regain control of 80% of its territory, establish basic, but functioning government ministries, open schools and hospitals, re-establish trade links with various countries, set up a working Central Bank with transparent financial functions, and start to build back up critical pieces of infrastructure, like roads and ports. There is a long shared history between Somalia and the UAE; we have always traded and have shared interests in the stability of the Arab-African relationship. The UAE was one of the first major supporters of Somalia. The UAE saw the opportunity inherent in establishing a strong relationship with Somalia, initially responding to key humanitarian and development needs in an environment, which other donors saw as too risky. We salute the courage and humanity of the UAE governments in doing so. Since then, the UAE has provided a broad range of support to Somalia—but always on-ground, practical, and tangible initiatives that Somalis feel and see. The UAE has provided extensive military and security support through training Somali soldiers and providing a military training academy. It has supported the resumption of public services, in particular in the health sector, opening hospitals and health centers. It has reached out to Somalis in need of the very basics, building wells where terrorists had destroyed them and allowing families to access water for their children and their livestock. Dubai Ports has indicated significant interest in helping to establish three potential ports on the Somali coast. The UAE has been a significant force in the fight against piracy in Somali waters, with great success. Earlier this year, a UAE convoy was ambushed by al-Shabaab, but in testament to the UAE's bravery and friendship, it has not been deterred from continuing to support the future peace and prosperity of Somalia.</p><h4>In June 2015, Your Excellency presided over the opening of the UAE Hospital in Mogadishu. How is the UAE helping to develop Somalia's health sector?</h4><p>Yes, the first phase of the Sheikh Zayed Hospital was opened in May this year in Mogadishu. It will treat 300 patients, who will receive free medical care, and has specialized sections for day surgery and radiology. The second phase will see the hospital expanded with to a 200-bed capacity, with major surgery rooms and other specializations. It is equipped to the highest standards and will provide excellent medical services to Somalis.</p><h4>Oil represents just 2% of Dubai's GDP, with the bulk of the economy comprised of tourism, retail, real estate, trade and logistics, and manufacturing. In what other areas could Dubai's expertise be of value for Somalia?</h4><p>The UAE has set an extraordinary example of what can be achieved when a country combines visionary leadership, wise stewardship, and investment of its resources, and insists on a quality approach to all it does. Standing on the balcony at a hotel in Dubai recently and gazing over the expanse of a city that basically was not there 25 years ago is the best energizer anyone could wish for. Economic recovery and empowerment is the key issue for Somalia—not just in order to be able to finance our own development and future, but also because ensuring that people have access to meaningful work and get paid to do that work is the best investment a country can make in its security and stability. The UAE took a finite resource and turned it into something of infinite value. Somalia is blessed with a huge store of natural resources, from oil and gas to fisheries and livestock. We have the longest coastline in Africa, two rivers, and extensive agricultural land. We have excellent human potential: a very young, entrepreneurial population, and a highly educated and returning diaspora. When you combine our human resources with the natural resource potential of Somalia, I think there are unlimited possibilities ahead of us as a nation. So, apart from technical support in areas where the UAE has significant expertise, key for Somalia will also be learning from the UAE about rapid, self-managed, and self-funded economic development that suits the Somali context.</p><h4>How do you see Somalia-UAE bilateral relations developing in the next decade?</h4><p>The two countries enjoy a frank and full dialogue, and I am sure this will ensure that our friendship continues to grow. Insha'Allah, our strategic relationship will also become more balanced as Somalia continues to develop. I would hope that there will be less “take" in the relationship and more “give" from Somalia, not just in terms of trade and export, but also in shouldering regional responsibilities such as working to end extremism and positively contributing to the economic stability of the region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[lets-do-this-together]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the primary objectives of Kuwait Energy and how would you describe its investment strategy in the region?</h4><p>Kuwait Energy aims to become the pre-eminent Middle East-based independent oil and gas company and to develop and manage oil and gas assets in the interest of our stakeholders. Our strategy is simple, that is to leverage our technical expertise, local knowledge, and solid relationships to enhance our operations in the region and always ensure that we have a win-win relationship with host governments. When it comes to operations, we actively manage and operate our assets while prudently managing financial risk through a conservative capital structure. Our knowledge of the Middle East, and operational experience in the region, enable us to have an advantage in terms of operational planning, project execution, and risk management.</p><h4>What are some of Kuwait Energy's major ongoing oil and gas projects in the MENA region and how do they align with the development goals of the countries' economies?</h4><p>Due to the upstream industry's nature, Kuwait Energy contributes to the development of a country's economy in three major ways: it injects investment that vitalizes local markets and industries, produces hydrocarbons to support the host governments economies', and employs local staff to support employment. For example, in Egypt, Kuwait Energy and its JV partner's investments result in a gross production figure of circa 38,600 BOEPD and the employment of over 400 employees. Kuwait Energy is the operator of three out of the four producing assets (East Ras Qattara, Abu Sennan, Area A, and Burj El Arab). Kuwait Energy's projects are aligned with the development goals of the countries we work in. A recent example is the Abu Sennan gas plant in Egypt, which is the result of the strong partnership between EGPC and Kuwait Energy and a successful example of the public sector and the private sector coming together and each sector bringing in its share of knowledge, skills, and strengths for the interest of the country. The plant allows for optimum utilization of the hydrocarbons in Abu Sennan's Area. The associated gas is now captured and processed for domestic utilization instead of being flared into the environment. The process has also removed a bottleneck in oil production resulting in an increase in total field output. In Iraq, we've invested more than $300 million in the past five years, just commenced production from Block-9, and achieved 96% Iraqization in our office staffing. Within the coming year, we plan to commence production from the Siba gas field, the first gas field development in Iraq, which will provide much-needed natural gas to the national grid for domestic requirements. In Iraq, we enjoy a position of currently being one of the few regional independent oil and gas companies to be present in Southern Iraq, with our two major projects, the Siba gas field and the Block 9 oil field. While the Siba gas facility is being constructed and close to operation, we began production from Block 9 from Faihaa-1 well in October 2015. This first production from Block 9 was achieved after one year from the first discovery made in the Block. In addition, Iraq aims to greatly increase its crude oil production in both the short term and the long term to become one of the largest if not the largest oil producer by 2020. With a substantial year-end 2014 audited 2P reserves number of 725mmboe for Block 9, we are working toward fast tracking the complete development of the Block taking it into full production. As Iraq aims to substantially increase oil production and export in the medium and long term, we are confident of our ability to become one of the major contributors to the country's oil production targets. With regards to Yemen, a similar approach is followed, and millions of investment dollars are utilized to produce oil and gas to support the Yemeni economy. We also achieved very high Yemenization employment rates, similar to the ones we are achieving in Egypt and Iraq.</p><h4>Tell us about the unique access Kuwait Energy has through its strong relations with national oil and gas companies and local governments in the region.</h4><p>We provide valuable technical expertise, advice, and assistance to the national oil and gas companies and local governments on oil and gas projects that are important to these countries' economic development in the region. In Yemen, we have been working closely with the Yemen Ministry of Oil and Minerals, studying the potential development of natural gas reserves in Yemen and the optimization of the country's natural gas resources for the benefit of its people and to develop a long-term Yemen Gas Master Plan. We advise the Ministry on the most suitable uses and applications for the country's gas resources in order to ensure production sustainability and maximize revenue generation and job creation. As for Egypt, we acted as the catalyst behind the recent agreement with the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), from which it gained a 10% participating interest in Block 9, Iraq. This is EGPC's first international investment and contributed to building an economic relationship between Iraq and Egypt. We go beyond business and operations when it comes to our relationships with local governments, and become their support in difficult times. For example in Egypt, during the revolution in 2011, we were more understanding of the country's tough financial circumstances, and ensured that we support the country during those tough times. This was received very favorably by the EGPC as we proved that one of our main goals as a company is to become true partners and in the economic development of the countries we work in. In Iraq, we support the local government by providing relief aid to the internally displaced people (IDP) that have moved to the Basra region. Last December, we provided complete relief aid to the IDPs in Basra and, last Ramadan, we provided food packages to 2,500 families.</p><h4>What importance do you place on attracting, retaining, and developing human capital, knowledge, and technical expertise?</h4><p>We genuinely believe our people are our most important asset and we are deeply committed to their on-going development in order to deliver technical and operational excellence. Toward the end of 2014, we adopted a change in our organizational structure that would support our business growth plans, especially our large-scale projects in Iraq. This year we adopted a company-wide coaching program that will help all of our human capital develop and cope with our business and operational growth.</p><h4>What are some of Kuwait Energy's most prominent CSR activities in Kuwait and abroad?</h4><p>We believe strongly that we are part of every community in which we work. We have a duty to enrich lives in the diverse areas where we operate, beyond the employment and other commercial opportunities we create. Our continuous support for youth development programs and the provision of school supplies to children, recently in Egypt and Iraq, stems from our belief in promoting learning and education to work toward more sustained economies and healthy societies. We respond to emergency needs in the areas we work in. Recently, we have been providing relief aid with food and fresh water, medicine, and shelter to deprived families in Iraq and in Yemen. We strongly believe in supporting and providing opportunities to enable and empower women. In Egypt, we supported a project to enhance the quality of life for illiterate women through awareness and educational sessions. By teaching the women a range of basic skills to improve their confidence and positively impact their families and personal life, the initiative can help reduce the possibility of failed marriages and divorce. In Iraq, we sponsored sewing workshops for 30 underprivileged women in the Siba area, aimed at empowering women and providing them with skills they can use to start their own small home sewing businesses. We invited female petroleum engineering students from the Technology University in Baghdad to attend an intensive, two-week internship program at our office in Kuwait. We believe in the importance of providing women equal opportunities to develop in any business sector. Environmentally, we continuously upgrade our safety procedures in line with the highest safety standards. In Iraq's Siba and Block 9 fields, we completed environmental impact studies allowing us to develop projects that are socially and environmentally sustainable. With regards to health, safety, and environment, we follow world-standard environmental procedures, and our HSSE record is very competitive amongst our peers. In Kuwait, we planted the first tree of the Kuwait Green Wall project in June 5, 2012. The project aims to plant 315,000 trees in a circuit that stretches the entire land border of Kuwait. Following that, we went back in 2013 to plant 500 trees. Led by Kuwait Oasis, trees indigenous to the region are planted and provided with water conserved via specially designed utility boxes. Two years into the Green Oasis project, 90% of the trees we planted have grown and become fully independent. The irrigation system has been removed and the trees are able to survive on their own. Encouraging traces of natural life can now be seen surrounding the trees. This is positive sign meaning that the project is environmentally sustainability.</p><h4>What emerging growth opportunities do you see for oil and gas development in the MENA region?</h4><p>Currently, we have large-scale projects in Iraq, the Siba gas project, and Block 9 located in Southern Iraq. In accordance with our plans, we are allocating great effort and finances to fast-track the projects and bring them to existing infrastructure to ramp up and accelerate our production in Iraq in the near term. Once we bring more production on stream, the time will be right to go and target our next growth opportunity to create further value to stakeholders.</p><h4>Kuwait Energy's long-term vision is to be a partner in development of oil and gas projects throughout the region. What are the plans to continue building on Kuwait Energy's track record moving forward?</h4><p>A key partner for Kuwait Energy is host governments. When we enter a country, we enter with the goal to remain for the long term. To achieve this we believe we first need to understand the country's needs — economically and even socially. We then plan our business and operations in the country based on those needs. This helps us establish and maintain an excellent track record as they witness and experience our true desire to become long term partners, not only in the development of the country's oil and gas projects, but also the development of the country's people for a more sustainable economic and social development.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Kuwait Energy in 2016?</h4><p>We continue focusing our efforts on large projects in Iraq, eyeing the production start-up of the Siba gas project and fast tracking the full field development of Block 9. In addition, we will continue our operations in Egypt while carefully monitoring oil price movements and adjusting our work plans and capital expenditure accordingly to invest strategically across our assets.  Kuwait Energy will continue to monitor the security and political situation in Yemen to enable us to restart production when the situation allows us to in a safe and secure manner.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main objectives that the KLRCA has set out to achieve?</h4><p>The KLRCA was established in 1978 by the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) with the objective of becoming the regional arbitration center of choice for South East Asia in general, and Malaysia specifically. As such, the KLRCA was tasked with the duties of administering arbitration proceedings, both domestic and international in character, along with many other tasks relating to the dissemination of knowledge on alternative dispute resolution (ADR) and arbitration, promoting the use of ADRs domestically and internationally, and the training in arbitration of legal practitioners, judges, and other stakeholders, amongst others. The most important function of the KLRCA, and which forms its core function today, is however, the administration of arbitration proceedings. To this end, the KLRCA has its own set of procedural rules, called the KLRCA Arbitration Rules, the latest version of which debuted in October 2013. The KLRCA Arbitration Rules, as a whole, govern the conduct of the entire arbitration proceedings, from commencement to termination, whether by way of delivery of a final award from the Arbitral Tribunal or otherwise.</p><h4>What is the role of arbitration in Islamic finance?</h4><p>Malaysia is currently one of the leading global hubs for Islamic finance and continues to grow rapidly with a highly conducive international business environment, efficient regulatory and supervisory legal framework, and active secondary sukuk market. More jurisdictions are expected to penetrate into the Islamic financial industry. This in turn has created a diverse and growing community of local and international financial institutions with an increasing number of commercial transactions based on sharia principles. The KLRCA has come out with the KLRCA i-Arbitration Rules, which allows for the resolution of disputes arising from any contract that contains sharia issues. The aim behind the Rules is to provide arbitration that is suitable for international commercial transactions premised on Islamic principles, the Rules for which will be recognized and enforced internationally. This is an important move for Islamic finance, because it will provide a process for dispute resolution that incorporates a process for deciding differences of opinion between parties on the sharia compliance of contractual arrangements.</p><h4>How can KLRCA contribute to the country's goal of becoming a developed nation by 2020?</h4><p>The regionalization and globalization of elevated investment, trade, and commerce in and from Asia has contributed favorably toward the growth of the Malaysian economy. A significant number of contracts exchange hands when local and foreign investments come in. More companies and institutions alike are turning to arbitration in particular to resolve disputes peacefully and amicably. To safeguard their interests and investments when a dispute arises, these parties more often than not include an arbitration clause in their contracts. KLRCA's international recognition of administering arbitration proceedings, both domestic and international, provides an impartial platform for these parties to do just that. A key selling point of arbitration is the international enforceability of its awards. The reason for this is that, it is usually much easier to enforce a foreign arbitral award than a foreign court judgment. While enforcement of foreign court judgment requires reciprocity agreement between the states, enforcement of the foreign arbitral award can be made on the basis of the New York Convention, to which Malaysia is a signatory. More than 150 states are members of this Convention as of today. This legal instrument offers a relatively simple and unified procedure for enforcement of any arbitral award. KLRCA's vast experience in international arbitration matters gives confidence to local and foreign entities entering into contracts and carrying out transactions in Malaysia. When contracts are honored, businesses progress and the country's economy grows. When a dispute arises, arbitration is in place to resolve the issue, hence ensuring the continuity of businesses. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sepang International Circuit was established in 1999. How has it developed since then?</h4><p>Sepang was built primarily for Formula 1. At the time, our Prime Minister saw Formula 1 as a means of promoting Malaysia as a global destination. In 1999, nobody really knew what Malaysia had to offer and we would often be confused with Singapore. Although there has been a history of motorsports in Malaysia, it was not as popular then as it is today. Motorsports are still the primary sport at the Sepang Circuit; however, we have evolved as a multifaceted venue and promote ourselves for any corporate event with or without the involvement of motorsports. There is an element of motorsports and extreme activities purely because of the space that we have available. We have been able to do that successfully, and at the same time we are healthy and self-sustaining.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the upcoming Formula 1 Petronas Grand Prix?</h4><p>Formula 1 is still rated as the third most watched sporting event in the world, behind the World Cup and the Olympics. It is facing certain challenges today, yet it retains its relevance considering the investment that the country has made over the past 17 years. We are facing some difficulty in terms of attracting local spectators. Many are looking for something different after 17 years. We are challenged by would-be spectators opting for remote viewing on digital platforms from the comfort of their own homes. However, there are still many who have yet to visit Sepang Circuit and we are devising appealing ways of attracting them. We began to host concerts in 2009 to attract people. The danger now is that people will only come to the circuit depending on what musical artist comes in. Still, we have been able to create side activities at the event. In 2015, we provided a number of motorsports experiences. We try differentiating ourselves from other circuits, and ticket holders also enjoy go-karting, rally, gymkhana, and 4x4 rides around an actual racecourse. In addition, we are also promoting the venue as family friendly because there was considerable negativity over the noise level of Formula 1. It has been quieter this past year, due to changes to engines, which was actually not welcomed by some fans who liked the old noise level, but it was good for families with children. </p><h4>How does the Sepang Circuit encourage grassroots motorsports and cultivate local talent?</h4><p>There is a fine balance between encouraging grassroots development and maintaining the circuit at the peak level stipulated by authorities such as the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). Therefore, we cannot allow grassroots motorsports too much time on the track, or else we have to charge for upkeep. We are an entity of the Ministry of Finance (MoF), and an agenda for the MoF is to contribute to nation building. We do this through programs that contribute to the success of the nation with events like MotoGP. We have been placing local talent in categories for the MotoGP, which is a worldwide event. In March 2015, we launched our own MotoGP team for the first time. We want to make sure that there is a platform for our young riders to perform in world championships. As long as the program complements our events, the case is there. It is expensive to sponsor these young riders, and we do the best we can. </p><h4>What do you expect for the future of Malaysian sports?</h4><p>Malaysians are passionate about their sports; however, infrastructure is lacking, and there are no systematic programs or training available, which is why we need increased corporate sponsorship. We have a number of promising athletes in squash, two-wheel motor sports, and synchronized diving, for example. Unfortunately, a sport that we love, football, is one we lack strength in. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You recently organized an event on the One Belt, One Road Initiative. What is the importance of this initiative for bilateral relations between China and Malaysia?</h4><p>One Belt, One Road is important, not only in terms of bilateral relations between China and Malaysia, but also regionally. The ASEAN Summit has adopted a master plan on connectivity, which spells out the various plans that ASEAN needs to focus on in terms of air, rail, road, and sea transport. The China initiative of the Maritime Silk Road helps us to achieve the connectivity master plan. </p><h4>What conclusions were drawn from your recent 19th Malaysian Banking Summit entitled “Banking in a New Regional Landscape with ASEAN Economic Integration" and, how will the upcoming ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) impact the banking sector?</h4><p>Our Banking Summit is an annual conference organized to bring together the leading bankers in the country to look at the state of banking in Malaysia as well as the challenges and opportunities facing the sector. In 2015, the banking sector has to address a number of issues. The economy has a number of challenges, and there is a need for the banking sector to continue to be able to support what the business community needs in terms of financing and loans. At the same time, the AEC will require the region to come up with a regional financial architecture that will allow banks in different countries to be able to move freely as established branches and operations in the other Asian countries. </p><h4>Why was the Center for Public Policy Studies (CPPS) established by ASLI?</h4><p>The main purpose for the Center is to have an independent approach to public policy studies, and we have an extensive engagement with the business community, as well as with NGOs, to identify their areas of concern in terms of public policy, based upon which we develop our research, and make submissions and proposals to the government on a wide range of key issues. We look at a number of challenges, including inclusive development, human rights, sustainable growth, as well as education and human capital development. </p><h4>Inclusive development is one of the research focuses of the CPPS. What can be done to ensure the benefits of Vision 2020 are enjoyed by all members of society?</h4><p>By 2020, the government envisions Malaysia to be a fully developed nation, and what is important is that there has to be equitable distribution to be able to reduce inequalities and to be able to look at the problems of poverty and how we can reduce that at rural and urban levels. The emphasis on inclusive development will help promote a more equitable society. </p><h4>What are your key objectives for ASLI?</h4><p>We will continue to look at a number of conferences that we provide, and conduct extensive research on topics such as gender issues and the participation of women. We also want to look further at Asian integration, and what has been achieved after the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in 2015. Every year, we organize an important ASEAN Leadership Forum in April. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sloan has other Schools in its network, but all of them with partners or preexisting schools. What are some of the challenges and advantages of starting from scratch?</h4><p>The ability to be innovative in curriculum design can be enhanced when there is no preexisting legacy to contend with.  MIT's motto “Mens et Manus“ (mind and hand)communicates a commitment to integrating theory and practice, creating a deep connection between what goes on inside the classroom and what goes on outside of it, for example, in the “real world.“  Over the past three decades, MIT Sloan School has refined the application of the mind-and-hand motto into its “action learning“ curriculum.  Consistent with a philosophy of innovation and entrepreneurship, dozens of action learning curriculum experiments have been run at MIT Sloan, and many have been wildly successful. As this approach has caught on, and as some MBA programs have been criticized for an overemphasis on theory, many business schools around the world have been retrofitting action learning into their curricula. </p><h4>What are the advantages of action learning?</h4><p>Action learning improves the learning experience, as well as the market value of the graduating students.  Action learning projects enable students to learn how to apply theory and tools in complex, dynamic organizations while they are in school so they can add value in organizations much sooner once they get out of school.  Perched near the geographic and cultural center of an Asian continent with 3 billion people, ASB students will have the opportunity to engage with multiple projects in multiple countries, in addition to having a term of study at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Thus, ASB MBA graduates will have a truly global action learning background when they finish our program. Our partnerships with corporations throughout the region, allowing students to have the opportunity to do projects in, for example, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Hong Kong, will give them a deep appreciation of the challenges and heterogeneity of Asia and South-East Asia. Employees who comprehend global markets, global competition, and local cultures will be much more valuable to their employers. </p><h4>Does the ASEAN economic integration impact your outlook?</h4><p>South-East Asia seems like a particularly ripe area in which to bring more quality business education. I have a colleague who summarizes business strategy theory as “Find a lonely place on the frontier and then innovate.“ You want to be on the frontier, but you do not want to go where all the competition is. You want to go where there is less competition and where you can get a foothold and be successful, then innovate and continue to push the frontier. Relatively speaking, South-East Asia is a lonely place on the frontier. There are many good universities in this region, but it is not overly populated with them.  I believe there is enough room for an institution such as MIT to come in and establish itself as a premier partnership school for the region. We very much want ASB to be Asian in orientation, and we want to appeal to people who want an Asian component to their education, as opposed to a copy of a Western school located in Asia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia is part of the global trend toward the internationalization of higher education, with a number of prestigious foreign universities having set up branch campuses here. Why have they chosen Malaysia?</h4><p>In order to set up campuses you need lecturers, which requires the level of local talent that we are capable of providing. They also need students who are willing to pay, and we have that here as well. Students come in from China, India, and Indonesia, and the economic growth rate here of 5-6% is strong. We are promoting ourselves as an educational hub for the region; this is an appealing proposition for both students and staff, and we also enjoy solid government support. Our national bank (Bank Negara Malaysia), in collaboration with the MIT Sloan School of Management will be starting the Asian School of Business this fall, and we also have many schools in the private sector that are witnessing growing. </p><h4>What role do exchange programs play in fostering bilateral relations between Malaysia and other countries?</h4><p>Exchange programs are extremely important. We have students who come here from all over the world, including about 150 from the New Zealand and Australia, and we hope to see even more. We welcome students who attend summer study courses first as a tester for more lengthy study. Students from Mexico also come here, and we hope to attract more students from European countries. We have many students coming in from Australia in a reciprocity program we are keen to advance. Currently, there are about 104,000 international students studying in Malaysia. Out of this amount, 29,000 are pursuing postgraduate studies. This is encouraging as it shows that we have quality offerings and that international students, many of whom are sponsored, see Malaysia as a choice destination for advanced levels of higher education. </p><h4>What can be done to promote the subjects of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)?</h4><p>Science has to be encouraged at the high school level in order to promote learning in college and university. STEM promotion will help advance industries and research to where they need to be. Right now, we have a 40:60 ratio between science and the liberal arts, and we want to shift the balance further toward the sciences. Here the sciences are not a male-dominated subject, and we have an overall female ratio of around 70% at universities. At the Ministry, our Director General is a woman, and has two deputies who are both women. And there are many other women in the field as well. It is not as easy for women to achieve leadership positions, but it does start with education and we proud to have capable leaders at the forefront of the Ministry who are amazing women in their own right. </p><h4>What will your priorities be over the next 10 years? </h4><p>Ensuring that we realize the goals of our Higher Education Blueprint 2015-25 through the 10 shifts identified will be where most of focus lies over the next 10 years.  Right now our main focus is on producing holistic, entrepreneurial, and balanced graduates. Ultimately, what we do are for the students and they are our top priority. We deliver this through the integrated CGPA or iCGPA, a concept that we have been developing for the past six years, and which our professors have been testing out. In four to five years, the program should be fully integrated. Another area of focus is making sure that we have industries on campus. We want industries on campus to start teaching our students, and we want 30% of our lecturers to be people from outside. Our CEO Faculty Program works to make classes more relevant, and this is an initiative which we have in our Higher Education Blueprint. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[For Your Health]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[for-your-health]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Parkway Pantai is part of IHH Healthcare Berhad, the second largest healthcare group in the world. How does it leverage its parent company and the strength of its shareholders?</h4><p>Having a regional and global presence helps, because we have seen that things that work here in Malaysia also work in Turkey, Singapore, China, and India. That gives us an ability to make decisions about how best to go about managing our business. Our focus is building long-term defensible positions in our home markets, which are Malaysia, Singapore, and Turkey. We do that by delivering superior clinical outcomes and services, not just in the markets that we are already present but also in new markets that we are keen to go into, especially in Asia. Even though we are the second largest healthcare service provider, we remain focused on growing our business. Today, IHH already has over 7,000 beds across 10 countries at 39 hospitals. But we are still adding capacity and will eventually have over 10,000 beds across various geographies over the next two or three years. </p><h4>How does the group work to make Malaysia a hub for medical tourism?</h4><p>Malaysia is in a strong position because it serves a huge catchment area due to its prime location in the region, covering China and large parts of Asia, such as India, Indonesia and the Philippines. However, location alone is not enough if there are no services or facilities to cater for the needs of these travelers, which is where we come in—our standards and facilities at IHH are world class and we have hospitals that are JCI accredited. Secondly, medical travel cannot flourish without supporting infrastructure and good transportation links. On average, a patient coming from abroad for treatment will bring at least two relatives or friends who will need to stay somewhere, eat, and relax while the patient recovers. If there is a lack of basic tourism-related infrastructure such as hotels and accommodation, food and beverage, and shopping facilities, people will not come. That is why our facilities are strategically located—our larger hospitals, in Penang and Kuala Lumpur for example, are in the heart of the local commercial district, as is the new one we have just opened in Kota Kinabalu. </p><h4>How can academic institutions work with the private sector hospitals?</h4><p>Our industry relies heavily on human capital, and IHH has its own medical education arm—IMU Health—as part of its investment into the longer-term development for Malaysia's healthcare sector. There is a global shortage of good and experienced nurses. For a long time, Malaysia has been a net exporter of high-quality nurses. Our nurses have always been very marketable, even to Singapore, because of the multiculturalism in Malaysia. They typically leave for places such as the Middle East or to UK, and even to Australia. The majority of these nurses come back to Malaysia eventually, and when they do, they come back with global experience that they can apply locally. IHH, through IMU, has a large nursing school in Malaysia, International Medical College (IMC), where we train over 400 nurses a year who are well-regarded and in demand. As for doctors, we at IHH work closely with local universities to inform them of the sectors within healthcare that we foresee increased demand, which helps to gives them a sense of future needs. IHH also runs a large private medical university, International Medical University (IMU), the first private medical university in Malaysia with the right to confer medical degrees. Because it has been around for over 20 years, many of the original graduates have now become specialists serving in our Malaysia hospitals and across the globe. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The hospital is wholly owned by Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS). What is your relationship with the company?</h4><p>We have a Board of Directors consisting of PETRONAS staff. We are not governed by the board, rather we have our own management in place locally, however we are owned as an entity. We hold regular meetings to discuss issues, receive feedback, and work closely with its occupational health and health and safety unit. We have linkups with all the other oil and gas companies, such as Shell, ExxonMobil.</p><h4>What kind of clients do you see?</h4><p>This is a tertiary care hospital that covers a diversity of services. When we started out, people didn't even know this was a hospital; however, now we treat a variety of health concerns including strokes and cardiac arrests. We also have many patients who come in for cosmetic surgery, especially from Australia. We have a large pre-occupational health department; therefore, many people come for pre-employment on the oil rigs. In addition, we have an executive health center that offers comprehensive packages. We also have a scope of professional services, from robotic technology to oncology services. We offer a whole myriad of services.</p><h4>Prince Court has a partnership with Maybank. What other partnerships do you have?</h4><p>We have another partnership in Indonesia with Citi Bank. Basically, the credit card pays us the bill, and then there is a 0% interest installment for the patient to settle. It is a fair system. Citi Bank was the first in Indonesia and Maybank followed in its footsteps. There is a possibility that another bank will enter the market there, with HSBC, Standard Chartered or CIMB among the favorites.</p><h4>Prince Court is consistently ranked among the best for medical tourism. What are the advantages of Malaysia as a destination for healthcare?</h4><p>Due to our colonial past, much of our medical training has been British-based. The average consumer will choose a British qualification above one from Australia or the US. We have always been strong in post-graduate training, and being English-speaking helps. It is a combination of British and Australian-trained individuals, and then more recently local post-graduates. This has been one of our major strengths. The other aspect, which has been a matter of some debate in the region is that we have a fee schedule; therefore, the doctor cannot charge you above a set ceiling. There is a single rate, whether you are foreign or local. It will cost the same no matter who you are. Singapore has gone to a free market so there is no fee schedule; neither is there one in Thailand or Indonesia. For us, our expatriate and foreign patients comprise about a quarter of our patient load.</p><h4>From which markets are you seeing unprecedented growth? </h4><p>Kazakhstan is one, but I am not sure what triggered it. A trade mission from Kazakhstan came here about two years ago. The one drawback is that the direct flights only come from Almaty. There is no direct flight from the capital, Astana. We are in talks with the Ministry of Health and it is keen to work with us; however, it is about getting that relationship and the logistics going.</p><h4>What contribution will healthcare make to the Malaysian economy as the country moves toward 2020?</h4><p>If you look at the key economy areas for healthcare, it involves medical tourism, health insurance for foreign workers so that they don't burden the public sector, and then E&amp;E and medical devices. There are also generic pharmaceuticals. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The modernization of public sector administration has been at the top of the government's priorities in recent years. How would you assess the progress made by MAMPU?</h4><p>We have done a lot, but many ministries and agencies are not as up-to-date as we would like. However, most agencies and ministries have received our ideas smoothly. One important change that we have introduced is online exams. We used to have to organize different testing centers across the country to administer examinations for people applying to jobs in the public sector, even if there were just a few applicants. That was very taxing in terms of human resources, time, and money, but now we are going 100% online. Thanks to this modernization of human resources in the public sector, job seekers throughout Malaysia can take part as long as they have internet access. The questions are structured such that applicants will not be able to cheat, so we do not have to send supervisors, as we also know that there will be verification questions during follow-up face-to-face interviews. Another ASEAN country that wants to implement similar modernizations is Brunei. They are sending representatives here to learn from us and it has been a successful project. There are many new changes that we are introducing under the public service system transformation program.</p><h4>What are some of the challenges that you expect to face in the coming years in terms of improving public sector delivery?</h4><p>We currently have 70% of our services online. Due to financial constraints, some agencies could not participate in what we proposed because they have other priorities. In some cases, what they have now in terms of what they are doing cannot fit into our proposed system and they will have to make adjustments later on. We will give them one or two years to change their system before they can migrate to ours. Those are some of the not-so-major constraints, but it does delay the 100% target that we set. As a developing country that aspires to become a developed country in the next five to six years, we face a shortage of scientists in the field of ICT. We are still looking for scientists who really understand all of these areas and can take the lead. Another issue is that a large part of Malaysia is rural. Those who lag behind in terms of ICT knowledge pose a big challenge. We would like the rural demographic to benefit a lot from this modernization as well. We have tried our best to help in terms of providing free tablets and laptops; we spend hundreds of millions providing these resources under programs in place through the Malaysia Communications and Multimedia Commission. The government also receives contributions from various ICT companies and then politicians suggest where the resources should be allocated.</p><h4>MAMPU is working with the Multimedia Development Corporation (MDeC) on developing Malaysia's Big Data Framework. Could you elaborate on this?</h4><p>Data is everywhere, but we need to aggregate it under one big synchronized framework. We need to identify the trends revealed by big data or else we will miss a lot of opportunities. MAMPU is actively involved with developing big data capabilities. There are two important initiatives in place: the One Malaysia One Call Centre (1MOCC), and also the One Malaysia Training Centre (1MTC). These have really enabled us to improve quality, reduce costs, and increase the efficiency of our public services. For example, with the 1MTC we consolidated all of the various public facilities available throughout the country into one website. We save a lot of money, but not only that—whatever facilities we have under-utilized in the past are now being fully utilized with the 1MTC System. 1MOCC is a system for aggregating queries from the public. Our trained receptionists will answer or direct call to the relevant agencies while all of the information is stored. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the advantage of having the academy located here in Sabah?</h4><p>In Sabah, tourism is one of the highest growth industries and the largest industry, responsible for approximately more than 82,000 jobs and the third largest economic contributor to the state, where in 2014 a total of MYR6.328 billion in of tourism receipts were achieved. The general public and in particular the Sabahan youths are aware of the employment possibilities and opportunities that this industry has to offer both presently and in the coming years; therefore, a hospitality institute present the perfect vehicle for these potentials hoteliers to realize their ambitions. Second, Sabah is hugely attractive as a destination, not only domestically, but also internationally. This is true for business, leisure, and other activities. This boosts the potential and expanded target market for the future operations of the Academy. </p><h4>How are you working with the government to promote the development of human capital in the hospitality industry?</h4><p>As an accredited skills institute that specializes in Hospitality and Tourism training in Sabah, Ascot Academy has been and is currently working with various government ministries, agencies, and government linked companies. Cooperation between the government and the private sector is an essential component to raise the standards of our human capital development as well as positively providing feedback for future policy decision-making and implementation. One of the example of public and private cooperation that Ascot is involved with is the Malaysian Centre for Tourism &amp; Hospitality Education (MyCenThe), under the purview of the Prime Minister's Department through the Performance Management Delivery Unit or PEMANDU and has been introduced to refine the current talents of Malaysian hospitality and tourism players by offering recognized qualifications that has both the academic and skills requirements. Our most recent cooperation with the government is the Academy's involvement with the State's Tourism Cluster. This program is jointly headed by the Sabah Economic Development and Investment Authority (SEDIA) and Institute Development Studies (Sabah). The development of human capital for the tourism and hospitality industry in Sabah is one of its top priorities. Participants of this cluster which includes hospitality and tourism organizations, associations, education, and training institute identify the current and future challenges of the industry, brainstorming workable and measurable solutions and the best practice to execute these collectively agreed resolution</p><h4>What is your outlook for tourism in Sabah and Malaysia for the year ahead?</h4><p>The outlook for tourism in Sabah, Malaysia, and regionally remains optimistic. For Sabah specifically, our strategies in attracting existing and new visitors to the state continues to be a top priority. Last year's unfortunate incidents have been very challenging for the industry and fortunately the State Tourism Ministry through its agency; the Sabah Tourism Board was quick to response and implement rapid contingencies to tackle the shortcomings. Strategies such as restoring travelers' confidence, focus on domestic marketing, greater emphasis on other existing international markets, and exploring new potential markets have all proved to be worthwhile approaches as evident in the overall tourism receipt generated in 2014. Sabah has excellent tourist landmarks such the recognized World Heritage Site of Mount Kinabalu, the oldest rainforest in the world at Maliau Basin, and one of the top three diving spots in the globe at Sipadan. Attractive and unique tourist spots are what drives a traveller to a particular destination but it is the services rendered by the locals that makes the experience a memorable one, which will result in repeated visits. Sabahans are naturally friendly, warm and humble; so we are already halfway there, we just need to enhance their professionalism and skills. And it is this enhancement that will determine the positive long-term sustainability of Sabah and Malaysia's tourism outlook. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Ministry encouraging sustainable tourism, in line with its goal of making Sabah the premier eco-tourism destination in Malaysia?</h4><p>Sabah is truly blessed with an abundance of incredible natural beauty and resources—our greatest asset. The challenge is how to conserve them, so our holistic approach, therefore, better enables us to control and organize all actions, events, and policies concerning eco-tourism and nature conservation. The greatest challenge to contend with is greed, as so many seek to make extract profits now without considering the preservation of the commons for the future. Up to 55% of Sabah will always be comprised of protected forests. Up to 21% is comprised of Totally Protected Areas and this will increase to 30% by 2025. By next year, we will have two million hectares of marine park. Timber was long Sabah's main revenue generator. Our revenue from timber was reduced from $1 billion per year to just $120-140 million last year in response to government cutbacks in issuing licenses. Meanwhile, tourism revenues rose to $6.3 billion last year—what we lost in timber we gained in tourism. Naturally, people and companies that made their living in the timber industry are hugely disappointed. Our rainforest is the oldest in the world, over 120 million years old, and therefore the responsibility to preserve it lies with us. </p><h4>How will the Goods and Services Tax (GST) affect the tourism industry in Sabah?</h4><p>We recently presented a strong argument as to why domestic travel in Malaysia should not be subject to GST, especially Sabah, Sarawak, and Kuala Lumpur. In peninsular Malaysia, the trains, buses, and even commuters are GST exempt because these are “essential services." However, in Sabah and Sarawak, vis-í -vis Kuala Lumpur, we have no choice but to fly for all essential services and this will be subject to the GST. Domestic travel will cost more, which will discourage many Malaysians from traveling within their own country. Over 90% of our visitors to Sabah arrive by air, so a 6% GST will negatively impact tourism and visits. It's still too early to see what the impact will be, but this seems the likely scenario.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the tourism industry for the year ahead?</h4><p>I hope for a better performance, but expect a challenging environment. Europe still faces severe economic challenges, so we do not expect much of a rise in European arrivals. Chinese economic growth also dropped to 7% last year, which may mean less Chinese traveling overseas. Sabah has long been a natural destination, being a mere five hour journey from China, and less than three hours from Hong Kong. There are now more billionaires and multimillionaires in China, and they all tend to head for London, Paris, Latin America, and even Africa. As they travel further away, places like Sabah will see less of them and will have to compete more for Chinese tourists. Tourism Malaysia is targeting 29.4 million tourists this year (an increase of 7.2%). By 2020 the tourism is expected to generate RM168 billion in receipts with 36 million tourist arrivals as outlined in Malaysia Tourism Transformation Plan (MTTP) 2020. The Economic Impact Report by the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) reported that the total contribution of Travel &amp; Tourism to GDP was MYR158.2bn (16.1% of GDP) in 2013, and is forecast to rise by 6.8% in 2014 continue 4.5% per annum to MYR262.5bn (17.3% of GDP) by 2024. In 2013, the total contribution of Travel &amp; Tourism to employment, including jobs indirectly supported by the industry, was 14.1% of total employment. This is expected to rise by 4.8% in 2014 and rise by 3.1% annually to 2,648,000 jobs in 2024. The World Tourism Organization (WTO) estimates 4.5% growth this year, and hopefully we will se some of that growth. Nonetheless, we prefer to temper our optimism with realistic expectations. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[manufactured-ascent]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the state of industry in Sabah at the moment?</h4><p><span></span>The manufacturing sector on the Malaysian Peninsula contributes almost 30% to GDP. Unfortunately, here in Sabah, the manufacturing sector is not growing in the manner we would like. The industrial sector used to contribute about 28% to GDP in terms of investing volume. That figure has now dropped to about 7%. Although we have a new sector coming in, namely oil and gas, which is new and exciting in terms of energy, we still did not manage to get past 7% contribution to GDP. This means the traditional sector of manufacturing has seriously declined and it is a concern that we have raised with the government. Manufacturing covers different levels of activity, from primary to secondary and even high value-added tertiary. This is one of the reasons that we decided not only to focus on purely manufacturing, but also to expand to cover other industries, including oil and gas, palm oil, and downstream value-added activities. We opened the gap and widened our perspective in terms of involvement in the industrial sector. It has been less than two years since these changes were decided in 2013, and officially became effective in 2014. We are moving ahead, but not as we had intended.</p><h4>How are your resources spread between start-ups, SMEs, and the larger companies?</h4><p>Our main goal is to provide information to all members, regardless of scale. For new and young companies wanting to do business in manufacturing or other sectors, we provide people to advise them. When foreigners arrive, they often do not know how to go about applying for licenses. Even though if it might be a company's first time in Sabah, we make business possible by providing the right assistance. <br>We work with all company sizes. It is not easy to look after all of them; however, that does not mean that we lack interest in smaller companies. We also undertake arbitration for foreign companies that have suffered irregularities at the hand of local companies or local authorities, and we investigate related cases. </p><h4>Which businesses are key to the region, and what opportunities do they present for investment?</h4><p>A new policy is likely to be introduced into lumber or timber to reduce the number of trees felled. Around two decades ago, we were the largest producer in Malaysia. We exported vast amounts of lumber, but we unfortunately over-logged our land. The government decided to stop cutting down whatever trees were left. Unfortunately, illegal logging is still going on. The government is now doing a good job of protecting the forests in Sabah. An important line of business is of course palm oil, which is the most marketable crop in the sense that every part of the palm oil is commercially applicable, be it is the kernel or the leaf. Malaysia used to be the largest palm oil producer in the world, but we have unfortunately been overtaken by Indonesia. In other sectors, such as cocoa, Malaysia and Indonesia are the largest producers. We also have Sabah chocolate from this region. The types of crops we have are marketable, and there is demand worldwide. Even the tea and coffee that are produced here are in demand. The market has never been exhausted, and the question is how to invest in the sectors, add value, and extract economic benefits from them. </p><h4>How do you assess the importance of Sabah currently and in the future as an industrial hub for ASEAN?</h4><p>The federal government must have the determination to make Sabah the major industrial and logistics hub within the ASEAN region. There is also potential to develop Sabah as a Halal hub for the Islamic sector. If we work towards this goal, Sabah can undergo an economic transformation much like the one experienced by Dubai in the Middle East. We also have support from the ASEAN community itself. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the state's key agricultural initiatives and how does the ministry oversees them?</h4><p>The Sabah Agro-Industrial Park started under the charge of our Chief Minister, and began as an entity of agriculture. The sector is calling for our advice in regard to animal and veterinary care. The park is very much business oriented; however, we are not conducting business, but rather making policy and issuing licenses. The government has to create the scenario in which business can be conducted, which is why we have entities like the Sabah Foundation. They are also involved in aquaculture there. Plantations, such as those grown for palm oil production, are not under our charge. We only deal with small planters, and most of the larger parts are working with the Ministry of Industry. That ministry is located at a federal level, which is where the Palm Oil Industrial Cluster (POIC) is dealt with. I am only charged with the food industry to include rice where the objective is to maximize the yield.</p><h4>Has the boom in development in Sabah brought on any additional challenges for the ministry?</h4><p>It has been a challenge because some of our land meant for agriculture is being taken away with the purpose of sowing paddy fields or boosting industry. This has reduced the resources we have to plant paddies. There is a competition for land use, and most of our good land is along the west coast, which also happens to be where the town centres are; therefore, the appropriate land is being developed along road connections. There is definitely competition with the palm oil sector, and today stakeholders are working to redevelop forests along the river to restore conditions for indigenous fauna.</p><h4>What is the state of play in terms of transforming Sabah into a halal hub?</h4><p>There is a great opportunity for this if it is implemented correctly. We are trying to import animals from Australia, slaughter them here, and then re-export them. We do not have enough room for livestock here except for chickens, whereas Australia does. We are able to export the animals that we get in with a high disease-free percentage, and we have been recognized by the World Organization for Animal Health for our advances against disease. Sabah has more land available for agriculture compared to West Malaysia, and many are looking to the land here for agricultural development. We are looking at attracting investors from overseas to use our port facilities. We do have some current limitations, such as feed resources, but there is still significant potential for poultry products to be processed downstream in the halal industry. The majority of people locally are Muslims and are keen products of this nature. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-blueprint-for-success]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your assessment of how Sabah is situated for development?  </h4><p>The federal government has designated Kota Kinabalu as one of the four cities on the economic hit list under the 11 Malaysia Plan (11MP). We welcome the development assigned to Kota Kinabalu, especially in improving the public transportation sector, connectivity, safety, social services, ICT communications, landscape, and recreational parks. It will be transformed into a gateway for the natural wonders in Borneo. The vibrancy of Kota Kinabalu is further enhanced by the recent completion of the ecofriendly Oceanus shopping mall and the Imago integrated commercial development. In the medical sector, we have the Gleneagles Medical Center and the Jesselton Medical Center, which is a major improvement in our private medical service for the whole state. There are a number of development projects in the pipeline that will change the skyline and the lives of the people living here. The Sabah International Convention Center will further promote Kota Kinabalu as a major MICE destination.  </p><h4>How will new infrastructure projects open up new areas of trade? </h4><p>The Pan Borneo Highway is a critical project for Sabah. It will form the much-needed infrastructural backbone of the state. Spanning more than 1,000km across Sabah, it will connect major cities, towns, and districts. It is the key catalyst that will unleash the growth potential in both the urban and rural districts of Sabah. Connectivity and accessibility are important enablers for social and economic development. The decreased transportation costs that the highway will bring about will encompass all sectors of the economy including agriculture, tourism, manufacturing, property development, and a whole range of services sector. Another exciting development in the northern part of Sabah is the collaboration with the Palawan province of the Philippines to promote bilateral trade and tourism. The federal government has already granted $2.1 million for construction of a ramp in Kudat port to prepare for the sea linkage. With the establishment of a sea linkage, we can export items such as building materials, household and electrical goods, all of which are in high demand in Palawan. At the same time, we can import agriculture products like pineapple, bananas, and seafood. </p><h4>With such a huge amount of economic development, how is the government striking up balance between gains in the private sector and raising the standard of living? </h4><p>Economic development brings more opportunities for the people. Jobs are created and invariably that would also elevate the standard of living of the people here. When we are talking about development of a state, we always have to keep in mind three inextricably connected aspects: economy, society, and environment. The state of Sabah has the Sabah Development Corridor, and we have many different sectorial plans in tourism and agriculture. We are now formulating a holistic plan for the state to move forward in line with the rest of the country toward becoming a developed nation. We have been working on the Sabah Strategic Long Term Action Plan (Sabah LEAP), and with this plan we envision that Sabah will leap from a state where we have considerable poverty, low electricity in rural areas, and a commodity-based economy, to an economically vibrant, innovative, knowledgeable, sustainable, competent, and investment friendly state. Our vision statement from 2016 to 2025 is that the people of Sabah will lead productive and meaningful lives in harmony with nature and supported by a vibrant and sustainable economy, conserving it for future generations.</p><h4>Which industries are most prominent within this plan?</h4><p>We have identified new growth areas, such as the creative industry: art, performing arts, and things like that. We are also optimistic about the oil and gas industry, and with new investors we think it can be an engine of growth in our economy that will create more opportunities in downstream activities. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of the Ministry of Industrial Development here in Sabah?</h4><p>The role of Ministry of Industrial Development is critical to the development of Sabah in the context of Malaysia's drive for “developed economy“ status by 2020 and also Sabah's own 2006-15 development blueprint to elevate the industry sector's share of the state GDP. Sabah does not want to continue to be an exporter of commodities. This is not sustainable. What we are trying to do now is to value-add to our timber, palm oil, biomass, crude oil and gas, as well as other resources to grow the manufacturing sector. Over the last 10 or 15 years, we have driven manufacturing and addressed infrastructure issues to attract more investments. </p><h4>What changes are you implementing in the industry sectors to make them both more sustainable and profitable? </h4><p>Countries do not have to sacrifice the environment for industrial growth. Instead, they can use technology to create growth. Profits and sustainability are both sides of the same coin. We have aggressive programs to encourage the optimization of resources such as in biomass and developing high-value derivative products from palm oil. Sabah is still 60% forest. Few countries are able to retain that percentage of forest. We maintain forest management through the right application of technology and the correct use of resources especially with palm oil. There has been much development in the area of recycling biomass, what we call “turning waste to wealth.“ There are many downstream processes that we can undertake in a controlled environment. We are also introducing products that are from agro-based chemicals. This helps to supplement the plantations where 50% of their costs are in fertilizers and pesticides. </p><h4>To what extent are you involved in the state energy projects?</h4><p>We own Sipitang Oil and Gas Industrial Park (SOGIP), and we are actively soliciting investors from all over the world. SOGIP taps into the oil and gas produced in Sabah's off-shore fields. PETRONAS (Malaysia's national petroleum company) is the major investor for the moment. It owns and operates the SAMUR project, which produces ammonia and urea. The Sabah government is also a shareholder in SAMUR. We want to build up the industry through partnerships and we are reaching out to investors from Europe and the US that utilize green technology to make chemical products from gas and plantation by-products. The Malaysian government encourages small-scale energy production from renewable sources such as solar and biomass.</p><h4>What are your primary markets, and what do you see as the economic potential for increasing regional connectivity?</h4><p>We tailor our offerings based on the resources that we have, which are oil and gas, crude palm oil, biomass and timber.  In addition, we also have farms culturing seaweed, prawns, and lobsters for export. Tourism is another asset, and is an industry in itself that offers many investment opportunities in hotel and resort development. Logistics and its related business also have huge potential because of the geographical location of Sabah in the center of ASEAN. We are located in the ASEAN sub-region of BIMP-EAGA (Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area) and are within a four-hour flight radius of major business capitals such as China, Japan, Singapore and Korea. We have 10% of the ASEAN in the BIMP-EAGA region; therefore, we are talking about a market of 60 million, not just the 3 million of Sabah. The key is linking our resources through terrestrial, maritime and air connectivity. BIMP-EAGA supplies most of the world's coal and palm oil and is also a major producer of lauric oil, minerals, oil &amp; gas, cocoa, rubber, and marine products. The BIMP-EAGA territories also have World Heritage sites, and we are promoting our destinations together. Maritime connectivity will help develop more efficient shipping services, which are critical to the development of industries and bringing the manufactured products to the world. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Your primary business is to import and distribute, but you are also involved in manufacturing. Can you explain this business model further and the importance of the distribution deal with Mazda?</h4><p>Bermaz Motors initially started distributing Mazda products by importing completely built units (CBU) from Mazda Corporation Japan. Their popularity, a result of the attractive design and advanced technology, encouraged us to further increase our business activities to include local production. A completely knocked down (CKD) program was established to be in-line with our National Automotive Policy (NAP). Incentives are provided under this policy to ensure that the investments for local manufacturing are adequately recovered through competitive pricing and added volume sales. The increased local production activities and the benefits accorded by the government under the NAP gave rise to a joint venture between Mazda Corporation and Bermaz Motor to establish a manufacturing company, Mazda Malaysia. The Malaysian automotive industry is encouraged by the government to embark on local industrial activities, CKD production, and component parts manufacturing. There are two national automobile producers in Malaysia, PROTON and PERODUA. Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and other Japanese brands also have assembly and production facilities in Malaysia, as CBU imports are restricted. Therefore, in order to increase our sales volume we have to also undertake local production activities. The joint venture with Mazda Corporation ensures that we have the necessary support from the principal manufacturer to undertake local production and ensure quality is maintained. With localization of components supported by Mazda Corporation and their Japanese vendors, we are able to secure a local cost content of 40%. This enables us to receive tax rebates from the government under the NAP and we can export to certain ASEAN countries under the ASEAN Free Trade Agreement (AFTA). </p><h4>What are the main characteristics of the AFTA?</h4><p>The main advantage of the AFTA is the opportunity of free trade within the major ASEAN constituent countries, such as Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, and the Philippines, which are actively involved in the auto industry. The AFTA allows for free imports of vehicles to these major countries without restrictions on imports and there is no tariff imposed on the imports. In another words, there is neither a tariff nor other non-tariff barriers under the AFTA scheme. However, products to be imported under the AFTA scheme should have a minimum ASEAN local content of 40%.</p><h4></h4><h4>What progress has been achieved through Mazda's SkyActiv green technology?<br></h4><p>The SkyActiv Technology basically involves the improvements of the internal combustion engines' efficiency and the use of light, high tensile steel in the body structure to improve the weight and structural rigidity, therefore improving the total structural strength. The transmission is improved to reduce frictional losses and more direct and positive gear changes. The steering and suspension systems are also improved to ensure more linear driving characteristic. The total SkyActiv package therefore ensures that the vehicle is more efficient in engine performance and driving characteristics.</p><h4>To what do you attribute the company's growth and high profitability?</h4><p>The success of the company is due to various factors. We come from a very low base and the opportunity for growth is there. It is a matter of convincing consumers that we have the best technology and that this technology is sustainable. In order to be sustainable we must provide a good ownership experience. We have started a program where we provide consumers, namely Mazda owners, with a totally stress-free first three years of ownership, with totally free maintenance and complete warranty coverage. As a result, the retention factor is very high and our CSI rating is good. Mazda owners are well informed of the technology and design of Mazda models and usually act as our ambassadors through their various social activities in the Mazda Owners' Club. This improved brand image allows us to price our Mazda vehicles at a slight premium over our competitors. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[light-years-ahead]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The promotion of science and technology has been high on the government's agenda. Which high technology industries are particularly important for Malaysia?</h4><p>All high technology sectors have importance in the nation-building scenario. Since we were formed in 1993, we have looked at more than 25 high technology sectors. Aerospace is one of them, not only because of its ability to generate business but because of its ability to fulfill the aspirations of a country that wants to become industrialized or developed. All of the most advanced technology lies in aerospace; it is one of the most regulated industries because it requires discipline and you need to comply, be certified, and approved before entering. Therefore, the aerospace sector became in a sense the flagship for high technology development. Before that, it was the automotive industry that led the cause. The creation of Proton gave us insight into what high-tech industries are all about. At the other end, we are looking into areas of telecommunication, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and nanotechnology as well. </p><h4>How is Malaysia moving toward high technology exports?</h4><p>We are one of the top ten manufacturers of the world, especially in terms of electrical and electronics (E&amp;E). In other areas of commodities, we are also a major exporter. We are always thinking of the added value and we always compare ourselves to Singapore, where the added value is around 70-80% compared to 30% in Malaysia. There is, therefore, still room for improvement. In commodities, we have been talking to companies such as Sime Darby and Felda about going into downstream activities, which are less subject to market fluctuations. Their responses have been positive and we are seeing investments from them and others in R&amp;D and manufacturing. We also leverage foreign investments from groups like MIDA and MATRADE to fuel development in the high technology sectors. Most potential investors in high technology first want to be familiar with the competitive environment of a country because they need to know whether there are suppliers of essential materials or components, and MIGHT is able to provide that knowledge to investors. One of these investors is Spirit Aero Systems, from the UK, which is a Tier-1 supplier to Airbus and Boeing. Investments like this help develop the market in Malaysia, making it easier for new SMEs to operate and in turn enhance our capacity to export high technology products.</p><h4>How does the new National Aerospace Blueprint differ from previous master plans?</h4><p>This is the second blueprint to be introduced. The first one was from 1995 to 2015—a 20-year guide to bring Malaysia's aerospace industry from almost zero to a $4.6 billion industry. The new blueprint focuses on four priority areas. One area of focus is parts and components manufacturing. Another area is Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO), where we want to capture a larger share of the market. In the first blueprint, we aimed for 5%, and we achieved that target—now we are pushing for 10%. This calls for different types of competency; whoever develops this type of capability first will win the larger market share so we are pushing to get into these composite maintenance and repair capabilities. We are also focusing on developing avionics. In the new blueprint, we focus on systems integration and recently on the Internet of Things, which is also going to somehow be integrated into that activity. Finally, there is a fourth area of focus on training and education. We will need thousands of skilled workers as more facilities are being opened. The one thing that we like in the current development is that the work in Singapore is spilling over into Malaysia; therefore, we might see a lot of aerospace activity in the southern part of Malaysia, which was not there before. The ultimate objective is to become the aerospace industry hub for the ASEAN region.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is being done to develop and retain talent in the fields of science, technology, and innovation?</h4><p>The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MoSTI) has always recognized the importance of human capital development to achieve not only its organizational goal, but also more importantly its contribution to the national vision. At MoSTI, we have a special program called the Human Capital Development for Science, Technology, and Innovation (HCD STI Program), which provides training grants to enhance the competency and develop the technical expertise of our STI talents. MoSTI is the only ministry allocated with this special fund for specialized training in technical areas on top of the normal budget for generic training. This fund enables MoSTI's employees, especially those in technical services, to pursue trainings specific to their work scope. Modes of implementation vary from sending people to attend certified courses to training at highly reputable research institutes, both local and overseas. We also bring in world-renowned experts to conduct customized training at various agencies. These training courses often result in a strong network between MoSTI and its agencies with international R&amp;D institutions and regulatory bodies, leading to research collaboration, as well as knowledge and technology transfer. Through this HCD STI Program, MoSTI has been able to nurture and enhance high performing local experts, retain them, and simultaneously gain advanced knowledge from global experts.</p><h4>CyberSecurity Malaysia was established as an agency under MoSTI. What role can the cyber security industry play in Malaysia's development?</h4><p>The role of CyberSecurity Malaysia is to provide specialized services to ensure the security and safety of Malaysia's cyber space. It is part of our contribution toward supporting Malaysia in becoming a digital and high-income nation driven by a knowledge-based economy. Our focus, as reflected in the National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP), is on the protection of the Critical National Information Infrastructure (CNII), upon which governments, businesses, and citizens are highly reliant. CNII enables the nation to function and acquire critical services. In today's highly competitive global market place, any disruptions to the CNII, including data loss, damage, cyber attacks, and other cyber crimes, can cause anxiety and significantly impact Malaysia's economic competitiveness. Perpetrators can access information systems or use other electronic means to launch cyber attacks against critical information infrastructure, such as financial, energy, transportation, and government operations. The online banking system and electrical distribution grid could be crippled by shutting down their control systems. Cyber attacks can also sabotage airport traffic control systems and government operations can be disrupted with attacks on the national network services. This underscores the strategic role of CyberSecurity Malaysia in driving the economy toward greater growth and progress by ensuring infrastructure and digital assets are protected and safeguarded against cyber security threats. </p><h4>What role will STI play in advancing Malaysia's human capital and socio-economic development?</h4><p>In order to meet global and local STI challenges, Malaysians must be equipped with STEM knowledge to meet the increasing demand for engineers, healthcare workers, scientists, computer programmers, actuaries, and other related professions. The government has shifted its focus toward emerging technologies, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, and advanced manufacturing, as well as expanding existing STI based sectors. The Economic Transformation Programme (ETP) in Malaysia, which has identified 12 National Key Economic Areas (NKEAs), is covering two such areas related to the technology and innovation sector, namely electronic and electrical engineering, as well as communications, content, and infrastructure. The sector accounts for $10.3 billion, or 6% of GNI and $70 billion, or 40%, of total exports. It also provides approximately 522,000 jobs for skilled and semi-skilled workers. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Schlumberger marks its 80th year in Malaysia in 2015. What has contributed to the company's ongoing success here?</h4><p>Our company's anniversary was actually in May 2015, and accordingly we wanted to demonstrate and celebrate our commitment to the country. In collaboration with MIDA, we established the first Center for Reliability and Efficiency, a multi-million dollar investment that is part of a worldwide Schlumberger transformation program launched by our CEO back in June 2012.  With a decrease of more than 50% in the oil price since the summer of 2014, the market reality has changed our estimations and growth prospects here. Nevertheless, we went ahead with our investments, and looked for ways to improve our efficiency and our service delivery, and ensure we had the resources to carry out these goals. Our workforce is now around 73% Malaysian nationals, with many in leadership positions, and we are proud of that. We will continue to invest in Malaysia. It is an attractive place to do business. The facilities from MIDA and InvestKL, for example, are all encouraging, not only to Schlumberger but also to other industries and businesses.</p><h4>What are some of the peculiarities of operating in this market?</h4><p>For Malaysia to attract international organizations, it needs to facilitate business. By this, I mean not just giving a piece of land to operate on, but also providing financial incentives; it has been excellent at that. Also, in terms of logistics, Malaysia's proximity to Singapore makes conducting business easier and faster. Another factor that differentiates Malaysia is that there is no shortage of national talent, at any level or discipline. Malaysia is a beautiful country and the lifestyle is good, and this standard makes it attractive in terms of bringing in expatriates who are willing to work and live here. All these factors have helped create a competitive market. Finally, Malaysia is a stable and secure country, both just politically and financially. </p><h4>What impact have foreign firms had on the oil and gas sector in Malaysia?</h4><p>They have had a significant impact. PETRONAS and the government realize that attracting foreign companies is crucial to developing the country's oil and gas resources. Up to 50% of blocks are currently being developed by foreign firms, ranging from major international oil companies to independent ones. They also support a unique model that encourages local companies to participate in exploration and production. Hence, you see companies such as SapuraKencana and Petra Energy taking part of the new business landscape. These companies are creating joint ventures with international companies. It is a unique business environment. I have worked in different countries around the world, and I have never seen such a diverse mix of business models. The majors and the independents are all still interested in this market.</p><h4>You established a Research &amp; Engineering (R&amp;E) center in Penang in 2011. How successful has it been?</h4><p>One thing you can never compromise on is technology innovation, and we continue to spend upwards of $1.2 billion a year in R&amp;E globally. The R&amp;E center in Penang is specifically dedicated to seismic manufacturing and project development. We extended that facility last year, doubling its size to include other service lines such as logging and directional drilling services. Penang has many other electronic and mechanical institutes and talents already there. Therefore, it is becoming a regional hub with a focus on mechanical engineering. In Negeri Sembilan, under the local development program, we created a partnership with a Malaysian company called Omni to develop and manufacture completion equipment. In this successful project, we serve both Malaysia and the globe, including markets such as Saudi Arabia. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the company evolved from being a shareholder in MCIS Zurich to what it is today?</h4><p>As a 40% shareholder of MCIS Zurich, we had a strong relationship with them. In time, we had to decide whether we were going to pursue serious growth in Malaysia or exit the market. We concluded that it was a market that we wanted to grow in, and so in 2012 we acquired MAA, which has operated in Malaysia for 48 years. Since the acquisition, we have been executing some serious integration work with our group to align better strategically, whilst still focusing to grow the business locally. </p><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of an established local presence — what is unique about operating in Malaysia?</h4><p>Malaysia is one of the fastest growing markets in Southeast Asia. As a group, we want to make APAC a sizeable market for Zurich on the whole, and having a strong foothold in Malaysia can assist us in that. Malaysia, as we know it, has a vast and diverse economic landscape. It is also a land with many opportunities for various markets, such as the Takaful and the SME markets. This has given us an edge over the market. </p><h4>How did Optimuz come about?</h4><p>Optimuz has been specially designed for SME business owners, and covers both general and life insurance aspects, thus making it an all-in-one holistic solution for small business owners. Optimuz provides a simple solution for customers to empower their decisions in protecting their business. It provides customers with the privilege to choose a 360° coverage and protection for those they truly love, be it their assets or employees. The plan comes in different approaches, therefore giving the customers the ease and convenience to do business. </p><h4>What makes this different from what is already offered to SMEs?</h4><p>Most of what is currently offered to SMEs is prepackaged. The most commonly sought-after form of insurance for SMEs is protection against fire liabilities. However, most prepackaged insurance offerings can also include many others kinds of protection  for which SMEs are paying premiums but do not necessarily need. Our approach is different because Optimuz was developed to be intelligent and robust in order to empower our customers, agents and employees. It is simple and convenient as it allows fast flow underwriting, anytime and anywhere. This approach provides a dedicated team of underwriters for our SME customers and we provide insurance coverage, which is relevant and customizable to meet the needs of our customers.</p><h4>Detariffication of motor and fire insurance will begin in 2016. How is this going to impact the industry and what opportunities will it bring? </h4><p>Detariffication will not only lead to more informed consumers, but also help them to distinguish between value and price. For Zurich Insurance, this is about creating value directly around our process so that we do not end up engaging in bidding wars. Currently, there is capacity in the market so average rates are declining. After detarriffication, this trend should continue as insurers will want to gain market share. This tends to lead to market volatility, as those firms losing money are obliged to increase rates again. Zurich's aim is to create consistency within the pricing model and ensure that every product that we offer will continue adding value. </p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016?</h4><p>We have identified a couple of key initiatives for 2016. First, we have to separate our composite license in line with new regulations. We also need to adapt to the changes brought about by detariffication in order to continue creating value and understanding our customers in the new competitive landscape. In a more liberalized market, segmentation becomes crucial. Much of our focus is now on creating and leveraging on differentiated value propositions through matching our unique service offering to the appropriate market segments. Malaysia is a strategically high-priority market, and one in which our ownership will continue to invest. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IBFIM operates as an industry-owned institute. How does this dictate both the financing and the operations of the institute? </h4><p><span></span>IBFIM is unique and quite different from any other Islamic finance support institution in the world. IBFIM is an industry-owned and regulator-linked institute. The key stakeholders are the regulator, the Islamic finance industry players which transcend sub-sectors like commercial and investment banking, development banking, Takaful, Retakaful, Takaful brokering, capital markets, and wealth management. IBFIM's charter dictates that the regulator and all related industry associations are represented on IBFIM's board, and a board meeting could only be convened with the presence of the regulator's representative. That goes to show the kind of commitment that the Malaysian Central Bank—Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM)—has to the promotion of Islamic finance. There are no corporate membership fees or annual financial contributions by the stakeholders to finance IBFIM. Independently, IBFIM has to be financially sustainable. For that, IBFIM offers not just training but  also consultancy, Shariah business advisory (where IBFIM controls more than 40% share of its specialized market), event management, and knowledge management; IBFIM is a full-fledged publishing house specializing in Islamic finance titles, and also an active player down the publication value chain acting as distributors as well as retailers to Islamic finance publications.</p><h4>It is estimated that IBFIM has trained 32% of the workforce in Malaysia. What developments are in place to increase this percentage? Could this include any potential collaboration with global financial institutions? </h4><p>That was five years ago, but since then we have restrategized. Market dynamism dictates that the percentage of Islamic workforce is very fluid, and talents are shared between conventional and Islamic sectors. With the industry practicing shared resources, the fact that Islamic finance is made up of four main sub-sectors or specializations, and new growth areas are emerging, double-counting becomes ineluctable. IBFIM defines the Islamic finance talent development border now. After all, that is what leaders are for. In that new expanded space, IBFIM has increased its role and maintained its lead. To again increase the momentum, IBFIM did collaborate with other global institutes, associations, and financial institutions. NIFTI (Network of Islamic Finance Training Institutes) with more than thirty affiliates globally, is an example.</p><h4>Malaysia has the highest number of sukuk issuances. What do you perceive to make these sukuk so attractive for businesses?</h4><p>To the issuers, tax incentives and bigger investor base, including fund managers, are the pull factors, though the motivations may differ. To the investors, variegated offerings in the forms of type and tenure, and the growing secondary market are motivations enough. In the years to come,  the global sukuk market is one area of Islamic finance that will be interesting to watch.</p><h4>Malaysia sits second, only behind Iran, in the Islamic Finance Country Index. How can this gap be closed on the global industry leader?</h4><p>I believe Malaysia is happy to be where it is. It is not the ranking, but the fulfillment of what is Shariah and innovating along the way. Structurally, the industry differs from country to country. Malaysia believes in growing together in shaping Islamic finance and creating more vibrant marketplaces, not in overtaking or leading any jurisdiction. Within our own industry structure, we know what we want to do next. BNM had come up with a good blueprint for the next ten years, and we are now witnessing changes and initiatives along the way. The recently introduced Islamic Financial Services Act 2013 (IFSA), for example, is an initiative in the right direction. Already we are witnessing the industry players adapting and the industry advancing. </p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of the IBFIM over the coming few years?</h4><p>IBFIM supports the BNM's Financial Sector Blueprint and is aware of its mandate spelled out in the Blueprint. IBFIM strives to fulfill the mandate. Among others, IBFIM now is actively looking into Islamic wealth management, though the sub-sector is still in its infancy and the challenges are daunting. Other new growth areas have been identified, and IBFIM is now pursuing them. Malaysia is pursuing professionalism in talent development, and BNM has put the mechanisms in place. It is time to deliver now. IBFIM has lined up at least three professional qualifications now: the Chartered Islamic Banker (CIB), Chartered Takaful Practitioner (CTP), and Chartered Islamic Development Banker (ChIDB). This is in addition to IBFIM's other industry qualifications like the Certified Qualification in Islamic Finance (CQIF). By extension, then, the next logical thing to do is to bridge the university-industry gap. IBFIM has a head start on this. Finally, to achieve a quantum leap, IBFIM needs to redefine its business model in the realm of information and knowledge as the next business frontier. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia is the world's largest sukuk issuer and holds around a quarter of the world's Islamic assets. That said, are there challenges that the industry still needs to overcome?</h4><p>The lack of liquidity of most sukuks hampers the growth of the market. Many investors seek sukuks for their investment book and normally, they would be held until maturity. Investors that place a high value on liquidity may avoid sukuks entirely because of the absence of a secondary market. The liquidity also harms dedicated sukuk investors, because it leads to comparatively large bid-ask spreads and limits their investment strategies and portfolio diversification opportunities. The second challenge that needs to be addressed is a lack of uniform interpretations across jurisdictions. This matter further hinders the growth of the market. Structures that are deemed acceptable in one market may not be equally accepted in another jurisdiction. The most frequently cited example of this divergence in interpretation is the difference between structures that are considered tradable in Malaysia and those that can be traded in most GCC countries. Such lack of uniformity limits the depth of the market for any particular sukuk issue. Another issue is the lack of legal certainty in the sukuk market; for example, the extent to which courts will consider sharia compliance in evaluating the enforceability of an Islamic Finance contract remains an open question in most jurisdictions. As a result, there is a risk that a contractual obligation that would otherwise be found to be enforceable under the governing law of the contract may nonetheless be determine to be unenforceable due to some deficiency in its compliance with Sharia principles. Finally, the sukuk market suffers from a lack of frequent sovereign issues, in particular, high quality sovereign issues. Frequent, high quality sovereign issuance plays an important role in the development of all capital markets; as such issues serve the critical purpose of building a benchmark yield curve of the market. Without such benchmark yield curve, it is difficult for other issuers as well as investors to access the market with confidence. In addition, the availability of such frequent sovereign issues would help Islamic financial institutions to meet the regulatory requirements on capital compositions.</p><h4>What role can Malaysia play in exporting Islamic finance to other countries? </h4><p>Malaysia can share its experience and expertise on development of the Islamic marketplace, which is characterized by a robust regulatory, supervisory, sharia and legal framework, a deep primary and active secondary sukuk market, an efficient and transparent price discovery platform, and a diverse talent base with global capabilities and efficient multi-currency clearing and settlement. The marketplace enables the international financial community to benefit from the offering that caters to global jurisdictions, markets, and career needs. Malaysia also welcomes new market players to leverage its expertise and to establish operations in Malaysia. The key value proposition offered by Malaysia's marketplace is an end-to-end Sharia compliant business environment. In addition, Malaysia has set the pace for innovative development of new Sharia-compliant investment products to cater for market needs. The Malaysian Islamic capital market has experienced phenomenal growth and raised the bar globally for product innovation and financial intermediation. This market comprises the Islamic equity sector and fixed income. Malaysia also recently updated the sharia screening methodology to meet the strict global expectations for sharia-compliance of listed stocks. The development of sukuk in Malaysia over the last two decades has transformed the Islamic financial landscape at the national and international levels, and has propelled governments and jurisdictions to accommodate Islamic finance business and transactions by reviewing their existing tax, sharia, and regulatory framework. An increasing number of multilateral developments institutions, governments, and multinational corporations are using and considering sukuk as an attractive source of funding. There is growing acceptance from sophisticated global investors of sukuk as a viable and competitive asset class. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Panama's GDP is projected to grow by 6.3% in 2016 according to the World Bank, making it the most dynamic economy in the region. What is driving this growth?</h4><p>Global economics are challenging now due to factors like the price of oil, the financial crisis, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the declining acquisition power of many countries that do not use the dollar. We are concentrated on the local region of Central American, the Caribbean, and parts of South America, which for many years have been the primary market for Panama's exports. Most countries in the region are still emerging economies. Latin America has been the emerging market of primary interest over the last few years. Consumption has decreased dramatically in the submerging markets of Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. In the context of trends in some regional economies, our roughly 6% growth in 2015 gives us great confidence.</p><h4>How has the industrial sector performed during 2015?</h4><p>The industrial sector is struggling in Panama. Our economic growth has been driven primarily by the service sector rather than industry. Our main asset leveraged for economic growth is the Canal, which creates opportunities for services like insurance, banking, and maritime services. We cannot change from a non-industrial country into an industrial country over the course of one year. The industrial sector is driven by our available natural resources. We do not have reserves in oil and gas, but we have copper and gold and we must work with what we have. Our main resource is our geographical value, which no other country can match. The global economy has to go through Panama. We are a logistics hub of historical importance with the Canal as well as one of the most modern airports in the western hemisphere.</p><h4>The CCIAP highlighted the 60% cumulative increase in the minimum wage in Panama between 2007 and 2015. Does such as large increase correspond to an increase in worker productivity?</h4><p>Our law stipulates that the minimum wage be revised every two years. The past administration took populist measures to gain popularity among voters. The law states that the private sector must meet with labor unions to collectively negotiate changes in the minimum wage. If they cannot agree on a revision, the elected government is to arbitrate a decision. Purchasing power has decreased as a result of a rise in consumer prices. The government increased the minimum salary by 15% in 2009, 2011, and again in 2013. These measures exacerbated the problem by driving up the cost of labor and production. The combined external and internal inflation reached a level of 4.5-5% across a period of two to three years. That created a lot of instability in the market, but inflation is now down to low levels, at a less than 1%.</p><h4>Why was Panama chosen as the regional hub for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)?</h4><p>This decision was a result of our geographical position. A lot of agricultural production comes from the rainforest, due to the conducive climate. Agriculture accounted for 25% of the country's GDP in 1950, while it currently contributes just 1.8%. The question becomes how to transform agriculture into a higher value added sector by utilizing new technology and incentives to drive down production costs. We have to establish a vision for the future of Panama's economy. Our main strength lies is in the services of port, cargo ship transport, and banking and insurance, which we have developed over the last century; agriculture will never be our primary driver. Another industry in which we need to invest resources is tourism. We have to advertise Panama abroad. We want to reach 3 million annual visitors by 2019. We received 1.7 million visitors in 2014 and that figure will reach nearly 2 million by the end of 2015. We will invest $100 million over the next three and a half years for tourism marketing across the world. We have the necessary hotel capacity. The Ritz-Carlton will join in 2016 the already broad list of renowned chains here, including Hilton and the W. Tourism has a lot of growth potential that will be unlocked in due time.</p><h4>What contribution does the construction sector make to growth?</h4><p>Growth in the construction sector will be high in the next few years. The sector grew impressively during the past three or four years due to the expansion of the Canal, but now construction investments are moving toward other infrastructure initiatives. From 2014 to 2015, construction growth overextended to 14%, but it is now plateauing and returned to around 7% this year. Contributions from the sector totaled $2.5 billion in 1H2015, so it still growing. We are building a second line of the metro, a $2 billion project that will span nearly 44 years, as well as renovating Colón City, a $600 thousand project. We are also bidding on a third metro line, which could reach a total value as high as $2.4 billion. We are bidding on another major infrastructure project to build a fourth bridge across the Canal. Two or three projects can have a lasting impact on economic growth and job creation. There is another investment opportunity to develop a project in water, wastewater, and sanitation.</p><h4>A number of important FTAs have been signed in the past year. Which industries will benefit most from an increase in trade with partner nations, and how will potential negatives be mitigated?</h4><p>The most complex FTA is the agreement with the US, under which import tariffs decrease gradually over the next 20 years. This will increase the global competitiveness of local sectors by allowing them to modernize. One of the benefits of FTAs is the access to global markets they provide to local companies across sectors. We can probably use these FTAs to take advantage of opportunities in industry, technology, and agriculture. Panama has a sizeable trade deficit. We spend about $980 million on Mexican imports, while we export only $20 million to the same country. Our imports from Peru exceed our exports by about $600 million. We really have to make an effort in certain sectors to be able to export products to different countries around the region, and FTAs help facilitate this.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>Expansion of the Canal will remain the primary focus in 2016. We expect to again be highest growing economy in Latin America, owing largely to the initiatives in developing infrastructure. We are still going to attract a lot of FDI. Compared to the tumultuous economies of most of our neighbors, Panama is a shining star among emerging markets, particularly in Latin America. We will continue leveraging the precious asset that is our strategic position.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Most GCC nations face the same challenge of balancing cultural heritage with rapid globalization. What do you believe are the foundations of Kuwaiti culture, both historically and today?</h4><p>Families have traditionally been the focus of Kuwaiti culture and that remains the case today. Multi-generational families share homes, celebrations, and the responsibility to continue Kuwait's history, traditions, and stories. What is interesting today is the growing role of grandparents outside the home. It is not unusual for grandparents to bring their grandchildren to participate in DAI cultural and educational programs held during working hours. This is an example of how Kuwaitis are adapting to fast-paced modernity without sacrificing the important role of the family or social and cultural heritage.</p><h4>How do you envision DAI building on its reputation of weaving education, enlightenment, and entertainment into the fabric of Kuwaiti cultural life?</h4><p>The DAI benefits from three key resources that allow us to deliver programs and merge education, enlightenment, and entertainment. We have the objects in the al-Sabah Collection, enthusiastic staff, and facilities. The objects in the al-Sabah Collection are tremendous tools for carrying out our vision. This is true for objects on loan to various museums, those included in DAI travelling exhibitions, and those on display in Kuwait. Objects in The al-Sabah Collection are or have been exhibited in leading cultural institutions around the world, including the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, the British Museum in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Louvre in Paris. Three DAI exhibitions, Islamic Art and Patronage: Treasures from Kuwait, Treasury of the World: Jeweled Arts of India in the Age of the Mughals, and al-Fann: Art from the Islamic Civilization, have literally travelled the world through showings in five of the seven continents. In addition, at any given moment hundreds of objects from the collection are on loan to prestigious museums in the US, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Here in Kuwait, the objects are exhibited in an historic building, which is open for free to the public. They offer inspiration to our staff and our audience as the objects are tangible examples of media, methods, and specialist techniques used by the artisans of the Islamic world since the advent of the religion. More important, the objects provide the threads of our story, which can be woven together by historians to expand our knowledge of the life and culture of the region, as well as by young children, who use their imagination to create fantastic tales grounded in an object or exhibition. Because of the commitment of everyone working with DAI, from the curator to our wonderful volunteers, we are able to create and deliver programs for individuals from the age of 18 months to 100 and older. Our cultural season includes lectures, concerts, films, workshops, children's activities, high school internships, and four docent recruitment and training sessions, none of which would be possible without a team that works hard to serve the community by bringing all these programs to fruition. While we are eagerly working toward the completion of the Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah at the Kuwait National Museum, we are using both the Amricani Cultural Centre (ACC) and the Yarmouk Cultural Centre (YCC) as resources for exhibitions, education programs, and cultural interaction. ACC includes both exhibitions of objects from The al-Sabah Collection and visiting exhibitions. Museum-based education programs are held there, as are special events throughout the season. YCC, our newest facility, is already busy with lectures, films, workshops, and concerts. Children's programs are held there two days a week, and the calendar is increasingly full of special events. In addition, the DAI library, currently housed in three different locations, will be integrated into one comprehensive library in space being developed specifically for that purpose in the YCC. Fieldwork is also an important aspect of DAI's program. The DAI has been actively involved in multi-national archaeological excavations in the Islamic world. This direct participation gives the organization the chance to share historic discoveries with our audience based on personal experience. It also supports further studies of the region's history and publications related to the findings.</p><h4>Education is one of the primary components of DAI's mission. What is the aim of the new children's library, and what are some other leading educational programs that you are focused on in Kuwait?</h4><p>The primary focus of all our education programs is cultural awareness, although it takes various forms depending on the audience. DAI programs strive to give participants the information and experiences they need to truly be a part of an increasingly global civilization. In addition to attending the evening lectures, educational opportunities that cannot be underestimated, and other cultural season events, adults completing the docent training course and working as a docent have an opportunity to be intimately involved in nearly all aspects of the DAI. They host guests in the museums, participate in special lectures and training sessions, and generally support the organization as needed. In effect, the docents are students and teachers, constantly learning more about the arts and culture of the region and sharing their knowledge with others. The children's libraries, which will open in both the ACC and YCC in January 2016, and all of the children's programs, are based on the “Four Cs" of collaboration, communication, creativity, and critical thinking, which are built into activities designed to promote cultural understanding and awareness. These programs are for children from 18 months through high school and, because of the multi-national backgrounds of the participants and the incorporation of the Four Cs in the programming, the children expand their knowledge not just of Islamic art and culture, but also the diverse arts and cultures of their classmates. </p><h4>The DAI launched its 21st Annual Cultural Season in September 2015. What growth have you seen in the DAI's Cultural Season over the years, and what are the main objectives and highlights of the 21st season?</h4><p>The primary objective of the Cultural Season programming has not changed since our first cultural season launched more than 20 years ago. Our purpose, then and now, is to provide individuals of all ages opportunities to discover more about the art and culture that surrounds them. What has changed is the volume and diversity of the participants and the activities included in our cultural seasons. This year's program includes 32 lectures, 16 classic films, 33 concerts, two theatrical weekends, eight Family Days, and five exhibitions. There will also be at least three book launches, two festivals, 124 children's education opportunities, five training sessions for volunteer docents, and many extra events that will be added during the season. There are always many surprises in our lectures and events, so predicting the highlights in advance is a guessing game. Highlights, like beauty, are in the eyes of the beholder. For some it will be a particular performance, for others a lecture, and for others an exhibition or children's program. This is one of the keys to our success.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges that the Islamic finance Industry needs to overcome in order to become a global instrument?</h4><p>In my opinion, the primary challenge of the Islamic finance industry is to attract a wider acceptance from both Muslim and non-Muslim countries. For an industry to go mainstream, we need more players. Raising awareness for Islamic finance is certainly a key focus area of the WIEF Foundation. For example, in London we organized a roundtable in 2012 and hosted the ninth WIEF in 2013. This accumulated effort has resulted in the UK's issuance of a £200 million ($280 million) sovereign sukuk in June 2014, and the orders for the issuance totaled $3 billion, making it nearly 12 times oversubscribed. In addition, the UK has also created an Islamic Index on the London Stock Exchange, launched the first Islamic insurance underwriting agency, developed the Islamic Insurance Association, set up sharia-compliant student and start-up loans, and established the Global Islamic Finance and Investment Group (GIFIG). We are happy with this progress, and would certainly like to emulate this effort in other markets. Another challenge is product innovation. There is an urgent need to create more instruments to serve the need of the 1.6 billion Muslims, as well as the growing demand of Islamic finance products from the non-Muslim communities. It is the Foundation's key mission to continuously engage the world's top Islamic experts to tackle this issue. Currently, Islamic banking assets account for 1% of conventional banking overall, whereas the Muslim population in the world is one in five. In addition, there are still large parts of the world the remains untapped, such as the US, South America, and China. This spells considerable room for growth. It is in this regard that we believe in the importance of the continued promotion and development of Islamic Finance on a sustainable basis.</p><h4>What needs to be done to realize the potential and the economies of scale for Halal food production?</h4><p>The halal food industry is projected to be worth $1,626 billion, and its growing demand is believed to be driven by expanding market, increasing disposable income, increasingly sophisticated consumers, focus of innovation and an increase of consumers outside of the Islamic faith who also seek for ethical food. To realize the full potential of the halal food industry, we certainly need to look into standardization efforts such as bringing together manufacturing and logistics companies in dedicated facilities to allow closer and more efficient supply chain integration, oversight and integrity, and developing state-of-the-art tracking and tracing systems for more effective farm to fork monitoring. </p><h4>What do you think about Malaysia as a destination for Halal travel and are there steps the country can take to win a larger share of the Halal travel market?</h4><p>Malaysia ranks number one in Crescentrating's top 10 Muslim-friendly travel destinations. Since 2000, the number of Muslim tourists to Malaysia increased from 1.3 million to 5.2 million in 2013. This makes up 20.33% of overall arrivals to Malaysia. Currently, there are 801 flights from Muslim countries flying to Malaysia. Strong air connectivity, with Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) emerging as one of the fastest growing airports in the world, has been instrumental in attracting foreign travellers. Malaysia is home to many halal restaurants, and our hotels and shopping malls often provide prayers facilities. The growth is highly optimistic. However, I personally do not think that there is a need to differentiate Halal tourism and tourism. If you are a Muslim you know that you can come here and that there are facilities for you, but we do not have to project ourselves for Halal tourism; we simply promote tourism per se, as we want to host people from the other parts of the world. If you to run your tourism offering specifically as a halal destination, you run the risk of alienating other potential visitors for whom that offering is not a primary consideration. Even Japan is working to cater to the Muslim market; it is still tourism, and not exclusively a Halal issue. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind Petra Group?</h4><p>We look at things that make a difference. I am a social capitalist. What we're about is making money, but in the process of that seeing if we can make a difference to society, and if we can improve things. I always look for businesses and ideas that can achieve such progress, whether they are in biotech, in industrial tech, or in our movie business. For me, it is just finding new innovations. We are all about strategic partnerships and we are very keen to work with other people. So it is not just about selling something, it is also about contributing to creating a more affluent society. I need to play a role in education, to help people move up, to make an impact on society. If everyone did something, imagine how things would change. Once you do that, you have earned all the bells and whistles. You have earned your money. </p><h4>Could you explain the nature of your movie business?</h4><p>The fastest growing area in Asia is entertainment and the delivery of entertainment. The challenge is how to entertain the new generation of Asians who are growing by double-digit percentages annually, and whose demand for instant gratification is higher, and how to also educate them through entertainment. We undertake the production of movies and are also aggressively looking into technologies that are related to the media. We have also been working on a number of TV series.</p><h4>The group, through its subsidiary Green Rubber Global, is engaged in recycling rubber. What social problem does this address?</h4><p>The world's number one environmental problem right now, believe it or not, is waste tires: we throw out 1.4 billion tires a year, which go into landfills, tire mountains, or are burnt for energy. Burning tires for energy is disastrous, releasing sulfur and toxins into the air. Yet if you bury tires, you contaminate the soil and the water table. As for tire mountains, they breed mosquitoes and hence are vectors for diseases like malaria or dengue fever. And if these piles catch fire, you cannot extinguish them. This is not talked about because it is not a product you can claim to want less of. The more development and wealth, the more cars, and the more cars, the more tires. So what we've come up with is a way to recycle it back into a compound that can then go back into tires, or shoes, or any rubber product. It is the world's only truly commercialized process for recycling rubber for tires. This is true recycling, and the recycled compound is cheaper than the original. It's one of those few products where nobody loses. I win, the manufacturer wins thanks to the lower cost, and the end user wins, too. We are opening a plant in the UK now, which PM David Cameron has recently announced, and also here in Malaysia and in the Middle East. We will export this recycled rubber all over the world. We want to expand into America, South America, and Southern Africa. Our aim is to make it the focus of a poverty eradication program that allows communities to recycle their waste. So the idea is to visit communities and teach them how to turn what is waste into green rubber. This will galvanize communities into considering the environment, while at the same time empowering them as they will be generating income in the process. In short, it is a good balance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the competitive advantages of KL as an investment destination as well as a location to set up regional headquarters?</h4><p>First of all these multinationals look not only at Malaysia and Greater Kuala Lumpur but the whole region. The tendency is for them to look at ASEAN because of the population, size, GDP, and economic indicators that are all positive in comparison to other geographies. Then they look at which location is suitable for them. There is a slight difference between the Greater Kuala Lumpur proposition and the Malaysian proposition. We are positioning Greater Kuala Lumpur as the location to set up regional headquarters for multinationals, whether they are in business services, engineering, finance, retail, supply chain or healthcare. Greater Kuala Lumpur offers the total package of having cost competitiveness and a thriving business ecosystem in addition to having a broader talent pool.</p><h4>How does InvestKL work with other government agencies to attract foreign investments here?</h4><p>We cooperate extensively with other government agencies. Malaysia is divided into different development corridors: the Northern Corridor, the East Coast Corridor, Iskandar, and then the corridors in Sabah and Sarawak. If a company is doing manufacturing in Penang, for example, the actual manufacturing will be in the free trade zone in Penang, but the headquarters can be located in Greater Kuala Lumpur. We are not competing; we are complimenting each other. All of the regional headquarters should be located in Greater Kuala Lumpur because this is the heart of Asia for business operations and naturally where the companies' intellectual property and key decision makers will reside. Greater Kuala Lumpur is the location for  centralising operations for these organizations, and ultimately when we engage with a multinational contact we will do it here.</p><h4>How will the infrastructure projects that are underway increase the attractiveness of KL both as a place to do business and as a place to live?</h4><p>There are two parts to that answer; first of all, you have to look at what business opportunities these projects present. There are many engineering companies that like what our government is doing and the business opportunities that are available to them. When companies know about the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) project and high-speed rail project and want to get involved, they will set up their regional headquarters here. The same company that worked on Dubai's Burj Khalifa has their regional headquarters here. From a quality of life standpoint, the biggest green project we have right now is the MRT project. Greater Kuala Lumpur is going to grow from a population of 6.5 million to 10 million, therefore without the infrastructure it will get very congested, and we will not be able to complete our vision of making Greater Kuala Lumpur into a modern and world-class city.</p><h4>What are the elements of the recently announced Principle Hub Initiative and how does this complement the work of InvestKL? </h4><p>The Principle Hub Initiative is a game changing initiative designed to make Greater Kuala Lumpur even more attractive to foreign investors. The Principle Hub is considered the control tower; where multinational companies set up strategic regional bases to conduct and manage their regional and global operations across several countries more effectively and efficiently. This initiative provides investors with attractive incentives to establish Principal Hub in Greater Kuala Lumpur for the region to streamline operations and better optimize resources, capabilities, and costs. At InvestKL, we can help investors to  align the incentives with the investments commitment. It is designed to attract even more substance from the multinationals coming into Greater Kuala Lumpur and further enhance our position as a regional headquarters, especially with Malaysia taking the ASEAN chair in 2015. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What do you identify as the key factors that make Malaysia an attractive destination for foreign investors?</h4><p>Firstly let us consider the ease of doing business in Malaysia. The infrastructure is well developed. We started with the manufacturing sector about 40-50 years ago, and over the years we have invested a lot in physical infrastructure such as ports, roads, and telecommunications because connectivity is very important. You need to have all this in place so that the companies that manufacture goods will have easy access to the markets from Malaysia. Number two is education in Malaysia. English is taught from standard one, so communication for international companies doing business in Malaysia is easy. You will not find any difficulty traveling anywhere in the country; people will understand you. Another is political stability—our government is a parliamentary democracy. The rule of law is based on British common law, so that is another great advantage. That is the base upon which this country is founded. The government has introduced many initiatives, such as the Economic Transformation Programme(ETP) and Government Transformation Programme (GTP). Even the collaboration between the government and the private sector makes the ease of business meaningful. The private sector and government work together and analyze what helps businesses to grow. Those are a few areas we can highlight. Of course, the location is also vital. The strategy in this region, with Malaysia chairing ASEAN 2015, is to move us to the next level. Within ASEAN, we are already a free trade area. Malaysia has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with many countries. The framework is already in place. Market access from Malaysia is easy with all this in place.</p><h4>To what do you attribute Malaysia's continued success?</h4><p>We want to continue to grow by strengthening the business environment, and improving the atmosphere for business. We are introducing new policies and fine-tuning old policies so that things will get better. Moving forward, to be competitive, we feel that we have to move up the value chain. Malaysia started as an agriculture-based economy, but over the years we have become more knowledge based with more R&amp;D activities in the manufacturing sector.</p><h4>What are you doing to boost domestic investments?</h4><p>Domestic and foreign investments co-exist. We are giving equal emphasis to both of them because we want to strengthen the eco-system, not only the supply chain but also the infrastructure, rules and regulations, trade agreements, investment agreements, and so forth. A strong supply chain is also important as you need to have strong domestic supporting industries for foreign investment to come. If they want to make goods, Malaysia has many supporting industries that can help them manufacture.</p><h4>How will increased integration between ASEAN nations make Malaysia and the region more attractive for investors?</h4><p>Over the years, we have been doing business with many countries. We have about 8,000 multinational or foreign companies doing business in Malaysia. We cannot be alone. That is why we need each other in ASEAN. Moving forward, I think Malaysia and the rest of ASEAN need to invest in each other to increase trade and linkages. The ecosystem is within Malaysia, but you can extend it to ASEAN to make it more vibrant and access more opportunities. If investors are already in Malaysia, they can invest in ASEAN, and vice versa. We have a lot of intra-ASEAN activities, so it will be more exciting. Each country has its own competitive advantage. ASEAN has its own competitive advantages as well. Businessmen will look for opportunities everywhere. If there is competition, that is good, but Malaysia has its own strengths and there are a lot of opportunities behind that strength. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>A well-functioning civil service is vital to achieving economic objectives and driving national development. What measures have been implemented to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government delivery services? </h4><p>Among the first measures that I have taken since assuming the role of Chief Secretary in 2012 was to introduce the concept of humanizing the public service, which is in line with the Malaysia “People First, Performance Now“ concept to create a people-oriented civil service. The concept is based on six guiding principles: openness; going down “on the ground“; engagement; striking a balance between spiritual and physical aspects; camaraderie or a sense of belonging; and collaboration and resource-sharing through Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and NGO partnerships. In addition, the efficiency and effectiveness of government services depends on both the hard aspects (facilities, technology, systems and procedures) and soft aspects (human capital) of service delivery. Therefore, it is critical to ensure that civil servants are appropriately remunerated, provided with good career prospects, and equipped with the necessary training to enable them to deliver services that meet and even exceed the expectations of citizens. Moving forward, the improvements in the civil service will focus on the initiatives identified in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan and on further enhancing the efficiency and productivity of the civil service. The citizen and the customer will be placed at the heart of service delivery with the emphasis on speedy execution through innovative and creative approaches, while upholding high standards of integrity. Malaysia's efforts in innovation have been recognized internationally. Furthermore, under the Malaysian Administrative Modernization and Management Planning Unit (MAMPU), we have developed various ICT initiatives as efforts to enhance public sector service delivery systems and to create a conducive environment for business when dealing with government agencies. MAMPU also continuously helps public sector agencies in revising and reengineering their business processes. As of March 31, 2015, the number of government online services available was 10,802, or 80.52%.</p><h4>What role will PPPs play in the Malaysian National Development Strategy (MyNDS)? </h4><p>The Malaysian Government has established a partnership with the private sector since the inception of the Malaysia Incorporated Policy in the early 1980s. This policy has succeeded in strengthening the partnership between the public and the private sectors in developing the nation. In line with MyNDS measures, PPPs emphasize the need for the private sector to be the front-runner as well as the engine of growth of the economy. The government has also demonstrated a high level of commitment in facilitating PPP initiatives that are open to new ideas and innovation put forward by the private sector. Infrastructure projects listed under the MyNDS, namely highways, will be implemented through PPPs. The Public Private Partnership Unit (UKAS) under the Prime Minister's Department is a dedicated agency to oversee PPP development, and is responsible for facilitating the process.</p><h4>What are your priorities between now and 2020, both as Chief Secretary and as Chairman of PEMUDAH? </h4><p>My priorities between now and 2020 include ensuring the public service successfully implements the policies, plans, and programs identified under the Eleventh Malaysia Plan in a smooth and timely manner, guided by the five philosophies of pro-growth, pro-people, pro-business, environment friendly, and an emphasis on nation building; effecting continuous improvement and transformation in the public service so as to have a lean, productive, talented, and competent public service that is able meet the people's needs and expectations through excellent service delivery. I want to create a civil service that is receptive, responsive, and emphatic to the needs of the rakyat in line with the concept of Humanizing the Public Service, while cutting down bureaucratic red-tape to make processes more efficient and effective, thus lowering costs and enhancing the people's experience when dealing with government services. Finally, I want to utilize NBOS when looking for solutions or coming up with programs to address current needs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In your view, what structural adjustments should be made to the Malaysian economy to ensure its resilience to a challenging external environment?</h4><p>We have diversified our economy over the years to ensure that we are not overly reliant on any one sector or economic activity. There was a time when Malaysia was predominantly dependent on the commodity and agriculture sectors. Yet over the years we have promoted and developed other non-commodity based and agricultural sectors of the economy, which today have become more dominant. For example, the services sector now makes up 55% of GDP, while the manufacturing sector makes up a further 25%. The construction sector contributes 4%, while mining and agriculture make up 8% and 7%, respectively. At the same time, we have also reduced our reliance on oil and gas revenues, which at one time accounted for over 40% of total government revenues. We have deliberately reduced this level to the point where it is now below the 30% mark. Having said that, we remain a net exporter of oil and gas. Therefore, with the current slump in oil and gas prices, total government revenues will decline. Thus, we need to make the necessary adjustments in terms of the 2015 budget. And this is exactly what we did on January 20th, 2015, when the Right Honorable Prime Minister announced measures to deal with the “new norm“ in terms of the lower prices of crude oil and gas, market volatility, and changing global circumstances.</p><h4>How would you assess the success of the 10th Malaysia Plan?</h4><p>We are essentially on track with the broader objectives of the plan, which is anchored on the New Economic Model (NEM). We have focused on three core components of NEM, namely high income, inclusiveness, and sustainability. With respect to high income, we have set a target of $15,000 gross national income (GNI) per capita to be achieved by 2020. Based on our progress to date, we have crossed the $10,000 level, and if we remain on track, we will be able to reach the target as early as 2018. In the case of inclusiveness, we want to make sure that as Malaysia achieves economic progress no one is left behind. This is approached from a number of perspectives. Firstly, we need to increase household income, and we have been able to do this through our efforts at improving productivity and introducing a minimum wage framework. For sustainability, it is not just a question of how we treat the environment or manage our natural resources, but also involves effective management of government finances. In managing Malaysia's natural resources, as much as we are blessed with oil and gas, we need to ensure that we are extracting less than the new reserves being discovered. We are happy that we have been able to maintain our oil reserves that can last us for a further 28 years and gas reserves that can last us for another 42 years. In terms of managing government finances, we realized that, during a crisis, there was a need for the government to prime the economy, which resulted in a much higher deficit of 6.7% of GDP in 2009. Such deficits are unsustainable, whereupon we embarked on a fiscal consolidation program. We are now working to achieve a balanced budget by 2020. We have consistently reduced the deficit over time, and in 2012 we reduced it to 4.5%. In 2013 it was at 3.9%, and in 2014 it was further reduced to 3.5%. This year we had targeted a reduction in fiscal deficit to 3%, but given low oil prices, we have since revised that target to 3.2%. As part of managing government finances, one of the key measures is the introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), effective April 1 of this year. This will broaden our revenue base significantly. Although net income to be generated for this year will be approximately $228.15 million, there are other indirect benefits to GST such as enhanced tax compliance, which will further boost government revenues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia is playing an increasingly important role on the global stage, as evidenced by its chairmanship of ASEAN in 2015 and its presence on the UN Security Council. How can Malaysia leverage this to advance domestic trade and industry objectives? </h4><p>Malaysia's domestic trade and industry objectives are streamlined with regional and international developments. We believe that this is the best way to enhance our overall economic competitiveness. Market and business friendly policies have always been the core of Malaysia's foreign trade policy. Our increasingly important global role and involvement in major FTAs give us a better market access, which in turn contributes toward sustaining the country's economic growth and development. Today, Malaysian micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) are penetrating regional and global markets. We now have more than 1,000 Malaysian enterprises doing business in ASEAN, and many of them also have a presence in other key markets such as China and India.</p><h4>Negotiations are underway to establish FTAs between Malaysia and other regions outside ASEAN, such as China, India, and the EU. What new opportunities and challenges will this present for Malaysian manufacturers? </h4><p>As a trading nation with a comparatively small domestic market of 30 million people, it is imperative for Malaysia to continue adopting an open trade and investment regime to promote economic growth, provide opportunities for high skilled employment, and technology transfer. Beyond ASEAN, we are currently in negotiations for two major FTAs namely the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which will provide a market of 800 million people and a combined GDP of $2.75 trillion, as well as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which consists of 16 countries with a market of more than 3 billion people. These FTAs will enhance Malaysia's attractiveness as a preferred investment destination and high value-added manufacturing hub. </p><h4>What current initiatives are underway to establish Malaysia as an international hub for Halal products and services? </h4><p>Malaysia's halal industry has been growing consistently over the past few years. As of 2014, total exports of halal products stood at $8.65 billion while 206,000 jobs were created in this industry. As Malaysia strives to be the leading global hub for halal products and services, we are ramping up our efforts to stay ahead of others by offering a complete halal ecosystem. Instead of focusing only on halal products and services, we also provide other halal-related support services including Islamic finance and banking, takaful, logistics, and tourism. <br>At the same time, we never lose sight of the importance of developing the capacity and capability of our local halal companies. The Halal Business Transformation program was introduced in 2011 where various initiatives have been carried out such as equipping the workforce with the right knowledge and skills, providing advisory services, and facilitating financial applications, as well as establishing business linkages between local companies and other multinational players. To date, there are close to 1,700 companies, which have generated total sales of $340 million, that have been participating in this program.</p><h4>What is your outlook for 2016? </h4><p>As of June 2015, there are 156 projects in the pipeline with investments worth $3.37 billion for the manufacturing and services sectors. These projects are mainly in E&amp;E, chemicals and advanced materials, transport technology, healthcare, education, hospitality, and food manufacturing. Moving forward, MITI will continue to ramp up promotional activities to attract quality investment projects with high technology and high value-added features that have strong linkages with domestic industries. Furthermore, we are set to officially announce the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) in November of this year. The AEC seeks to establish a single market and production base in this region of more than 620 million people with a combined GDP of $2.57 trillion. This regional economic integration will offer abundant opportunities for foreign investors from outside ASEAN.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia is chairing ASEAN for 2015. What are Malaysia's unique qualities that have made it a strong chairman and allowed it to develop ASEAN? </h4><p>Malaysia assumed its chairmanship of ASEAN at a challenging phase of the ASEAN's community-building and integration process. This year marks the end of the period for implementation of the 2009-2015 action plans contained in the three blueprints for the political-security, economic, and socio-culture communities. In the remaining months of 2015, ASEAN has been accelerating efforts to realize the ASEAN Community and at the same time crafting its post-2015 vision. This year indeed has been instrumental in deciding the success of the ASEAN Community building process and in charting the future direction of the ASEAN Community. As ASEAN Chair at this critical juncture, Malaysia with its vast experience and the strong support and dedication of its leadership has contributed to the enhancement of ASEAN unity and solidarity helping ASEAN maintain its centrality through the implementation of important initiatives such as those addressing the issues or the irregular movement of people, radicalization and violent extremism, the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the development of SMEs, the strengthening of ASEAN institutions and the promotion of ASEAN as a people-oriented and people-centered community. Malaysia's successful chairmanship of ASEAN this year is laying a solid foundation for ASEAN's further progress in the process of community consolidation and comprehensive integration beyond 2015.</p><h4>How would you summarize the trade benefits that this economic bloc has to offer its AMS?</h4><p>The AEC will increase the opportunities for ASEAN Member States in the form of an increasingly well-regulated, dynamic, and creative platform for trade and commerce. The community is comprised of some of the world's most dynamic economies, and amid the diversity, lies complementary strengths and potential. As a region, ASEAN has become more influential, with widening markets regionally and globally. It is Asia's third largest economy and the world's seventh largest. With a combined population of 625 million, ASEAN has a vast consumer base, behind only China and India. ASEAN is also among the most advanced integrated markets with intra-ASEAN trade comprising the largest share of its total trade that amounted to $2.53 trillion in 2014. One of AEC's pillars is the establishment of a single market and production base. Toward this end, significant progress on tariff liberalization has been made across the region with intra-ASEAN import tariffs virtually eliminated and formal restrictions in services sector gradually removed providing ASEAN Member States with greater market opening and economies of scales in trading and doing business within the region. Member States will also benefit from improved efficiency from lower transaction costs and better business certainty with simplifications of cross-border trading processes, including customs procedures and rules of origin, harmonization of technical regulations and mutual recognition arrangements. The AEC has also led to the creation of a business-friendly and innovation-supporting regional environment through the adoption of common frameworks, standards and mutual cooperation across various areas such as agriculture and financial services, competition policy, intellectual property rights, and consumer protection. It also supports improvements in transport connectivity and other infrastructure networks that have facilitated cross-border transportation and contributed to reducing overall costs of doing business, while providing ASEAN's people and businesses with better opportunities to work together in a more productive manner. Finally, the coherent approach pursued by ASEAN in its external economic relations in an effort to fully integrate to the global economy will provide ASEAN member states with opportunities to expand their reach in the markets to strategic partner countries, and enhance their participation in global supply networks. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>There is a growing Belgian business community in Malaysia. What attracts these companies to set up regional offices here, and what opportunities does the Malaysian market present? </h4><p>There are currently approximately 385 Belgian companies registered in Malaysia and we hope to reach the cap of 400 this year. The overall majority of the Belgian community resides in Malaysia for business reasons. Different assets of the country attract them. First, Malaysia has a unique geographical location: centrally positioned in South-East Asia, the country is an ideal hub for the ASEAN region as well as the Far East. The Strait of Malacca is a vital artery for the world's international trade. Malaysia boasts an open economy, which attracts many foreign investors, including Belgians. Moreover, the country is also an important producer of commodities, notably palm oil and crude oil and gas. These two commodities have given rise to a strong petrochemical and oleochemical sector in Malaysia, in which our Belgian companies actively participate. Last but not least, Malaysia is a country where all these business strengths are combined with a good quality of life. Malaysia prides itself in being a moderate country with good living standards, two key factors for attracting foreign talent and businesses. If the country upholds the essential values of tolerance and moderation, future foreign investments will be secured. </p><h4>Negotiations are underway to establish an FTA between Malaysia and the European Union. How soon do you think such an FTA could be finalized?  </h4><p>The importance of the European Union for Malaysia can hardly be underestimated. Today, the EU is Malaysia's fourth largest trading partner, the second largest trading partner for ASEAN and by far the largest source of FDI into the ASEAN region. With 500 million consumers, it is the largest single market in the world economy, where imported goods can circulate freely. Malaysia could boost its trade with the EU and Belgium even more once the FTA is concluded. The European Commission and the EU Delegation to Malaysia are currently working together with Malaysia to restart the negotiations. It is difficult to predict when these negotiations will be finalized, but this timeline is not the primary concern. What is most important is that the FTA becomes an ambitious, all-encompassing agreement that tackles all existing trade barriers, so that it benefits both our populations. Belgium strongly supports the increasing role that the EU is taking in Malaysia, because its identity is very much linked to that of Europe: we are one of the founding fathers of the EU and Brussels, which is home to more than 160 nationalities, is considered the de facto capital of the Union. In that sense, we could draw a parallel with Malaysia's famous slogan and say: “Belgium, Truly Europe.“ </p><h4>How will increased integration between ASEAN nations further boost the importance of Malaysia as a gateway to the rest of Southeast Asia? </h4><p>With a market of 600 million consumers and average annual GDP growth of 6% over the past 15 years, ASEAN has become a global economic player to reckon with. Today, ASEAN represents a $2.5 trillion economy. Once the ASEAN Economic Community is completed, by the end of 2015, the region will be the third largest single market in the world. And with these increasing powers come increasing responsibilities: as the ASEAN Chair in 2015, Malaysia will guide ASEAN during an important year in the history of the Association. Belgium supports ASEAN's efforts in establishing a full-fledged ASEAN Community, which will enhance political, economic, and socio-cultural integration amongst its members. By continuing to promote its business friendly environment at the center of South-East Asia, Malaysia will continue to serve as a gateway to ASEAN for European and Belgian companies.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Malaysia and the Netherlands have a history of strong bilateral relations. How have these evolved in recent years, and what makes Malaysia an important political, economic and security partner for the Netherlands today? </h4><p>The relationship between the Netherlands and Malaysia goes back a long way. In 1957, the Netherlands was one of the first countries to establish relations with Malaysia following its independence, and we have enjoyed excellent ties ever since. Trade and investment relations have developed particularly well over the past few decades as our economies have grown. The Netherlands is Malaysia's second export destination, and is currently the second trade and investment partner in South East Asia. Despite the geographical distance between us, Malaysia and the Netherlands have various similarities. Both countries are multicultural and multi-religious, and, despite being relatively small, are among the world's leading trading nations. I am pleased that our shared interests have allowed for the flourishing of our bilateral relationship in recent years. Since the MH17 tragedy, we have grown closer as grieving nations. During my visit in November 2014 and during my recent meeting with Najib Razak at the Bo'ao Forum in China, I underlined our strong bilateral ties, our long-term economic and trade relations and the importance of our cooperation in the aftermath of the MH17 tragedy.</p><h4>There is a strong Dutch business community in Malaysia, with many Dutch multinational companies having set up regional offices here. What are the advantages of Malaysia as a destination for Dutch investors?</h4><p>Quite a number of Dutch multinational companies have located their regional offices in Malaysia because of its excellent business climate. More than 200 Dutch small- and medium-sized enterprises are also active in the country. I believe that Malaysia's ambition to transform into an innovation-based economy and the identification of several National Key Economic Areas make Malaysia a “Hub into Asia" for key Dutch sectors such as chemicals, energy, logistics, agriculture and food, and horticulture. During my visit to Kuala Lumpur in November 2014, I had a fruitful meeting with members of the Malaysia Dutch Business Council, who are active in promoting trade and investments between Malaysia and the Netherlands. When I asked them what was needed to improve the business climate in Malaysia even further, the MDBC had to point out that Malaysia already outperforms the Netherlands on the World Bank Doing Business Indicators. Malaysia was ranked sixth in 2014 and provides the facilities that Dutch companies need to deliver high-quality goods and services. Furthermore, the workforce is educated and multilingual and the country has well developed infrastructure, including excellent roads and a strategically located, well-connected airport and harbors. Business costs, such as rent, salaries, and corporation tax, are relatively low. Since the ASEAN economies are generally doing very well, Malaysia is also an attractive base for Dutch companies' operations in the region. Another important pull factor is Malaysia's central location within six to eight hours' flying time of key regional financial service hubs like Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai, Dubai, and Sydney. Finally, Malaysia offers several effective incentive programs to attract foreign investors. </p><h4>Negotiations are currently underway for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Malaysia and the EU. How soon do you think an FTA could be finalized and how would this reinforce Malaysia's position as the Netherlands' main ASEAN trading partner?</h4><p>Malaysia is the EU's second largest trading partner in ASEAN, and the second country with which the EU opened negotiations on an FTA. Progress has been made since negotiations resumed in 2014; however, there is still some ground to be covered. I am confident that we will reach an agreement that is satisfactory to all parties involved. The FTA will create opportunities for economic growth, both in Malaysia and the Netherlands in sectors such as agriculture, services and investment. Malaysia is also the Netherlands' second largest trading partner in ASEAN. An FTA would further reinforce our already strong ties. </p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Malaysia an important diplomatic, economic and security partner for New Zealand?</h4><p>Malaysia is an important partner for New Zealand for a number of reasons. In economic terms, Malaysia is our eighth largest trading partner overall, and our second largest within ASEAN. And in terms of security, Malaysia is one of our closest defense partners in the region, a relationship that is underpinned by our longstanding cooperation on defense and security issues. We are both members of the Five Power Defense Arrangement, which is the cornerstone of New Zealand's defense and security engagement in the region. As our shared term on the Security Council gets under way, New Zealand will be working closely with Malaysia as fellow non-permanent members to represent the interests and concerns of the Asia-Pacific region. In addition, our close economic ties have fostered strong people-to-people links in many areas. Many New Zealand universities have agreements with Malaysian education providers, with around 2,000 Malaysian students currently studying in New Zealand.</p><h4>What has the effect of the Malaysia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (MNZFTA)?</h4><p>MNZFTA is central to our trade relationship with Malaysia, and builds on the twelve-country Agreement establishing the ASEAN-Australian-New Zealand Free Trade Area (AANZFTA), which entered into force in January of the same year. For the year-ending 2014, Malaysia was New Zealand's sixth largest merchandise goods trading partner, moving up from 10th place before the Agreement coming into force. Total merchandise goods trade was worth NZ$3.3 billion for the year ending 2014, which represents an increase of NZ$1.5 billion over the past five years. And it is not just merchandise goods trade that has expanded under the MNZFTA. Services exports to Malaysia have also grown since 2010 in a range of high value sectors, such as private education, engineering and IT. Meanwhile, officials from both our countries continue to work closely together to ensure that the FTA responds to the interests of our businesses, and reflects developments in modern trade. For example, Malaysia and New Zealand negotiated an amendment to the Agreement to provide for more modern international invoicing practices. With a growing population of close to 30 million, more trade with Malaysia represents an excellent opportunity for New Zealand. MNZFTA not only enables us to deepen our ties with Malaysia, but also provides New Zealand a foothold in South-East Asia. </p><h4>How will closer regional integration impact the importance of ASEAN for New Zealand?</h4><p>New Zealand strongly supports ASEAN's regional integration ambitions, including its steps towards its Economic Community. It is well known that global and regional integration can result in significant economic and social benefits, and the AEC has the potential to deliver these benefits to ASEAN and the wider region, including New Zealand. New Zealand's relationship with ASEAN was further strengthened by the signing of the AANZFTA in 2009. This year marks New Zealand's 40th anniversary of engagement with ASEAN. If we consider ASEAN as a group, it is already New Zealand's fourth largest trading partner, and our second fastest growing trading relationship among our top ten partners—and this is just the beginning. Through the AEC, ASEAN's economy has the potential to continue developing and become an even more important, open and integrated force in the global economy. We want to work alongside ASEAN to support its integration ambitions and together make the Asia-Pacific a prosperous and leading region. </p><h4>What do you envisage for the future of bilateral relations between New Zealand and Malaysia?</h4><p>We will continue to strengthen our relationship with Malaysia by further implementing the MNZFTA, creating more opportunities for our businesses; enhancing our people to people links—especially through education and tourism; continuing to build on the strong ties between our defense forces; and increasing our engagement in security issues of mutual concern, including in the context of our shared term on the United Nations Security Council. New Zealand will also work closely with Malaysia and our other regional partners to support the development of an ASEAN Economic Community.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Now is the Time]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[now-is-the-time]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>For the past few months, markets and economies across the globe have come under significant pressure due to a convergence of factors, concerns over commodity prices, fragile growth prospects in some of the world's largest economies, as well as recurring geopolitical tensions. These have seen cross currency, equity and bond markets as well as emerging economies facing some of the most challenging conditions since the 2008 financial crisis. Even though we stand at cross-border inter-linkages, both in real and financial sectors, it is of little surprise that a relatively small opening economy, such as Malaysia, would be exposed to some degree of this volatility. Nevertheless, it is this connectivity that has also enabled us to benefit from a range of trade, investment, and capital flotation. We would do well to remember that there will be long-term gains from Malaysia's integration into the global economy, at the cost of this short-term dislocation. It is essential for policy makers to steady our resolve and steer a course to pursue greater liberalization and openness through the international community. We know the implications of this—more integration and openness to the global economy. This is why we have strengthened our resilience against potential sources of contagion. We translated the lessons we learned from previous crises into an effective and meaningful response to the current market trends and developments. We have initiated measures and actions, including the establishment of a Special Economic Committee chaired by Nazir Razak. The Committee first met recently, and discussed immediate and medium-term plans of action to further strengthen Malaysia's economic position. I am confident that the collective wisdom and experience of committee members and others will provide sounds and pragmatic recommendations to ensure that our economy remains on course. </p><p>Compared to where we were prior to the 1997 and 1980 crises, Malaysia is now in a far stronger position to weather any incoming storms. Over the last 50 years, we undertook important structural reforms in our financial and banking system. These include the introduction of internationally benchmarked regulatory frameworks and rigorous supervisory regimes. We strengthened our potential requirements for market participants, enacted extensive corporate governance reforms, and the fiscal revenue base of the government has been further strengthened with the introduction of the GST. Our local currency bond market, at MYR1.1 trillion, is the third largest in Asia. The development of this market has significantly broadened our financial system. The bond market has also reduced our reliance on short-term foreign currency denominated borrowings, as was the case during the Asian crisis. The differences between 1998 and 2015 do not end there: today the equity market is worth MYR1.5 trillion, compared to MYR175 billion, and with much stronger corporate balance sheets, and that is the government listed companies. The institutionalization of the buy side anchored by Malaysia's key domestic investor base coupled with a high ceiling price serve as a source of long-term funds for the capital market. Our stock markets now operate in a more structured and regulated way as well. These structural reforms have collectively strengthened the ability of the Malaysian financial system to weather bouts of intense volatility and effect adjustments in an orderly manner. During the recent financial global crisis, for example, our capital market and banking system continued to function without disruptions or failures. This resilience has enabled our financial system to fulfill, without interruption, its most important function, serving as a source of long-term financing to compliment the banking sector. The Malaysian capital market has provided MYR376 billion through IPOs and bond issuances since 2012. This has resulted in capital formation and job creation in sectors that include infrastructure, communications, and agriculture, with gross fixed capital formation reaching from between 26 to 27% of GDP over that same period. The convergence of these efforts with favorable macro-economic conditions has enabled Malaysia to record more than 20 years of robust economic growth. Despite lingering perceptions of Malaysia being reliant on mining, principally oil and gas related commodities, our economy has diversified to the extent that services manufacturing and construction sectors now account for more than two thirds of our economy. At the same time, from the export intensive model, we have successfully rebalanced our economy, with growth now largely driven by private sector lending and domestic demand. Due to our reforms and transformation programs, the foundation of our economy is stronger, and we are on track to achieve our goal of becoming a high-income state nation by 2020. <br>While I am confident of the strength and robustness of our financial system, we cannot take the current situation for granted and rest on our laurels. Energy and commodity prices are no longer what they used to be, the world's second largest economy is showing signs of slowing down and global liquidity maybe drying up. This is critical, and is why we are opening up regionally. Regional integration is one of our core priorities. As one of the founding members of ASEAN and its current chair, Malaysia is firmly convinced of the value of a single market and production base, which allows all 10 members to benefit from seamless intra-regional flow of goods, services, and capital. Furthermore, an economically strong ASEAN would have the ability to generate its own internal growth parameter. It could finance its own growth using its own capital, and do not forget, if we can increase intra-ASEAN trade, then our vision will be quite safe. And, of course, we will reduce our vulnerability to external fluctuations as well. As we approach the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community by the end of 2015, I am pleased to note that regional integration in on course, with the private sector increasingly taking a more active role in unlocking the tremendous promise that the region offers. Integration efforts in the financial sector in particular, have made good progress, as we have seen with the emergence of financial service providers with a truly regional footprint. I was informed that the ASEAN Capital Market Forum met yesterday, Chaired by our Securities Commission, and comprised of regulators from all member countries. I am pleased that they finalized the post-2015 vision for an  interconnected ASEAN Capital Market enabling ASEAN's vast pools of capital to be aggregated and mobilized into financing the region's development. Malaysia has implemented a series of reforms to strengthen the business environment, with particular emphasis on encouraging business formation, and I am pleased to say that the Securities Commission is playing its part. The commission has taken steps to extend excess capital market financing for smaller businesses through the estblishment of the equity crowdfunding (ECF), and introduction of the SME investment partner's program in collaboration with SME Corporation. Looking further afield, the Securities Commission has identified a new high potential sector: technology as a new growth sector in the world's economy. FinTec covers a broad range of financial technology from trading software, to market data, exchange technology, analytics, cloud computing, high-speed networking, and mobile technology. It is clear that this sector deserves our concerted support, and I am pleased to announce the establishment of the Alliance of FinTech Community, or aFINity@SC, which will set up a network of new stakeholders in the field. This network seeks to connect FinTech entrepreneurs with investors, researchers, mentors, as well as with relevant government agencies in order to raise awareness of the opportunities in the sector. The network will also capitalize on business formation and development by establishing hubs to nurture a burgeoning FinTech ecosystem to provide a regulatory environment responsible financial integration and I am supporting the Malaysian Securities Commission in this mission.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[Milling About]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[milling-about]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>FMN has been a key player in the agricultural industry and food processing for many years; what trends have driven the company's growth over the past five to 10 years?<br></h4><p>Our core business is food, and we started wheat milling over 50 years ago. We started with one mill producing 500 metric tons per day. Today our capacity has grown to 10,000 metric tons per day and we can confidently say that we are one of the biggest flour milling operations in this part of the world. Over the decades we have diversified, and rather than limiting ourselves to the production of flour for the bread baking and confectionary industries. In 1972, we established the first plant for producing pasta in Nigeria. Today, we have become the biggest pasta manufacturing company in Africa. FMN has further diversified in the recent past into the production of noodles, snacks, and breakfast cereals that primarily use locally sourced ingredients. Currently, we are also the largest agro-allied company in the country. Our strategy is to develop value chains, particularly with crops where we have a comparative advantage in Nigeria. We aggregate corn in this country from local farms and process it into animal feed and have developed our animal feed business to become the biggest in Sub-Saharan Africa. We have an animal feed procession plants in Ibadan, Sapele, and Calabar with a combined output of 700,000 metric tons per annum, making it the largest in Sub-Sahara Africa. As we produce animal feed, we are also keen to develop our poultry operation as well. In addition we have a sugar refinery in Lagos, which has a refining capacity of 750,000 tons per annum and due to the National Master Plan we have developed sugar estates, vegetable oil and margarine processing facility by ROM Oil, a FMN subsidiary company. Our strategy is to ensure that we strengthen our core food business through diversification of our business by going downstream and also supporting our business through the agro-allied businesses by expanding the value chains that will help to sustain and develop local content.</p><h4>Earlier this year you sold your cement business to Lafarge, what drove that decision?</h4><p>In order for us concentrate or expand our two portfolios in the food business and in the agro-allied business, we decided to divest from cement, where we are just partial players. Formerly we had held around a 30% stake in UNICEM from Calabar Cement and Lafarge and Holcim were holding the balance of 70% and, from the moment they merged in 2014, we were at a terrible disadvantage, and it was natural that we would then divest and concentrate on our core business.</p><h4>How would you characterize your performance and the health of the sector for the first half of 2015?</h4><p>Most of the bottom line profit came from the sale of our cement operations. Otherwise it was a tough year. There was the issue of irregular gas supply, intense gridlock in Apapa due to a tanker driver's strikes, and the naira devaluation. We depend on imports, so that was wiping out our bottom line. Also the entire north-east of Nigeria, basically the three states of Yobe, Borno, and Adamawa were totally cut off because of the insurgency activities and so on, people were displaced, and so the market all but collapsed in those places. So with these issues it was obvious that we could not maintain our top line or grow. We should be commended for any result that we got, because under similar circumstances, many companies would have been wiped out.</p><h4>How was FMN affected by the Forex restrictions on imports recently issued by the Central Bank?</h4><p>I support the decision, especially for the restrictions on rice, which we should be producing here ourselves. However, I think the Central Bank should be very clear and let us know what the monetary policy is with regard to foreign exchange and help the businesses, manufacturing, industry, and investors to know exactly where they belong. Otherwise, if we do not have consistency, we do not have confidence in the direction that the monetary policy will go, and it will be difficult to plan and hard for investors to enter the market.</p><h4>You recently announced that Flour Mills would seek to raise capital; what would be your preferred method of access to capital and where would the funds be invested?</h4><p>We are highly leveraged, because of the investments that we have made, especially in the agro-allied space in the last five years, and it has really raised our debt profile. We are under the weight of high interest payments and that is what we plan to address. In order to do that we have to source our funds from areas other than banks, and that is why we are planning a rights issue. The rights issue will give opportunities for our shareholders to support the company and help the company lower its debt profile. That will also confirm the confidence of shareholders in the company, who know that the company is undervalued in the stock market and this is the time to take advantage.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p><span></span>Our expectations are high, and we hope to know what the policy direction of the new government is very soon. The government creates the environment for business, and once that is established, it will be easier for us to plan the next five and 10 years. We also need to know what the monetary policies of the government are, because at this point in time we are borrowing at 18%. The most critical point is infrastructure. The government needs to focus on this. The government needs to ensure that the power sector improves. Roads are another issue. Our company is repairing the roads outside of our plant, for example. You cannot develop agriculture sufficiently if there is no water management or irrigation infrastructure. We need skill development, and human capacity building is important. We cannot depend on expatriates to run our businesses forever, even family businesses. We need to look at education that is targeted for special purpose, not just going to university, but targeted education with skill sets that are required for the growth of our economy. Once we have these clear views from government, it is easy for us to really plan. We are going to focus on our food business and our agri allied businesses as we move forward, even as we move abroad to the continent. Once government continues to examine the economy and people are gainfully employed, and disposable income is improving, you will see the country and investments continue to grow.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Carrier in Mexico and what has changed since you have been here?</h4><p>Carrier has a long history in Mexico since it began in 1930. The company began operations by working together with a family based in Monterrey and established a large manufacturing facility. Mexico was one of the first markets it explored outside of the US. Carrier is the inventor of the first air conditioning, and also innovated by introducing a print process to the design, which allows you to control temperature and humidity. Carrier established a manufacturing point in Monterrey, which is now based in five manufacturing locations with about 2,000 employees. This is the second largest manufacturing center in terms of concentration and capacity after China. These factories serve the American, Canadian, and Latin American markets with the exception of Brazil and Argentina. Carrier came to Mexico because of labor costs and its geographic location, but it came before the automotive industry and now the automotive industry is following this path into Monterrey.</p><h4>Is the increase in competition the biggest change you have seen over recent years?</h4><p>This is one of the biggest changes we have seen. If you look at demand and the products that are on offer then you see that consumers have a much greater range of options to select from when making a decision on buying. Products and quality of service are the only areas where you can compete for loyalty. Consumers are much better educated today, through technology, social networking, and the boom in e-commerce. We just launched our first e-commerce site, where we are serving our customers in a different way. Carrier now has a 24/7 store where we are always available. This is a huge change for the market, especially for our industry, which is related to steel and compressors rather than electronic innovation. Carrier has come out with online sale services and you can make a comparison or buy our products on your cellphone.</p><h4>How do you maintain customer loyalty?</h4><p>We do this in many ways. We carry out a lot of training and education programs, and try to maintain awareness among our customers in a consistent way. The customer profile today is different for a single woman, for a family, or for a couple that wants to have a beach house, so trends and customer demands are changing, and you need to have a product and strategy that is applicable for everyone. Our marketing slogan today is “Be Happy," and with this we are trying to explain to people that air conditioning can help you to be happy and productive in a workplace or school.</p><h4>How much of your business is residential and how much is commercial?</h4><p>The residential side is almost always the largest, and it depends on the economic capacity of the population. Trends in demographics, for example families living together for longer in the US, affect the market, as young people do not move out as early. Such tendencies can be found in any market, and must be taken into consideration.</p><h4>Are the automotive and aerospace sectors important for you in terms of customers?</h4><p>The automotive manufacturing sector has become strategic in Mexico because of the extensive production and supplies chain it involves, in what you call tier 1, 2 and 3 companies. Everything is a process around them and we do very well with the big automotive companies who recommend us to their suppliers, so there is a referral process within the automotive and aerospace sectors. There are a lot of electronic companies establishing in the North of Mexico and UTC has a new aerospace plant in Mexicali, which we are serving.</p><h4>Sustainability is an issue for consumers, and air conditioning has a reputation for not being environmentally friendly. How does Carrier address this?</h4><p>Our logos have a green leaf symbol, which shows the efforts we are making with regard to sustainability. Carrier became a founder of a movement that is trying to develop the most adequate ways of designing and building sustainable structures. That is how we have managed to win LEED certification for our buildings. We are always innovating in our use of refrigerants and the chemicals that regulate heat exchange with the air. These refrigerants have global warming and polluting effects on the atmosphere, so Carrier is always looking to find a balance. There has been a lot of work done on developing new compressor technology, the components that lie at the heart of air conditioning systems.</p><h4>Why was the LEED certification obtained by your facility important for the company?</h4><p>We work with consultants, architects, and owners and people that have to provide value in terms of their engineering products and services. LEED certification applies to buildings and facilities, but also to workers. Every sales engineer we hire goes through a process of training to become an AP certified engineer. New professionals especially seek this certification and look for ways to work in a more sustainable way. Air conditioning is an important element of this, as these systems use a lot of energy. Carrier is a pioneering company in this area, and we try to improve awareness of LEED certification in the market.</p><h4>Do you have any flagship projects here in Mexico?</h4><p>Most of our main projects are in areas such as entertainment, shopping malls, retail and department stores, manufacturing, office buildings, and cooling processes, where we are successfully serving our clients. We are also working at the Museo Papolote, which is undergoing remodeling work and will be enlarged. We are working with the Koreans in the automotive manufacturing industry in Monterrey, and this is also a huge investment. We are working on a number of buildings around the Santa Fe area also.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>When did Yobel decide to come to Ecuador, and why?</h4><p>Yobel came to Ecuador 45 years ago, and from the outset, our goal has been to be a regional player with the support of our partners. Our strategy has been developed with BELCORP, a strategic business ally. We offer outsourcing in supply chain management in 13 countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and the US. We first came to Ecuador because one of our partners wanted us to drive their expansion. Our first services in Ecuador included warehouse and door-to-door distribution, and 13 years ago we began offering direct sales services.</p><h4>What services does Yobel currently offer?</h4><p>The company has gradually expanded to include commercial activities of the sector. Our top priority is to support the expansion and growth of our customers through the services we provide: distribution, warehousing, goods monitoring, assembly and packaging and promotion. Currently, Yobel works with 12 companies in Quito and Guayaquil.</p><h4>What are the largest companies working with Yobel?</h4><p>All the companies we work with are integral to our business, as they have each taught us lessons about the local market. We lead the assembly and packaging activity for Colgate and Pronaca, and we distribute for Nestle and Kimberly-Clark. We support these latter two customers with warehousing services in Quito and Guayaquil. We provide warehousing for 4life, and are currently in discussions to launch a partnership with Cerveceria Nacional, which would represent an important step forward for our business volume. We also work with Calzacuero supplying warehousing and distribution. It is standard for customers to come and go, but these customers represent our main focus and activity.</p><h4>In your opinion, which economic sector offers the greatest opportunities for Yobel to consolidate its activities?</h4><p>For a developing country, BELCORP offers considerable potential in terms of volume. In this context, we are interested in working with high-volume mass consumption companies such as Unilever. We would also like to expand our partnership with Kimberly-Clark. In terms of food and beverages, we are nearing the closure of a deal with what we believe to be the largest, most attractive partner we could work with, Cerveceria Nacional.</p><h4>How would you describe the supply chain management of Yobel?</h4><p>Yobel provides this service to Peru and Mexico predominately, though we work with companies from India and the US to implement supply chain management as well. We support the entire process: import/export, customs clearance, production, packaging, etc. This is the kind of supply chain management Yobel offers to its customers. Our aim is to incorporate more services into our portfolio and be a 4PL service provider.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Yobel's development in 2015 and onwards?</h4><p>For us, 2015 has been an interesting year in which we saw great development in the assembly and packaging segment that has opened doors and led to interesting business opportunities. It is difficult to talk about overall volumes for 2015, as it depends on the production segment being discussed. We expect to close the year with several new customers. In terms of direct sales, volumes have slightly decreased, but if we look at mass consumption volumes, assembly and packaging and distribution, we will close 2015 with a 22% growth compared to the previous year. This is due to our efforts to diversify our business portfolio. As for 2016, we aim to continue growing and creating more direct and indirect job opportunities for Ecuadorians. It is a great country to invest in and the workforce is highly skilled, hard working, creative and has a growing talent pool among graduates.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the challenges specifically related to human resources in Mozambique, and how does Coca-Cola work to overcome them?</h4><p>The biggest challenge we face in Mozambique is the high level of illiteracy, specifically in the area of technical education. We have spent $130 million on building a state-of-the-art factory. The equipment is extremely advanced, and one needs a high level of engineering skills to operate the equipment. Trying to find the caliber of people required within Mozambique is challenging due to a limited labor pool and insufficient technical education. We are working with technical colleges and we try to recruit the brightest pupils that graduate, but there are simply not enough of them for what we and other employers require. The problem is going to escalate once the oil and gas fields come online, as these companies have the ability to pay much higher salaries and they will take qualified human resources away from our industry. The alternative is to bring in expats to help train the local population, which is what we do. I believe there is real apathy regarding the scale of the challenge and we are going to have to accept that foreigners will be required to run certain parts of the industry for many years to come whilst continuing to develop Mozambican talent. All our plant managers are expatriates, and we feel at this time it is the most feasible way to control and manage the quality and technical efficiency of our plants. All expats come in for two or three-year assignments, and they are charged with selecting someone to take over from them when they leave. We at Coca-Cola are below the quota for foreign workers. We are spending $1.8 million on training and development for people in preparation for the move to the new factory.</p><h4>The Minister of Industry and Trade recently announced that Coca-Cola is looking into the possibility of using Mozambican sugar to manufacture soft drinks. What are the company's motivations behind this step?</h4><p>One of our goals whenever we go into a country is to use local goods as much as possible. However, the quality of the product has to be in line with the standards of the Coca-Cola Company. These standards do not vary between Atlanta or Delhi, or anywhere else in the world. Coca-Cola technicians audit and check factories that produce ingredients for us, and ensure that workers' rights are being upheld. We insist, for example, that ISO certificates are gained, and once the quality is right then the price also has to be right. We are currently working with the Mozambican government and other stakeholders, preparing them to possibly supply sugar to us. At the moment, the industry is not capable of producing the quantity of refined sugar that we require for our beverages. Investment in new refining capacity is needed if our projected requirements are to be met.</p><h4>How is Coca-Cola's branding strategy in Mozambique different from that of other markets?</h4><p>Mozambique is unique because it has a young population. Around 56% of people here are under 24 years of age, and that is really our target audience. We are also responsible in our marketing activities and do not target under-12s. Our campaigns are geared toward the teenage demographic. You have to remain relevant to the consumers and the continually changing landscape, so we have to constantly reinvent ourselves to keep coming up with new campaigns. You have to understand where the market is going, and for us the big trend we are seeing is the use of plastic bottles. When I first came here five years ago, about 85% of our volume came from glass bottles. As time has progressed, plastic has reached over 30% of our mix, and consumers have happily adopted this new form of packaging. We are making our investment decisions with this in mind. The trend works in our favor, as transportation costs are lower since there is no need to return the bottle. There are a lot of people in this country who have never tasted Coca-Cola, and per capita rates are probably amongst the lowest in the world at just 28 per capita per annum. We believe there is a huge amount of potential in Mozambique, as just across the border in South Africa consumption is over 200 per capita.</p><h4>Where do you see Coca-Cola in the next five years?</h4><p>One of the primary reasons we have invested over $200 million over the past five years is to expand capacity. In the past we never had sufficient capacity to meet demand, so my belief is if you build the capacity you will sell the volume. The Chimoio factory upgrade was completed in 2013, and we are about to open the newest factory shortly. The Nampula upgrade project has commenced, so all of our factories will have sufficient capacity beyond 2020. The second important point is that we are the only soft drinks business that has a dedicated sales source. We have a sales force on the ground, and 200 people across Mozambique selling our products. No other competitor has that sort of reach. There are sales reps but we call them developers because their focus is on developing the market. We have 15,000 coolers out in the market and 15,000 iceboxes to enable us to serve a perfect Coke all the time. In order for the consumer to go to the fridge and find Coke products in a Coke fridge nicely merchandised in an effective way, you need well-trained people to get it done.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Bozovich invested in innovation?</h4><p>We have invested a lot of time, effort, and money since our establishment 67 years ago in value-added products and processes, always focusing on how we can differentiate ourselves from our competitors. The sector that we operate in is one of a kind, and we are always innovating in terms of cutting-edge technology to produce just the highest-quality products. This has enabled us to open new and sophisticated markets. Today, we are present in markets all over the world. It is crucial to be innovative because other countries also have forest resources of their own and know how to work with wood. They have been doing it for centuries or even millennia. While tropical woods are more durable, beautiful, and more exotic looking, we have also been able to understand them and develop technologies to process high-end finished products. This allows us to compete in the US, Canada, Scandinavia, Western Europe, Australia, and Russia, against lower quality Brazilian and Indonesian products. The US is the number-one producer of wood in the world, yet it wants to buy from Peru because of the unique beauty and quality of our products.</p><h4>In a sector characterized by growing competition, building a reputation is crucial. How do you do this?</h4><p>Brand, brand, brand. Our name is recognized and has always been associated with quality and responsibility. This is true not only in the quality of the physical goods we deliver but in the way we do business, ship on time, and package. This is all important and sets us apart from the Latin American standard of doing business. The bulk of this market works with building materials, while we specialize in decoration materials.</p><h4>What is your customer profile?</h4><p>The majority of our customer base is international—90%. We have a broad range of customer types from DIY retailers, most of whom are in Europe and Latin America, to highly specialized manufacturers of furniture, doors, and fine instruments in North America. We do not sell in some Latin American countries because their economies are not doing well or their borders are closed to imports. There are other regions we do not reach yet such as the Middle East, North Africa, and India, but we actually buy some products from Western Africa when we need something special our forests don't produce. Overall, our customer base is a quality oriented one. Predictability on what they are going to get, and when, as well as proven sustainability, helps a lot.</p><h4>How do you maximize the efficiency of your operation?</h4><p>We have a state-of-the-art factory to which we moved five years ago from our original location in downtown Lima. We increased our production capacity, invested in new machinery and equipment and a forward-looking layout, with room to grow and innovate for approximately 30 years. Every two years, we invest and bring in new equipment and systems that help us get the best yield out of our precious raw materials. The production of timber in the forest is seasonal as it goes with the rainy and dry seasons, so in order to be able to serve a market 24/7, 365 days a year, it is necessary to carry large inventories and work them down eventually through the non-harvesting season. Few companies can do this due to lack of space, financial capacity, and long-term vision.</p><h4>What steps are you taking to reduce the impact of your business on the environment?</h4><p>Our activity is totally neutral on the environment, as the activity that we perform is sustainable and renewable. We are actually ensuring the conservation of these forests by harvesting them responsibly. We avoid deforestation that otherwise would threaten this resources from other economic activities just by being there. We are certified under the FSC standards for sustainable forest management and chain of custody by SGS, which is a third party that assures that our activities are sustainable, socially, environmentally, and economically.</p><h4>Do you have specific markets that you are targeting with your expansion plans?</h4><p>We are targeting Russia and Germany because they are both major markets that have been unattended by us until recently; it is just a pending assignment of the never-ending diversification of the risk process. We are always looking for the best business partner, the one that shares our values and principles, and who really appreciates quality and sustainability. In the case of Russia it is more about brand and high quality, while in Germany it is more about sustainability certification schemes and service . Those are our main focus markets today, but we are also trying to work with Korea as we have a big presence in East Asia. We are starting to prospect Korea and hopefully we will start doing business there next year. We are already working in Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines, which are all producing nations themselves. We manufacture some goods in China as well, using our own raw materials, standards, specifications, and brand. We make some decorative panels and engineered flooring there. We have an office in Taiwan with three people on board all the time selling our goods, supervising and controlling the manufacturing we do there. Most of these Chinese products are brought back to Latin America for distribution, where we are the strongest; we understand Latin American tastes so we can successfully produce goods in Asia for Mexico, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Colombia, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic. This is the fastest-growing category of products nowadays.</p><h4>Do you have any priority targets for 2016?</h4><p>We are currently considering a potential partnership and investment in forest plantations. There are many areas in Peru that were forested once but which are now degraded because of migratory agriculture and extensive cattle raising. We are looking at a project with a large piece of degraded land and we hope to set up some plantations. There are also other secondary forests left that we would like to enrich.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[heading-toward-a-healthier-agro-future]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Stockton Group is present in 35 countries around the world. As a pioneer in biopesticides, what were some of the challenges you had to overcome before entering this market?</h4><p>In an agricultural industry that is dominated by six major players, and which is over 80% generic, Stockton aims to play an important role by significantly adding value and innovation to this arena. Stockton, which has been in operation for 20 years, has always sold generic products exclusively. During the last decade, Stockton Group has been focusing on the introduction of additional value to the agriculture industry. We are one of the pioneers in the field of biopesticides. We develop, manufacture, and sell plant extract-based biopesticides with the intention of integrating them into conventional spraying programs. The expectation in the industry is that this segment will be worth more than $6 billion in the coming years. We have been exploring the potential capabilities of biopesticides by demonstrating their value for other important players' lines of business. We are confident that these products will be a winning solution because they extend the length of the chemical product for distributors, and they increase the yield and quality of grains for many crops. Moreover, their use creates cleaner and healthier foods. Though biopesticides remain a secondary player in this industry, they are, nonetheless, important.</p><h4>Where does Panama fit into the picture?</h4><p>We are entering the Panamanian market at a stage where there are diversified crops so we are targeting those crops for which biopesticides can create a higher value than other products. We usually begin with fruits and vegetables, as they are more sensitive to chemicals and tend to be consumed by end users in their unprocessed form. We launched our efforts with rice in Panama after attaining positive results in other countries. Rice is an export crop in Panama, so quality control is a central issue for the industry. The results for farmers are much better in the long term. Government subsidies for crops, including rice, allow for better cash flow. We are also considering working with coffee and other crops in Panama. The reason we entered Panama was because of the diversity of its crops, the exportation of its output, and its openness to the benefits of biopesticides.</p><h4>What are you doing to raise awareness of the benefits of biopesticides at the regional and national levels?</h4><p>Big changes in the industry are always mediated to some extent by the biggest players. Established companies recently started warming to biopesticides after seeing that it was not a threat to their chemical portfolio, but rather a complement to it. Once they understood that, the real journey began in terms of M&amp;A licensing, and distribution agreements between the big players and the biopesticide producers. Biopesticides are now an integrated part of the industry and everybody has accepted that there is a legitimate place for these products in their portfolios. We are still at different levels on the learning curve for our products, and the growth of the sector depends on extracting maximum value throughout the distribution chain.</p><h4>How will China's Hebang Group's recent acquisition of 51% of the company affect Stockton's operations and further its expansion?</h4><p>This was an important event for us, considering Stockton has been a family-owned company for the past 20 years. Our relationship with Hebang is extremely good. In the past, Stockton relied on its own internal resources in terms of investments, goals, and business strategy. This deal allows us to carry out more ambitious plans. Stockton's vision is to become a leader in biopesticides, and to integrate this product into the conventional spraying program. This increased financing will help us develop additional commercial products besides our already well-known products, like the Timorex Gold fungicide. The new ownership structure will also enable us to penetrate new markets such as the US, China, India, Japan, and Europe. Our new shareholders have made it clear that they would like to see the company listed on the NASDAQ exchange in the next 3-4 years, so we are working toward that goal. Another aspect of this investment will be Stockton's ability to start screening and collaborating with the aim of discovering additional biopesticide technologies.</p><h4>What new products are you are preparing to bring to the market?</h4><p>We want to diversify our product lines into herbicides and insecticides. We also want to strengthen the appeal of our products in the market. The early stages of our research are spent seeking ways to purify biological AI technology in order to make them viable. Almost 70% of a plant's structural mechanism is meant to be defensive. That is a fantastic place to look for implementing crop protection solutions, and we intend to invest in more research to launch more plant-based products.</p><h4>Looking ahead, where do you think Stockton will have the biggest impact in terms of the reach of its products?</h4><p>Our vision for Stockton is to become a place of innovation where ideas become realities that can be applied in new and different ways. We want to bring our new technologies all the way to the individual farmer. Part of our mission is to help create technology that will benefit all of humanity. It would be great if Stockton could succeed in actualizing this goal.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2016?</h4><p>The same challenges I mentioned earlier apply to 2016, as well. We are preparing to enter the complex US market, while working on the launch of at least one or two more products during 2016-17. We are also planning to accelerate our development through M&amp;A, and acquiring either products or companies in order to deepen our development pipeline.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How significant has Qatar Airways' fleet program been to the overall success of the company?</h4><p>Qatar Airways operates one of the youngest fleets in the sky, which includes the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, Airbus A380 and, as the global launch customer, the Airbus A350 XWB. These aircraft offer passengers a superior cabin environment, one which reduces the symptoms of jet lag and fatigue associated with long-haul travel. By also offering Wi-Fi connectivity and the latest cabin design enhancements, passengers can choose to either create an office in the sky or relax while enjoying more than 2,000 entertainment options on our newly launched Oryx One inflight entertainment system. Having one of the world's youngest fleets, with an average aircraft age of no more than four years, also leads to lower emissions and contributes to Qatar Airways' environmental commitment and responsibility.</p><h4>What potential does the Asian market represent to Qatar Airways and what is the regional strategy going forward?</h4><p>Qatar Airways has undergone unprecedented growth in its 18 years of operation, and it is set to continue, with significant growth in Asia throughout that period. Asia is an important and strategic market for Qatar Airways and it is for this reason we chose Singapore as one of the first inaugural routes for the latest generation A350 XWB aircraft, of which Qatar Airways was the Global Launch Customer for. On June 1st, 2015, a third-daily frequency to Singapore was added, and all three Qatar Airways daily flights to Singapore all operate with the A350 WXB, increasing overall capacity on the route in 2015 by 67%. With the progressive addition of the A350 XWB and the increase in capacity, not only are more passengers be able to experience our award-winning product, but they also benefit from shorter transit times for onward connecting flights to and from Europe, Africa, and the US. This is complemented by the opening last year of our new hub and home, Hamad International Airport, which enables our passengers to enjoy a comprehensive, five-star experience at the world's newest international gateway. Hamad International Airport provides a seamless, hassle-free travel experience for our passengers, from check-in and passport control right through to boarding. The opening of the new airport has also resulted in expedient, convenient transfers for connecting passengers. Hamad International Airport can connect passengers through with a minimum connection time of 45 minutes or less. The airport boasts over 600,000 sqm of space, 40,000 of which are dedicated to 70 top-of-the-line retail outlets and 30 food and beverage options. Additional features include a 200-room hotel, a spa, squash courts, activity nodes, and art installations throughout the terminal.</p><h4>How has Qatar Airways played a role in achieving the government's initiative of Qatarization?</h4><p>At Qatar Airways, we understand our responsibility in playing a pivotal role to foster and nurture the talent of Qatari youth wishing to develop a career path. We also acknowledge that we need them to build upon the foundation and to develop the future of the company, which is why we have created individually tailored programs under the talent development program called Al Darb, or “The Pathway," to bring out the best in an individual, playing to their unique skills and strengths. We offer 9 different tailor-made development programmes to our Qatari recruits, as well as sponsoring 23 majors. Qatari young men and women alike come to work for us with great aspirations and we put them on individual pathways to success and a rewarding career in aviation. Every national recruit has a performance coach who has been trained by the Air Business Academy (ABA) to support and nurture them for the first two years within the business, helping to build a foundation of professionals and develop future leaders.</p><h4>In what ways do the Qatar Airways subsidiaries add value to the overall product and service offering of the group?</h4><p>Operating one of the world's leading airlines requires the support of a number of ground service and subsidiary companies, of which the Qatar Airways Group is uniquely placed. Operating under one collective and cohesive group, Qatar Airways is able to grow at an astounding rate with the knowledge and support of its subsidiary companies, namely the Qatar Aircraft Catering Company, Qatar Aviation Company, Qatar Airways Cargo, and Al Maha Services to name just a few. Qatar Airways Cargo was recently ranked the third-largest cargo operator globally, attesting to its massive operations with the newly opened cargo facility at Hamad International Airport. This collaborative growth of our subsidiary companies, in line with the goals and aspirations of the airline itself and the support of our new home and hub Hamad International Airport, allows Qatar Airways to go from strength-to-strength each year of our relatively short history.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the year ahead?</h4><p>Our aim is to keep exceeding passengers' expectations and to explore new ways to introduce product excellence and innovation in how we deliver our five-star signature service on board. Qatar Airways was recently named at the annual Skytrax World Airline Awards as Airline of the Year for a third time, a proud accomplishment for an airline to reach multiple times. The highest ranking in the annual Skytrax awards category, Airline of the Year is a marker of the commitment and dedication to service excellence and a high-quality travel experience for all passengers that fly with Qatar Airways. It is a reflection of the five-star caliber service that Qatar Airways is renowned for, and is a success that we will continue to build upon in the year ahead and into 2016. Aside from this, 2016 will be a year of expansion with more frequencies to existing gateways and new destinations, expanding to even more opportunities for travellers. In January 2016 we will launch direct flights to Los Angeles, with further gateways to Atlanta (June) and Boston (March) added shortly after, together with upgrading our service to Philadelphia to operate with an Airbus A350 XWB, and the launch of double-daily flights with this same aircraft to New York in the spring. We know how important it is to have a network that takes our passengers to their destination as swiftly and comfortably as possible, with the best available aircraft in the skies, which is why Qatar Airways will continue to grow while not compromising on our high standards of service.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can you secure innovation in the airport retail sector?</h4><p>We try to improve all of the time; we invest in technology and have recently introduced an online shopping portal that we expect to become increasingly important to our business and to our customers. Refurbishment is also necessary, and we closely examine how we deal with our passengers. If we identify congestion then we change and we have recently agreed with the airport to remove a number of retail structures from the center aisle in what we call Concourse B because of congestion. We keep trying to offer better value to the customers and we seek to be the number one in duty free from the point of view of special offers and ensuring that customers get what they want. We work closely with our suppliers to this end. We also have digital advertisement applications at the airports showcasing Dubai Duty Free's offers.</p><h4>What is the average return on sale per square meter at Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>In 2013, our average return on sale per square meter was $80,000, while the average of the rest of duty free was at $34,000 per sqm. Last year we reached $82,000 per sqm while the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in New York City was at $66,000. Once we open Concourse D at Dubai International Airport in 2016, the new 7,000 sqm of retail space will lower our average return. So we expect to be at $72,000 next year, which is still considerably above the average.</p><h4>How would you say that Dubai Duty Free operations contribute to the Emirate's economy?</h4><p>Let me start by saying that 70% of our products are acquired locally, helping suppliers, wholesalers, and importers. We have 6,000 employees to which we provide rented accommodation and we also own 740 apartments that house some of our employees. These employees spend money in Dubai, and not only them but also all their friends and family members who come visit every year. We not only give our employees accommodation, but flight tickets, too. They are all contributing to the development of Dubai. We sponsor a lot of events, like the Tennis Championships, which generates over $800 million worth of TV exposure for Dubai, as well as supporting the DP World Tour Championships, the Emirates Rugby 7s, and many more major events. In addition to that we own the Dubai Tennis Stadium, the Irish Village, and the Jumeirah Creekside Hotel. We are also planning on developing the Irish Village in a new theme park that will be constructed here in the UAE.</p><h4>In 2014, Dubai Duty Free achieved record sales of $1.917 billion. What prospect of growth do you have for 2015?</h4><p>We expect sales to be close to $2 billion. Currently, we account for over 6% of the total sales in duty free around the world.</p><h4>What strategy will Dubai Duty Free follow in the run up to Expo 2020?</h4><p>The build up to Expo 2020 is very exciting and the development of Dubai South, which will be the venue for the Expo being close to Al Maktoum International, will see much activity in the coming years. By 2020 we expect to reach $3 million and have 9,000 employees. It is expected that Dubai South will generate 260,000 jobs. At Al Maktoum we will open up to 80,000 sqm, which will mean around 3 to 4,000 jobs.</p><h4>For the second consecutive year you have won the award for “Best Restructuring in the Middle East" by EMEA Finance Achievement Awards. To what do you attribute the banking community's confidence in Dubai Duty Free?</h4><p>We have been dealing with banks for many years and they know our track record; we have never not paid anybody or paid someone late. We have always paid our staff on time and when something happens like holidays or national holidays, we pay our staff earlier in the month. We now have close to 6,000 staff and we have kept that record. We have never defaulted with the bank, and we have taken out two different loans; the money went to infrastructure development at the airport. At that time, interest rates were getting lower and lower, so we negotiated with the banks and they agreed that we were a sound and safe company for repayments; there were 26 banks involved in the first loan. We were able to restructure the loan, saving ourselves AED70 million, and it was because of our track record that the banks were happy to do this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The New Economic University has received excellent rankings. What factors lie behind its success?</h4><p>Our long tradition of 52 years has contributed to the high-quality education we have cultivated. Our graduates hold top positions in the country in politics and in business. In fact, many schools in the country have developed in the fields of economics, finance, and other fields related to business. We strive to look at what is happening in the global field of education on a yearly basis and adopt the methodology that works to stay ahead of others. For example, we are now developing a platform for a new format of courses for distance education that will allow people in remote parts of Kazakhstan to study at our university, much more effectively than in the case of traditional e-learning platforms. We are also looking beyond our borders; in our strategy for the next three years we stated that the goal is to become the best and most innovative economic university in Central Asia. In every step that we take, we adjust our programs in dialogue with our business partners.</p><h4>How would you describe New Economic University's relationship with the local business community?</h4><p>We have 21 specializations; we do not teach theory and want to be as close to the market as possible. Every specialization that we have has to have at least two business partners to involve their opinion on the programs and courses we offer. Our business partners send their people to work with students and to offer master classes for students. We have examined the competencies that are needed in the market, such as working in teams, the ability to make decisions and solve problems, understanding clients' needs, and so on. We source problems from the business community that our students solve as diplomas, as opposed to writing a thesis based a theoretical topic they or their professors choose, and the client gives them feedback on their work. If the results are good, the company that worked with them often offers the student a position. This is innovation on a global scale because the majority of students still write diplomas that nobody reads.</p><h4>What role will New Economic University play in the president's vision to build an economy based on innovation and knowledge, including integration into the global educational space?</h4><p>Our vision is to become more and more innovative. We want to lead and show other universities what can be done in Kazakhstan. To match the needs of the local economy, we have established a business incubator that is the first private commercial business incubator in Kazakhstan and is open to all people from Kazakhstan and beyond. We already have people coming from Kyrgyzstan and Russia. The incubator's focus is making money, without relying on government funding. We invited the most successful network of entrepreneurs to develop this program. We are investing KZT20 million per year in the incubator.</p><h4>As the university's new rector, what goals would you like to achieve in the medium term?</h4><p>Our university is a leader in the fields of economics, finance, accounting, and statistics, and we set the standard for others. This is an opportunity to not only transform one university into an internationally recognized brand in Central Asia and beyond, but also an opportunity to transform the entire higher education system in Kazakhstan, or at least contribute to this transformation. It is rare to have the opportunity to get a job that can actually influence something of that scale. For any rector or any manager of a university, there is one major goal that matters. I want 100% of my students to be employed or have their own companies. I want them to have income that is well above the income of graduates of other universities.</p>]]></richbody0content>
