		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the overall regional size of Medgulf in the MENA region?</h4><p>Medgulf is one of the largest privately held insurance groups in the region. We compete with other privately owned firms, as well as publicly held firms. Over the last few years, we have been constantly ranked among the top three companies in the region. We are humbled by this as we continue to diligently grow our business platforms across the entire region. Two years ago, we broke the billion-dollar mark in gross written premium (GWP) terms. Our strategic plan calls for targeted growth over the next few years. This is a reflection of our hard work and on market recognition of the importance of the insurance segment in the development of the regional economy.</p><h4>What have been your YoY growth figures for 2013?</h4><p>Our Group CAGR over the last three years reached 16.5%. Our YoY growth has varied from 13% to over 25%. We expect that we will experience growth figures of around 15% over 2014.</p><h4>What is your strategy with regard to pricing?</h4><p>We have always run a service and quality to price value model. In addition, the regulators today demand that the industry prices its products at cost plus. We have an actuary price model and we abide by it.</p><div class="quote">“We have worked very hard for many years to build Medgulf into an institution where creativity and hard work are synonyms."</div><h4>Why do you feel than many companies look to Medgulf as a benchmark insurance company?</h4><p>We have worked very hard for many years to build Medgulf into an institution where creativity and hard work are synonyms, and where an entrepreneurial spirit thrives in a model of corporate governance. We are transparent in the way we do our business, and we work every day to strengthen our communications and brainstorming with our regulators. It gives us pride, here at Medgulf, that our hard work has delivered our company to benchmark status.</p><h4>Would you say this is a reflection of the transparency in your business practices?</h4><p>Transparency is one of the attributes that we try to build in everything we do here at Medgulf. Our partners, the IFC and the Orix Group, are as adamant as we are to continue down this path.</p><h4>Which of your insurance services are in highest demand in the region at the moment?</h4><p>Medical insurance has been, for the last few years, the fastest growing product in our portfolio. But this is simply a reflection of the market place. Our motor insurance pool has been growing steadily, also. In addition, our engineering segment has been performing very strongly. Medgulf succeeded late last year in winning nearly three-quarters of the Riyadh Metro contract, an SAR100 billion project.</p><h4>Medgulf states that part of its mission is to restore the reputation of the insurance industry in the Middle East. How successful do you feel you have been?</h4><p>This is a work in progress. I believe that, to date, we have been successful. We discussed earlier how successful we have been in institutionalizing Medgulf, and how our company is perceived to be the industry benchmark. I strongly believe that we have moved the perception of the market place of the insurance industry from being simply a brokerage business, to a full understanding of risk underwriting. Insurance, as you know, is an essential tool in developing any economy. And that is being recognized more and more. Our work with the regulators, in implementing strict industry wide controls, has delivered nicely toward strengthening our industry. In addition, our consistent financial performance and our strong capital base have dramatically improved customer confidence in Medgulf and in our work.</p><h4>How significant was the partnership between the IFC and Medgulf in 2011?</h4><p>In addition to being a financial giant, the IFC is the global reference in corporate governance and compliance. We were absolutely delighted that it recognized our position as leaders in the region in developing these management tools. It has been key in helping us get stronger and better in this area. In addition, and due to the nature of their strategic interest in economic development, it is involved with us in defining market and strategic opportunities that will strengthen Medgulf in the near future.</p><h4>You are currently a public listed company in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Do you have any intentions to list on the London or Dubai exchanges?</h4><p>It is too early for us to discuss this as we see little need for us to raise capital over the short term. But things do change, and we always brainstorm strategic moves. For the time being, we are totally focused on implementing our strategic plan.</p><h4>In what ways are you trying to restructure your manpower to improve corporate governance?</h4><p>Training, training, and training. We offer our associates education and training in insurance programs from worldwide institutions, such as from the Chartered Insurance Institute. We have introduced an internal program to cross train our colleagues on all aspects of our insurance operations in order to encourage in-house promotions. We are investing heavily in bringing in outside consultants to chaperone and support this process. This is our commitment to support and develop a second-to-none human resource capability that will lead our group in the years ahead.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the key elements of energy sector reform?</h4><p>There are four main elements supporting the new structure. The Mexican state retains full ownership of hydrocarbon reserves. The participation of private investment in the new scheme would be in association with the owner of the oil reserves, which is the Mexican state, and which will offer contracts and licenses to private participants. The Mexican state also maintains full ownership of the former state monopolies, PEMEX and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). The government will charge royalties for the exploitation of these reserves, and a sovereign Mexican oil fund will be incorporated in order to create transparency in the management of the economic rent generated by their exploitation. The other main component foresees PEMEX and CFE transforming from a monopoly to a dominant state-owned entity. For that, there will be a new legal structure and a new legal statute transforming PEMEX and CFE into productive enterprises competing on equal terms with private companies, but still as state-owned entities. Another factor is the strengthening of the government's regulatory role; there will be at least four entities regulating the oil and gas industry. The National Hydro-Carbon Commission has to be strengthened considerably because the only regulated entity to date was PEMEX, and its authority must be extended. The Energy Regulatory Commission will concentrate on downstream activities and the distribution of oil and gas. Then, there is going to be a new entity to operate the natural gas system that PEMEX has built over the years. It will take assets from PEMEX and operate as a new autonomous entity. There is also going to be a new agency focused on safety and environmental protection for the energy sector. The main element of the reform is in allowing private investment all along the value chain of the industry, starting with exploration and production. Another important element of these developments is that the National Hydrocarbons Commission will provide access to all the seismic and geological information that PEMEX has accumulated over the years. This is the first time that private investors will be privy to this seismic information. One important issue is that although the hydrocarbon reserves will be kept under the property of the Mexican state, the contractors or owners of licenses issued by the state will be able to register the economic interests derived from the licenses or contracts.</p><h4>How do you see the relationship between PEMEX and service companies in the oil and gas industry developing?</h4><p>PEMEX is going through the most important transition of its corporate life. It will be 76 years old in 2014, and it has never faced anything like the current challenge. It is going to be a difficult transition, but I am convinced that PEMEX has the strength that will allow it to become a dominant player in the market. Obviously, the Mexican oil service companies, whom I represent through AMESPAC, are counting on PEMEX becoming a dominant player and trusting in its strength to face the new competition. We are preparing to help them and all operators who are interested in entering the Mexican market with critical supplies, equipment, and services. Some of the companies that belong to AMESPAC have most of the capabilities required to become independent operators of oil and gas fields. We are counting on some of these Mexican-owned corporations being able to transform themselves from oil service entities into fully independent operators in new areas such as shale gas and oil, and develop mature oil fields that in many cases PEMEX has abandoned. Mexican companies only need to complement their capabilities. We hope to develop independent Mexican oil and gas operators, and are awaiting the arrival of the next PEMEX of the oil and gas industry.</p><div class="quote">“The main element of the reform is in allowing private investment all along the value chain of the industry."</div><h4>What are your expectations regarding foreign private investment?</h4><p>Since there is going to be a very wide range of investment opportunities post reform, we have tried to estimate the potential for new private investment in Mexico that could be attracted under these new terms. The current investment program that PEMEX has developed for 2014 is worth $27.7 billion, but will likely grow to the range of $30 billion per year for the rest of decade. This represents about 2% of GDP. Furthermore, we assumed that four deepwater fields would be developed beginning in 2016, and throughout the decade we estimated that each field would cost about $6.5 billion, which is a low range average. We made a similar calculation for shale gas assuming that new operators would drill 1,000 new wells. Over the rest of the decade there is also a lot of potential for midstream activity, because we have a great need for storage facilities and pipelines, which were not built because of PEMEX's budget limitations. The end result is that PEMEX will continue to invest around $30 billion annually, with an additional $30 billion on average coming from private investment. This means that, assuming 4% GDP growth, the average CAPEX in oil and gas will grow by around 16% for the rest of the decade. By 2018, we are assuming $60 billion in investment, half from PEMEX and half from the private sector. Obviously, the private sector will grow more in the later stages.</p><h4>How do you view partnerships and joint ventures as a way to enter the market?</h4><p>I think that for some of the oil service international companies that have been operating in Mexico for many years, it will just be a multiplication of their market. There are also many companies that are suppliers for new operators, and when these new operators come, they will invite old partners that will have to find a strategy to establish their business here. One of them might be able to acquire a joint venture with a Mexican service company that has these facilities in place in Mexico. In some cases they might decide to go about this themselves. I would say that Mexico has a friendly investment structure. The oil and electricity sectors provide these opportunities, and the regulatory framework is available.</p><h4>What would you say are the biggest challenges for the sector over the next year?</h4><p>There are many challenges. We have only had one operating company in each sector, so we need to think of all the elements to assemble and create a competitive structure. But even if we do not get it right the first time around, the legal structure allows us to adopt, modify, and adapt. The government is designing a first round of bids for upstream that will reach the market by the middle of 2015. It is sending the message that Mexico will produce a diversified round of tenders that will include mature fields, which is something that Mexican companies and independent operators would be interested in. PEMEX has been the only potential player with the legal right to work in over 400 developed fields. The opportunities will be huge if the terms and conditions of the contract are competitive. These are the three elements, or what we in the industry call “prospectivity," i.e. opportunities in the oil and gas market, legal certainty, and being fiscally competitive. If these three requirements are met, it will be a very attractive opportunity.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The Chamber of Commerce was established 100 years ago. What was the philosophy behind the creation of this institution?</h4><p>The Chamber was created by a group of intellectuals who wanted to defend the country's interests. The Chamber of Commerce has always supported the development of business, and has collaborated with the government in the best interests of the country. In 1986 and 1987, during the dictatorship of Manuel Noriega, the Chamber of Commerce created the Cruzada Civilista, which was joined by various organizations in Panama to seek basic freedoms for the country, which were being denied to Panamanians. Therefore, our remit has not only been to help businesses, but moreover the country at large.</p><h4>What does the Chamber do to protect its members' interests?</h4><p>Most of the time we defend our members by negotiating with the government on prospective legislation that is not necessarily in the best interests of business people and traders. We also help our members to establish free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries to boost the national economy, which helps our members to expand their enterprises. We also help the government understand the impact of laws and taxes on business and advise on what we see as best for the country. The most important benefit is having a 100-year-old organization fighting in your corner.</p><h4>The Chamber is committed to national development through the CCIAP Foundation. What education initiatives has the Chamber sponsored?</h4><p>The most important consideration for any country is a well-educated population, as this is the root of development. The Chamber of Commerce is committed to helping the Ministry of Education develop new methods of teaching, and we also assist children in rural areas that lack adequate resources. Once a year we choose one community and the entire Chamber collaborates to establish support for it. That is one of the most-pressing problems in Panama. The country has virtually reached capacity employment, so as an organization we aim to develop further work opportunities for its citizens. Firstly, we need to improve people's access to education so they can subsequently gain access not just to a basic salary, but also to a job that allows them to develop themselves. One of the main initiatives that we started around 10 years ago was the English as a Second Language program, through which the Chamber and the government worked to make all public schools teach English.</p><h4>What is your evaluation of English language penetration in the country's economic sectors?</h4><p>Among business people you will find high-level, English-speaking individuals. If you go to public schools you will see that there is a lot of work to be done, and the new program has not been well established because there is a shortage of English teachers. We have a deficiency in some of our sectors because we do not have enough fluent English speakers; for example, in tourism. Some people assume that because we are a small country, we do not need to speak English, but actually this is the only real way to take advantage of the impressive opportunities that are being developed in the country.</p><div class="quote">“The most important consideration for any country is a well-educated population."</div><h4>Law 41 on Sede de Empresas Multinacionales came into force in 2007. What is your evaluation of this law and its advantages for multinational companies coming to Panama?</h4><p>We developed a committee run by one of our presidents that created a joint venture to assess business necessities and how the Chamber could help satisfy those needs. For example, in Panama Pacifico, one of the main bases for multinational companies, around 9,000 or 10,000 jobs have been created to date. The presence of these enterprises in Panama has helped to increase employment opportunities in terms of wages and salaries. One of the factors attracting companies is the legal framework. Then, of course, there is the connectivity offered by the national airline, the low cost of living in Panama, and the stability and security of the country.</p><h4>What impact will the Panama Canal expansion project have for companies established in Panama and for the country as a whole?</h4><p>The original canal is still operational, but the wider canal will run parallel, so there will be standard shipping traffic using the smaller canal, while wider shipping will be accommodated by the second. Labor, supplies, shipping, and other services will be demanded around the wider canal, with the impact not only being felt in Panama, but also across the globe. The US, for example, has already started a number of port expansion projects in Miami, New Orleans, and Houston. Even the UK is widening its ports for larger vessels, because once the Panama Canal becomes operational, traffic will increase. Although this is a small country, it is changing the way the world does business, as it did 100 years ago when it opened.</p><h4>What is your medium-term economic outlook?</h4><p>I expect GDP growth of close to 7% this year. Direct investments should approach $3 billion, and the most dynamic sectors currently are logistics, construction, retail, and wholesale, as well as finance and insurance. Industry and agriculture will remain limited contributors to the economy. Unemployment will be stable at 4%, and the inflation rate will be close to 3% or 4%.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the successes of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry (JCCI) under your leadership over recent years?</h4><p>This chamber of commerce was the first in the Kingdom, and it was already a successful entity before I came on board. All of my colleagues, past and present, have contributed to building a successful organization that has been operating now for around 70 years. When I took over five years ago, a solid infrastructure was already in place, as well as an established and prestigious name, and we are continuing to leverage this. We have a large project already underway set to officially open in 2014, namely the Center for Development and Unemployment, which will crucially provide people with an opportunity to find work. We do not believe that finding employment in itself is the only way, as we also hope to create opportunities for people to find work either by starting their own business, or by building partnerships, and I forecast the center officially opening in 2014 to the advantage of the Kingdom and the Arab region.</p><h4>Aside from the many initiatives to create employment in the Kingdom, the JCCI also works to promote trade between the Kingdom and in the rest of the world. Where do you see the JCCI in a global sense?</h4><p>A new location in the King Abdullah Economic City, north of Jeddah, will play a key role in developing trade between all OIC countries. I am the Chairman of the Islamic Chamber of Commerce (ICC), as well as the chairman of the JCCI, and between these two chambers we have major plans to develop trade among OIC countries.</p><h4>How do you perceive OIC trade as a unique niche for Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>We regret that trade among OIC countries has been low; it is especially a shame given our proximity and common historical relations. The ICC supports a plan that has raised the level of trade from 11% in 2008 to its current level of 14% or 15%. This is still not sufficient, and much infrastructure has yet to be developed, which is what we will seek to achieve with the next project.</p><div class="quote">“All of my colleagues, past and present, have contributed to building a successful organization."</div><h4>By 2020, Saudi Arabia will have become a very different country in the wake of numerous megaprojects. Where do you hope to see the JCCI by that year?</h4><p>We will be an active player in such initiatives, and these megaprojects underway will continue in different fields. For example, we will construct a major new convention center and other facilities to advance our mission. Additionally, we will be a major player in facilitating growth and international cooperation. By inviting trade delegations and encouraging Saudi companies to take advantage of government initiatives, we hope to see many local companies expand abroad and take on joint-venture partners here in Saudi Arabia. Through the reputation we have established and on the strength of our geographic location, we will work to make a name for Jeddah as a port and an international city of commerce, and to promote Saudi Arabia as the regional economic force it already is. Infrastructure projects such as King Abdullah Port, the Economic City, the new railways, and the King Abdullah International Airport will make these goals a reality when combined with the efforts of the Chamber and businesses across the country.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of the Shah Deniz II final investment decision (FID)?</h4><p>The signing of the FID is no less than a turning point for the industry. We value the project as a major driver of the energy strategy developed in the mid-1990s. The signing of the FID in December 2013 dramatically increases our export potential as it covers not only the full development of the Shah Deniz gas field, but also the construction of the Southern Gas Corridor, infrastructure that will deliver Azerbaijani gas to European markets. The Southern Gas Corridor is a chain of several projects including the expansion of the South Caucasus Pipeline, the construction of the Trans-Anatolian Pipeline (TANAP), and the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP). We plan to deliver the first extracted gas from Shah Deniz, utilizing TANAP, to Turkey in mid-2018 and to Europe through TAP in 2019.</p><h4>Given the international nature of the projects, what challenges do you anticipate in building and operating the TAP and TANAP?</h4><p>These two large-scale projects, with a total length of over 2,600 kilometers, will head from Turkey crossing Greece, Albania, the Adriatic Sea, and come ashore in Italy. Taking into account the sheer scale of investment, the number of companies involved, and the diversity of countries, projects such as TANAP and TAP usually present major challenges on their own. Being aware of the potential risks and challenges, we constantly work with our partners to identify risks and implement effective risk management strategies, which is an ongoing process. TAP and TANAP are very well positioned due to their strategic importance for Europe's energy security policy. Therefore, the projects are supported not only by the participating member countries, but also by the EU as a whole. From an international perspective based on that information, TAP and TANAP fall into the low-risk projects category. However, we are exposed to the risk of rising steel prices due to the lack of long-term hedging instruments. Another type of common potential risk is the disruption to materials supply at the construction stage of projects, preventing timely execution. We have understood and evaluated the possible impact of these risks for our projects; therefore, we have taken the appropriate pro-active measures to mitigate them. These measures are not limited to the hiring of a highly skilled and experienced management team, and the involvement of third-parties in order to achieve minimum deviation—if any—in both the cost and the schedule of the projects respectively.</p><div class="quote">“Currently, SOCAR is the owner of companies operating in Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, Switzerland, and other countries."</div><h4>The Umid field was SOCAR's single largest gas condensate find. How has production at the field performed since 2010?</h4><p>The SOCAR-UMID LLC, a joint venture between SOCAR (80% working interest) and Nobel Oil Exploration and Production Ltd. (20% working interest) was established in May 2008 for the exploration of the Umid structure. The exploration program was approved on July 24, 2009. Drilling at the first exploration well started in September 2009 and was concluded in November 2010 with a gas discovery at a 6,006-meter depth. On the same day, SOCAR made a public announcement on the estimated reserves at Umid, putting the figure at a minimum of 200 bcm of gas and 30 million tons of condensate. In May 2011, SOCAR and Nobel Oil approved a decision on the drilling of a second exploration well at Umid, which commenced in July 2011 and finished in April 2012 at a depth of 6,400 meters. The well was successfully flow tested with 1.2 mcm of gas and 150 tons of condensate at the wellhead. Pilot production from this well started in September 2012, and by January 2014 accumulated net production from the well was 251 mcm of gas and 40,000 tons of condensate. On September 26, 2012, SOCAR and Nobel Oil approved a decision on the drilling of a third exploration well at the Umid field, which started in November 2012 and ended in December 2013 at the depth 6,309 meters. The well was successfully tested in January of 2014 with a flow of 1.5 mcm of gas and 200 tons of condensate at the wellhead.</p><h4>What were the noteworthy downstream developments for SOCAR in 2013, and what are your plans for 2014?</h4><p>Currently, the oil and gas processing and petrochemical complex (OGPC) is SOCAR's largest downstream project in Azerbaijan, and boasts national significance. Its development stage started in 2013 and will continue throughout 2014. The complex will consist of an oil refinery with a capacity of around 9 million tons and a gas refinery with a capacity of 12 bcm, as well as a petrochemical plant. Completion of the complex is scheduled for 2020. Meanwhile, in Turkey, we initiated downstream investments to become the major shareholders of the Petkim Petrochemical Complex in 2008 and, since then, have successfully developed our business in that market. We continue to invest in the expansion of certain product lines and complex facilities. In 2013, we also started construction of the STAR Refinery with the capacity to process 10 million tons of crude oil per annum, which will pave the way for future regional projects. The STAR Refinery will be built using environmentally friendly technologies to produce petroleum products such as diesel oil, jet fuel, and LPG, for example. It will also produce 1.6 million tons of naphtha, which will reduce the dependency of the petrochemical sector on imported oil products.</p><h4>What role will initiatives like the Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute, as well as the Science Fund, play in the company's future development?</h4><p>As a successful global company, R&amp;D is of the essence, including in particular the development of nanotechnologies. SOCAR, along with its Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute, boasts a nanotechnologies department within the company structure. The fact that most of the Oil and Gas Research and Design Institute's world-class research projects have been certified, and that the institute has over 1,200 inventions in its portfolio, shows that we have already registered strong achievements in R&amp;D. In addition to this, SOCAR's nanotechnology department holds four related patents. Elaborate technologies are being continuously tested on our wells. Our Science Fund is also dedicated to stimulating scientists external to the company to conduct research in our fields of interest. We believe that someday our in-house research has the capacity to contribute not only to the company's future development, but also to the development of the oil and gas industry worldwide.</p><h4>To what extent has SOCAR become an international actor in the energy sector?</h4><p>Currently, SOCAR is the owner of companies operating in Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, Switzerland, and other countries. The largest component of our international portfolio, worth approximately $20 billion, including TANAP, is located in Turkey, where we hold a major share in the Petkim Petrochemical Complex, projects such as the STAR Refinery, and other mainly downstream assets. SOCAR is currently the biggest foreign direct investor in Turkey. We are also the largest taxpayer in Georgia, where we have invested over $400 million since 2006. Currently, our Georgian assets include a gas distribution network, filling stations, and the Kulevi Oil Terminal and Port. Moreover, there is a network of over 300 SOCAR-branded filling stations in operation in Georgia, Ukraine, Romania, and Switzerland. In 2013, SOCAR placed its first Eurobond issue on the London Stock Exchange, which was positively perceived by investors. The company also delivers oil of Brent quality that is traded on the London Stock Exchange. Besides, SOCAR has representative offices in Georgia, Turkey, Romania, Austria, Switzerland, Kazakhstan, the US, the UK, Iran, Germany, and Ukraine, as well as subsidiaries in Singapore, Vietnam, Nigeria, and elsewhere. Our continued steps toward expanding our foreign activities include the recent acquisition of a 66% stake in Greek natural gas transmission network operator DESFA, which will allow SOCAR to participate in various investment projects in Balkan countries.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bogotá is the economic motor of the nation, generating 26% of GDP. According to President Santos, the city has the lowest level of poverty and disease, and also has the lowest unemployment in the country. What is the contribution of Bogotá's business community to its development?</h4><p>Bogotá is a large city, and it will continue its growth trend over the next 10 years. It is also a highly diverse city with large industrial groups and an invaluable set of small- to medium-sized industries working across various sectors. Bogotá is a stronghold for the financial sector, with 90% of that sector being headquartered here. In fact, Bogotá enjoys the presence of multinationals from all sectors, in addition to the new multinational type called multi-latinas. We have been receiving business migration from the Andean region. The challenges now faced include alleviating poverty and tackling mobility and connectivity. Therefore, we are preparing and helping all small-, medium-, and large-scale companies to be aware of the opportunities of new free trade agreements (FTAs). They will also be prepared for a larger market, and to have quality products to meet the market's demands.</p><h4>How deep is the commitment of the business community to peace and reintegration of FARC and other such groups?</h4><p>The first thing to remember is that this is not the first peace process that we have undertaken. I think the business community was at first wholly skeptical. Yet we have been having these conversations for a year now, and feel this is the moment for peace. Then again, many people prepared for the post-conflict era question whether they are prepared to employ ex-combatants. We have been working with the reintegration agency because this is a long-term project. And it is not just a question of signing a peace treaty, as there need to be alternatives for all people. This process is estimated to require at least six years; hence, we have much to learn in the period ahead. At the Chamber of Commerce, we have been working with the Colombian Reintegration Agency and hiring ex-combatants in subsidiaries, such as at Corferias, or at our university. So far, we have generated around 73 positions. I think that if we want to talk to the business community about hiring, we have to do it ourselves first in order to explain to businesses exactly what they are supposed to do, and how to deal with potential problems.</p><div class="quote">“Bogotá is a large city, and it will continue its growth trend over the next 10 years."</div><h4>What did your 135th anniversary celebration in 2013 signify?</h4><p>I think the most important thing to show after 135 years is that we have been able to work with all governments regardless of ideology, as we are a neutral venue for all businesspeople, representative not of one sector, but of the business community as a whole. Our excellent track record has given us credibility, which we strive to maintain. We have long informed the public sector of business community developments and guided the government when it comes to formulating public policies that can empower the private sector.</p><h4>In 2013 you launched a new model of services for your companies. Amongst your objectives you plan to realize 25,000 “business dreams" by 2017. Could you expand on this?</h4><p>We have to understand that the business community has 340,000 productive businesses in Bogotá. This does not mean, however, that they comply with all the necessary formalities. Many lack technology, and have approached the Chamber simply to comply with the formalities required by law, such as registering with the Chamber of Commerce. However, we observe a very high failure rate among companies in Bogotá. Every six minutes, a company is registered, but only 43% of these survive past three years. It is therefore of the essence that we help them to survive sustainably. We aim to offer a personalized service focused on accountability in bookkeeping and seek to help businesspeople design the best product they can. Our new approach is to visit companies in order to help them pro-actively as opposed to only having them visit us. The numbers might change, because while currently we liaise with 100,000 businesses a year; the number may decline to 5,000. This said, we will be providing a more personal service, in essence becoming advisors.</p><h4>How do you assist companies in keeping up with their contributory obligations and tax issues, and in reducing the costs and obstacles that they incur given the drive to increase tax revenues?</h4><p>This is why an agreement was signed with the IFC. We are collaborating because many fear that if they formalize their business they will have to pay taxes immediately. As very small entities they should not be paying taxes. However, we try to inform them about such issues as transparent bookkeeping with correct inventories, and that they need not be afraid of being in the formal economy. There are a series of benefits to be had from formality. One of them is that the Chamber of Commerce will help them throughout the process, and they will gain experience and knowledge. We have observed that, where people have the opportunity to take formal employment, many immediately do so. Yet many fear having their details on file and resist formalization as long as possible. Therefore we play an educational role, too, pointing out the advantages of having a formal salary to pay for health services, for example.</p><h4>How are you weaving the Business for Peace initiative into the culture of this organization?</h4><p>We are deeply involved in Business for Peace. However, I think it is just starting, and we have to do much more. First, there is information. The business community of Bogotá will receive a significant amount of people once the peace agreement is signed, and the city already has many such people. We have to provide opportunities to create an atmosphere of peace and understanding, as it's not just a question of employment.</p><h4>What achievements has the Fundación Universitaria Empresarial de la Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá Uniempresarial registered, and what are you doing to nurture talent?</h4><p>This is an important new educational opportunity that we have undertaken. The Fundación Universitaria Empresarial de la Cámara de Comercio de Bogotá Uniempresarial is an interesting new model that generates opportunities for all Colombians, regardless of their economic position. It is a German model that involves a five-year career degree that is completed in three years. You start working with a company at the beginning of the program, and start practicing what you learn at university. Participants only have 15 days of vacation per year as they are considered to be working people, and hence shave two years off the course duration. We offer business administration, civil engineering, international finance, and other careers essentially to meet the needs of the business community. Essentially, we are bridging the gap between academia and business. Our university's greatest achievement is producing well-prepared candidates. Many students get hired at the company where they have been interning, having proven themselves good employees with their years of work experience, putting them in great demand.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[offshore-rush]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you elaborate on the role of the Ministry?</h4><p>With regard to promoting the oil and gas sector, we primarily promote all of the available open blocks for foreign or local investment. We normally know who the interested players are, giving them the opportunity to review available data and make their own assessments and judge the value of the block. Then, they put a bid together regarding the proposal to develop it. Than we evaluate the different options and enter into an exploration agreement with the winning company. Thus, our role is to bring more players into the market and make sure all open blocks are commercialized and active. Once a company is on the ground and working, we spend a great deal of time with it to make sure that its management understand the rules and regulations of Oman, as well as ensure they interact with other players in terms of synergy. By way of an example I would cite BP and PDO. PDO supplies BP with electricity and also transports BP gas and condensate, both on a tariff basis. There is also integration with Oman Gas Company, which supplies gas to consumers. BP has a relationship with them, and we entered the relationship as a final custodian of the gas. We also bring them under one umbrella with regards to the In-Country Value (ICV) to create synergies among the various contractors on major supplies of contracts and workforce training and utilization, and such synergies also serve to reduce costs. We also regulate the operators.</p><h4>What were the highlights of 2013?</h4><p>In 2013, I think the major highlight was on the Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) front. It was probably one of the best years for many companies, especially PDO, the largest operator, which achieved the best year ever in terms of incident frequency. The other operators also reported excellent HSE results. Production-wise, I think 940,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) was an excellent achievement: we are going in the right direction Also, from a concession perspective, 2013 saw the signing of a concession with BP following extensive negotiations. We also signed an offshore concession with Total and PetroTel. The year of 2013 also saw positive results from the exploration program conducted by Masirah Oil Limited Offshore. Therefore, offshore is gaining greater momentum, which I consider welcome news.</p><div class="quote">“Safety will continue to be a priority, whether it is people-related or process safety."</div><h4>Can you elaborate on the importance of  $1.2 billion contract for BP's Khazzan project?</h4><p>BP-Khazzan is a major undertaking that translates to production of 28 million cubic meters of gas per day, which is one-third of today's production. By the time it comes on stream in late 2017-early 2018, it will be probably provide one-quarter of what we need in terms of gas. It will also allow us to create a buffer between supply and demand where, for a chain, we will have slightly more capacity to supply gas than there is demand in the market. This buffer provides the required breathing space in which to conduct maintenance, and so on. At the moment, each mishap translates into a shortage for one consumer or another. By creating that buffer, hopefully mishaps at gas plants or fields will not necessarily translate into shortages due to our ability to close that gap from alternative supply. In addition, we are confirming our ability to supply from deep, tight gas fields. Being able to secure that supply will give us the confidence to venture into unconventional gas plays on a bigger scale.</p><h4>Oman recently signed a landmark agreement for natural gas from Iran. What does this milestone mean for gas-intensive industries in Oman?</h4><p>What we have signed so far is a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). There are many things that still need to take place before the project starts registering any milestones. Once complete, it will translate into about 28 million cubic meters of gas. To me, it will bring diversification of supply, which is important because, thus far, we have been relying heavily on our own indigenous gas supply. Of course, there is a small volume being imported; however, it is negligible and destined for Sohar's industry. I think that if the Iranian gas does materialize, it will open up avenues of diversification for gas supply from beyond local production. It will definitely support enhanced oil recovery (EOR) production because EOR projects will demand more gas.</p><h4>How is the Ministry of Oil and Gas facilitating technology transfer to Oman?</h4><p>The ICV index will probably be the one to solve this puzzle. At the moment, we are fine tuning and further developing the ICV index. What the index will allow us to do is establish the ICV any company is generating, be it manufacturing, employment, development, training, or the transfer of knowledge and technology to Omanis and Oman. The index will try to capture a number of these elements, and of course we review local and international companies based on how much of that index they are scoring, either at the start of their set up or as they progress with contracts over the years. With that index, we will do everything we can to make sure that we maximize what the country retains by ensuring that companies score higher on the ICV index. If we can manage it that way, there will be an increased amount of technology transfer to the country, along with many industries setting up in the country, and subsequently a higher Omanization rate. The ICV index will allow us to ensure that when a contract has expired, there is sufficient knowledge, expertise, and industry generated in the country.</p><h4>How would you assess the level of Omanization in this sector?</h4><p>In the oil and gas sector, the number is probably the healthiest. Of course, we have two groups in the oil and gas sector: service provision and operators. Amongst the operators, Omanization is close to 80% on average. The rate at Oman Gas Company for example exceeds 90%, while at PDO it is at about 78%, and at Occidental around 83%. BP is growing because it just started, so it varies among operators. We are struggling somewhat with service providers as the nature of their work is more labor intensive. We need to spend more time on that front developing local capabilities. We take secondary school graduates and diploma holders, and train them to be able to enter the industry with greater understanding and capabilities. The nature of construction is that it tends to rely on more skilled and semi-skilled workers and that, at the moment, is more foreign labor intensive than Omanized. At the moment, under the ICV initiative, we are trying to understand which skill sets most available, and critical in nature, and are focused on creating development programs for Omanis in these skills for deployment in the workforce.</p><h4>What are your priorities for 2015?</h4><p>Safety will continue to be a priority, whether it is people-related or process safety. Another priority is to ensure that exiting gas projects are progressing as planned, because we absolutely need to meet the gas demand in 2017-2018; therefore, we have a greater focus on gas projects. I am confident that we can at least take one step further toward the one millionth barrel.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Where do you currently stand in the market, and what strategies have brought you to this point?</h4><p>Our consistent hard work has earned us the reputation we have in the market. We are known for our quality of work and for our on-time delivery. We always endeavor to avoid any conflicts with our clients as well as our subcontractors. Since its inception in the early 1970s, Almabani has participated in major public projects, mainly airports, roads, and government buildings, as well as military construction. Our Chairman, Nehmé Tohmé, grew this company over the last 40 years with a culture resting on commitment, consistency, and trust. We have been able to cope in periods in which there was a construction boom as well as when the market was depressed by doing our best to preserve our human resources. This is why you can find people who have been working at Almabani for over 30 years, myself included. Our human resources are our greatest asset. We do not have people who come and go; we have people who come and stay. We have always focused on public sector projects, working with the ministries of Defense, Interior, and Transport. One of our main clients is the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA). Almabani has worked on 14 airports around the country, upgrading their runways and taxiways. We have recently built or upgraded three airports and terminals in four regional airports at Yanbu, Madain Salah, Al Ula, and Najran, and we are the second lowest bidder now in Abha. We focus mostly on the airport business, and are known as the main airport contractor. Besides airports, one of Almabani's landmark projects is the extension of roads that cross the airbase inside Riyadh. What brought us here is our consistent pursuit of success in our work, our commitment to our clients to deliver on time, the quality we confer, and the fact that we always do our best to finish a job without any conflicts or litigation, either with clients or subcontractors.</p><h4>There is significant spending on major infrastructure projects at the moment. What makes you competitive in this environment?</h4><p>There are contractors from many foreign companies operating here, such as from Turkey, Korea, China, and Spain. We deal with this is by training our people to ensure that they are up to the task, to seek more efficient ways of performing, and we have become specialists in certain types of work where we think we can have the advantage over other companies. We focus on niche work where we have superior expertise, and where we can perform more efficiently and productively vis-í -vis our competitors. We also ensure that we allocate the necessary assets and resources for our projects so that we are never short of manpower, equipment, or other essentials.</p><div class="quote">“We are one of the top-five contracting companies in Saudi Arabia, with a yearly volume of $1 billion."</div><h4>What are your main areas of expertise?</h4><p>Almabani's focus is infrastructure and roads. We just won the metro project in Riyadh. We are a member of the BACS Consortium of four companies, namely Bechtel, Almabani, CCC, and Siemens. We won $10.1 billion worth of projects out of the total $23 billion for the metro project, so we have almost 40% of the entire metro project in Riyadh, which is a five-year job. We are one of three consortia that share this $23 billion project. For our part of the project, Bechtel, Almabani, and CCC will perform the civil work, and Siemens will manufacture the rolling stock and do the signalization for the project. This project alone has taken Almabani up to a new level. We now compete with international companies on similar large-scale projects. We worked hard to get this project, and it is a significant achievement that will open up new horizons. First, we have to consolidate a deal for the large resources demanded for this project. In the medium term, we seek annual growth rates of 20% to 25%, for the next five to six years at least. In 2013, we grew at a remarkable rate of 70% because of the metro project. We hope to maintain a strong rate of annual growth. Eventually, after a period of consolidation to deal with the volume of work ahead of us, we want to branch out overseas.</p><h4>The mega-projects undertaken in Saudi Arabia will come to completion in approximately five years. Where do you see yourself in 2020 in terms of business and your market position?</h4><p>Right now, we are one of the top-five contracting companies in Saudi Arabia, with a yearly volume of $1 billion, and we are aiming for 20% to 25% annual growth. The construction boom will continue for the coming five years. Once it subsides, and if it subsides, we will look at maintenance and development projects, and also looking at finding new markets in the MENA region.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of Vale's Mozambique operation with respect to its global activities?</h4><p>Our strategy is to grow our core businesses, such as iron ore, coal, copper, nickel, and fertilizers. With regard to coal, Mozambique is our biggest operation and it's a very important project for us. On that account, we are happy to be celebrating one year since our first production. Besides some difficulties with the country's infrastructure, we are happy because we are succeeding. The issues regarding a greenfield project like this are challenging, but the environment in Mozambique is very positive, and the government and society welcome us. Mozambique was our first foray into Africa. The Inco acquisition was a landmark in Vale's international growth, and since 2007 and 2008 we have started to invest here and it has been a good learning process. It's amazing how we are progressing. It is encouraging not only for us, but for other companies investing in the region. We are developing a copper mine in Zambia, and we are also exploring Angola and Congo, for which Mozambique is a good platform.</p><h4>How can undertakings such as the Nacala Project leverage the growth of other sectors?</h4><p>We are carrying out the Nacala Project in partnership with Mozambique Ports and Railways (CFM), and it will surely leverage business for everybody. Vale is investing in infrastructure in partnership with other companies. It's an inclusive project meaning that other companies can have access to it, even in industries such as agriculture, forestry, and public transportation.</p><div class="quote">“Our strategy is to grow our core businesses, such as iron ore, coal, copper, nickel, and fertilizers."</div><h4>What sort of conditions will other companies face to take advantage of the infrastructure that Vale is investing heavily in?</h4><p>We are basing ourselves on international benchmarking in terms of establishing a tariff system, which is important for us to make our coal operation feasible. Of course, infrastructure is linked with mining—reserves of any kind of minerals without infrastructure are worth nothing. For us at Vale, it is important to promote a system that allows us to produce our core, which is minerals, in such a way as to be able to share logistics costs with other companies fairly.</p><h4>What's the projected capacity of your operations?</h4><p>At present, we have 11 million tons in capacity. The bottleneck is the Sena line and the Port of Beira. However, we are doubling our capacity at the mine to 22 million tons. The Nacala Corridor will be completed in 2014, and by 2017 we will be exporting at full capacity. In 2012 we expect to export between 2.8 million and 3 million tons, and in 2013 we will improve on that. We started construction of the Malawian portion of the Nacala-Tete railway in January 2012, since it is the most critical point of the whole corridor. In fact, the distance from Tete to Nacala Velha is 912 kilometers, and of this about 230 kilometers is greenfield.</p><h4>Do you face any difficulties in crossing borders with regard to transport?</h4><p>No. Malawi and Mozambique have signed treaties regarding this matter and we fully trust in them. Besides, we believe that mining operations can serve as an anchor for railways and make them profitable, creating a business lever.</p><h4>What additional investment opportunities will Vale's investment in the Port of Nacala bring to the region?</h4><p>First of all, our investment in the Port of Nacala is to facilitate our coal exports. However, we know that once the infrastructure is there the door will be open to other investments. For example, if you also consider the gas that Mozambique has been discovering, the possibility to build other projects around the Port of Nacala becomes very high when both coal and gas are present. The port is geographically amazing. It is a protected bay and it is deep enough to allow the operation of large vessels. It will be completed early in 2015 in line with the rest of the Nacala Corridor. We are looking at investing about $1.1 billion in the port, while the whole corridor will cost around $4.5 billion to connect Tete to Nacala, including the port.</p><h4>What is the status of the proposed 600-MW thermal power plant at the Moatize Mine?</h4><p>We will probably do it in phases, implementing 300 MW in capacity over Phase I. The design is such that the capacity can be extended in modules. We are investing because it is important for our operation as well as for other demands.</p><h4>How has Vale responded to calls from the government to help develop the Mozambique Stock Exchange by floating 10% of the company?</h4><p>Vale, together with the government, is evaluating the possibility of selling 10% of its shares through the Mozambique Stock Exchange. However, there are other options being considered. More importantly, however, is the need to promote sustainable development. Around 85% of our manpower is hired and trained locally. Being a shareholder, an employee, a supplier, or a neighbor gives us the strength to overcome the challenges that society presents.</p><h4>How has Vale worked with Mozambican companies in Tete since 2004?</h4><p>As part of the first step of implementing activities in the country, we earmarked $1 billion to trade with local companies. We started with a very small number of companies, and the numbers have since been increasing. More than 500 Mozambican companies now supply us in different ways, fulfilling needs for transportation, accommodation, food and beverages, and all other kinds of service support. Also, we try to promote meetings and forums with our main suppliers and contractors and their local suppliers. It is one of Vale's policies to develop its local supplier network.</p><h4>What are your expectations for your Mozambican operations over the long term?</h4><p>We are very optimistic, even though it won't be easy. Investing $6.5 billion is never an easy task, especially with the lack of infrastructure here. However, every day we are improving and we feel more confident in the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) since its founding?</h4><p>The BSE is actually the second-oldest stock market in the region, first established in 1920 by decree of the French commissioner when Lebanon was under French mandate. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a lot of activity on the BSE. Then, the civil war erupted in 1975 and the BSE closed in 1983 until it was reopened in 1996. Lately, the Lebanese parliament endorsed a new Financial Markets Law that resulted in the creation of the Capital Markets Authority (CMA) that aims to regulate and supervise the activities of the capital markets in Lebanon and create an adequate legal framework conducive to the development of the Lebanese financial markets. This new law previews the establishment of a Financial Market Court to adjudicate financial matters, and the restructuring of the BSE with a view to transfer its ownership to the private sector. Recently, in March 2014, the BSE signed an agreement with Euronext, a wholly owned subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange Group (NYSE: ICE), for the implementation of a new trading application platform that supports the expected growth in equity listings and the entry into new asset classes in the Lebanese markets.</p><h4>How successful has the CMA been since its inception in August 2011?</h4><p>After the complete formation of its board of directors in July 2012, the CMA issued a series of circulars and resolutions aimed at regulating the disclosure policy of joint stock companies and mutual funds that have their shares or units traded on the Beirut Stock Exchange or on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, as well as of the firms' obligations in terms of disclosing information to shareholders and unit holders. Likewise, the CMA also issued resolutions relating to the committees, units, and departments that must be met by these companies. These circulars specify that, by September 2014, joint stock companies and mutual funds that have their shares or units traded on the stock exchange or the OTC market, or that have more than 20 shareholders or unit holders, are required to have a compliance department and an internal audit department that shall be autonomous from other departments. The basic functions of the compliance department shall be to ensure the obedience of these companies and mutual funds with anti-money laundering laws and related Lebanese laws and regulations, while the internal audit department shall evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The CMA also issued circulars related to crowd-funding activities and to the requirements to practice specific functions in the financial sector in Lebanon.</p><div class="quote">“We need to become an offshore financial center, a real offshore center with real facilities for foreign companies."</div><h4>Were you able to transition to becoming a joint stock company over the last year?</h4><p>Not yet, no. We started the process and we've been advising the market authority on that, but we've yet to get there. The first step is to get a decision from the Council of Ministers, so they can appoint a Founder's Committee.</p><h4>Besides the necessary laws, do you think there's anything else the government can do to attract more institutional investors to the BSE?</h4><p>All around the globe, institutional investors have come to play a key role in the development of the capital markets. Recent studies show that most institutional investors share a preference for large, liquid, and widely held stocks, with high disclosure standards. Likewise, institutional investors are biased for stocks that are members of a regional or international index. As for Lebanon, we do believe that, in addition to political and security stability, the intelligent levels of corporate governance of listed companies is pivotal in attracting institutional investors to the Lebanese market as institutional investors rely on proper governance to enhance long-term investment returns and diminish risks. We are confident that the creation of the new financial market authority and the series of circulars that have been published and will be published in the future will give national and foreign investors a clear message that Lebanon now has the proper legislation to control and regulate its financial markets, which will help in attracting more foreign institutional investors.</p><h4>In an ideal world, where would you like to see the BSE in a year?</h4><p>I hope that the political and economic situation improves substantially and the country becomes once again truly secure and safe. From the standpoint of foreigners, we have the opportunity to improve and move forward. We need to become an offshore financial center, a real offshore center with real facilities for foreign companies. That's very ambitious, but if the political and economic situation would allow for it, Beirut could perhaps regain its position as a financial center of the Middle East. We'll never have a big enough industrial or agricultural sector, but we could go the way of becoming an offshore finance center. But none of this will happen; the country will not improve until Lebanon has a stable and secure political framework that inspires trust in foreign investors and companies.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[big-input]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main strengths of Baja California as a tourist destination?</h4><p>Baja California is an extraordinary state. We have around 800 kilometers of Pacific coastline and 600 kilometers on the Mar de Cortez, which is known as the “Aquarium of the World." We have stunning mountain scenery and, also, a 200-kilometer border with California, in the US, and 32 kilometers with Arizona. We are also wine growers, and account for around 85% of Mexico's overall viticulture output, having won several awards in 2013. In addition, we offer the best gastronomy tours in Baja California. One can buy a beachfront property for around $1,000 per sqm, located just half an hour from San Diego, the wine country, and the Mar de Cortez. Baja California will eventually have more than 100 resorts and over 20,000 condominiums.</p><h4>What is the importance of Tijuana for Baja California?</h4><p>Tijuana is home to approximately 51% of the state's population and around 52% of the state's economy. It is an international city with an airport through which 5 million passengers transit. We are also building a bridge across the border with the US to serve southern California air travelers. We have seen considerable investment from Japanese, Korean, Chinese, European, and US companies. Today, business is tough and unemployment is at around 4%, but usually Tijuana has around a 2% unemployment print, and it's known as a city of opportunity. Around 80,000 people are returned each year by the US immigration police. Out of that number, perhaps 50,000 stay to live in Baja California, and many in Tijuana. This is a major challenge, but one I believe we can handle. Meanwhile, we have the busiest port/border in the world where, on a good year, we see 50 million border crossings, each way.</p><div class="quote">“Tourism represents roughly 11% of the state's economy and around 8.8% of the jobs in Baja California."</div><h4>What are you doing to attract people from all over the world?</h4><p>Tourism represents roughly 11% of the state's economy and around 8.8% of the jobs in Baja California. Prior to 9/11, we were considered the most visited city in the world, with more than 25 million tourism arrivals annually. The bracero program was also established, which allowed workers from Baja California to cross the border to work in Californian fields. Such links with our neighbor naturally increase interaction between our citizens. Our duty free zones are also attractive for investors, although the new tax structure being implemented will create some challenges. For example, VAT, having risen to 16%, is a barrier to retail activity. Across the border the rate is just 8%.</p><h4>What sectors will boost the regional economy and tourism?</h4><p>Medical tourism is a huge opportunity for Baja California. The quality of our staff and medical professionals is top notch. Most of our doctors are bilingual, and many are bicultural, holding degrees from universities in the US. Aside from that, the film industry has great potential, and we could bring a competitive edge to California through companies filming in Baja California, where, incidentally, we also have a film school. We have a great history in film, and the number of awards local cinema has received is evidence of this. San Diego just closed its film commission and I believe we could work together to rejuvenate it. We are also developing the rest of the state to feature renewable energy, and have a self-sustaining development 68 kilometers south of San Felipe. Tourism is another area of great potential, and we have just recently signed new contracts with cruise lines. Ensenada will be the second most-visited port in Mexico in 2014, and we are poised to build a new port between Ensenada and Los Cabos, which should help the cruise industry in the near future. We are working hard at these projects to make Baja California a world-class destination.</p><h4>What will be the main focus of foreign investment in Baja California?</h4><p>We are the best state as far as labor relations between investors and workers are concerned, and have good relations with the trade unions. We basically have great working relations. This ensures a comfortable commercial environment with a superior return on investment. There is interest from China in our rail system, from Spain in tourism, and from the US in industry, renewable energy, and tourism. Despite tax reforms, we are set to have a strong second quarter in 2014. And looking further ahead, renewable energy stands to become a strong market, to which California itself has made a commitment. Baja California has the best gas pipeline in the country. All of our cities are connected to the natural gas pipeline, which makes our industry competitive. Ensenada hosts the most scientists per capita than anywhere else in Mexico. We also produce more engineers and doctors. A great deal of our budget goes into education, and we offer a range of universities. In terms of infrastructure, we want to build a port in Sauzal, and a rail system to connect Sauzal to Tecate, with a separate line crossing the border, perhaps in 2014. Numerous vehicle-manufacturing plants have expressed interest in this because we could transport the parts from the eastern US and export via the border. Meanwhile, we also plan to build a domestic port for cruise ships in Santa Rosalí­a and a marina in Rosarito.</p><h4>What strategies are you following to address the negative perceptions of security in the country?</h4><p>Security is not an issue today. Six years ago, we experienced problems, in the 2007-2008 period. Currently, that negative perception remains, although in truth we have advanced considerably. The rest of the country wants to implement the strategy that Baja California used to raise its profile. We intend to establish travel alerts that are offered city-by-city, or by region, instead of Mexico as a whole, and we are working together with the US to eliminate this stereotype.</p><h4>What is the role of Baja California, with Mexico's fourth largest city, in the development of the country?</h4><p>According to a saying in Mexico, the south of the country relaxes, the center of the country thinks, and the northern part works. We think and work in Baja California, and our anthem describes us as the country's strong arm. Those who come to live in Baja California are of value to it and to the country. Mexico's interior thinks that we're better protected, but there's no other reason for this than pure old-fashioned hard work.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you looked to adjust your operations in the Panamanian market?</h4><p>AutoStar has been in Panama since July 2012. In 2010, we started with due diligence and market research in Panama, flying in on a weekly basis to get an idea of the operations here. Our growth in Panama has been extremely good because the brand is in very high demand. In terms of the Mercedes-Benz brand, we are working hard every day to improve our service, which is the most important part of our business. The most important aspects include taking care of the client, making sure you have the right parts in stock, and maintaining a training program for our technicians. In this business, you need to have a lot of capital. You have infrastructure that you need to pay for, and then you need to have a lot of stock because clients do not like to wait for their car. The finances also need to be in order as factories are paid up front. When a car arrives in Panama, it is already paid for, and we then sell it two or more months later.</p><h4>How would you evaluate your financial performance over 2013?</h4><p>We had extremely good growth. To improve sales we need to offer competitive prices and good service. And that is the big difference between us and the local dealerships of our competitors. This way, we get an attractive price, and we can transfer that price to the client. We are utilizing this strategy in the first two or three years, as a way of penetrating the market. In the luxury segment, we are always compared with BMW and Audi. In that segment, historically, Mercedes-Benz has a 10% market share. That is too little for this big luxury market. We started in May 2012, and went from 129 units to 365 in 2013. Now, we are experiencing extremely good growth. This is also because clients in Panama are looking for something else; they are looking for better service. When you buy a Mercedes-Benz, you are buying an experience. You are also buying an excellent product and our new products are the best!</p><h4>What models are particularly exciting for you in this market?</h4><p>Mercedes-Benz has changed a lot, and you can now see many new products, including the new generation compact cars (NGCC), namely the A Class, CLA Class, and GLA Class. These models are helping us to attack a segment of clients that we couldn't before. In 2013, Mercedes-Benz was number one in the US after BMW and Audi, and that is because of the new-generation cars. We expect that 20% of our sales are going to be in this area. The Panamanian market, however, prefers SUVs, and 70% of our sales are SUVs.</p><h4>You have presence in five countries. What are your future plans for expansion?</h4><p>We started expanding 23 years ago when we came to Peru. And in 10 years we want to be in Ecuador, Colombia, and Guatemala.</p><h4>What was your financial performance here in Panama for 2013? And what are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>Last year we sold about $45 million worth of products, and we are expecting to sell $65 million this year. We need to have a sale of 900 units across the whole range, which includes Mercedes-Benz, the Chrysler brands, including Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and Freightliner trucks from Daimler.</p><h4>What other investments will you make this year?</h4><p>We're investing around $2 million to give our head office a facelift. We'll then be investing $5 million in new showrooms and our principal workshop for Mercedes-Benz and Chrysler in the Santa Maria Business District. This will afford us the largest workshop in the luxury car segment in Panama. With this kind of investment, we send a hard message to our clients that they can trust us as partners</p><div class="quote">“Mercedes-Benz is all about technology, design, and innovation."</div><h4>How important is the concept of innovation for AutoStar?</h4><p>I think it is an area where Mercedes-Benz is the best, and we are improving a lot. Mercedes-Benz is all about technology, design, and innovation. For example, in the next two years we will have 25 new models from Daimler. That is incredible for Mercedes-Benz. We do not have a competitor that can introduce 25 new products in two years. That is something that Mercedes-Benz is investing a lot in. It is also looking into new technologies for hybrid cars, electric cars, and more.</p><h4>The luxury car sector grew by 19% in 2013 in Panama. What's behind that?</h4><p>I think Panama offers what no other countries in the region do: politic stability, logistics facilities, attractive financial options, and a government and private sector that invest a lot. A lot of international companies are arriving and bringing in managers from other markets. Those managers need cars, so they are responsible for a lot of this growth. But another reason is that the upper-middle class is also growing in Panama. That kind of growth leads to an expansion of the luxury segment. Panama has low taxes compared to the region, making it an attractive place. Also, financing from banks is very aggressive, and people like cars. It's now cheaper to get a car here. Indeed, cars in Panama are cheaper than in the other markets we operate in. The tax rate on cars in Costa Rica is 65%, whereas it is just 25% in Panama.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your economic outlook for Colombia in the medium term?</h4><p>Predicting economic performance in a changing world is a difficult task. Today, we find it hard to believe that the crises of the last two, five, or even 10 years occurred at all; the countries where we have a presence enjoyed sustainable growth. It has been a decade of learning for us, showing that discipline can achieve long-term results. Institutions and regulations have become stronger, with very active internationalization processes under way in the case of Colombia. As well, international corporate capacity has expanded and there is a great potential for economic development. We feel optimistic despite the difficulty in anticipating results in a global economy; however, the world economy will perform better in 2014. Projections made by the IMF in October 2013 point to global growth this year, with the main thrust coming from industrialized countries. Although emerging economies will grow at a faster pace, the former ones will monopolize most of the recovery. The growth rate will increase from 1.2% in 2013 to 2% in 2014. Acceleration is also expected in the US economy in 2014. In 2014, developing countries will continue to grow at a higher rate than the global average rate, as the expected growth will increase from 4.5% this year to 5.1 % next year. However, their performance will be less dynamic than in past years. In Latin America, except for Brazil and Colombia, central banks have decided to cut their intervention in monetary policies to boost economic development. The macroeconomic environment for Colombia now looks more favorable. Labor market indicators, including unemployment and job creation, imports of capital goods, retail, vehicle sales, petroleum production, and construction licensing , among other things, reflect that household consumption, construction, commerce, and credit in 4Q2013 recorded higher levels and are more positive. Inflation is low at the global level, as well as in Colombia. However, I think inflation will pick up in 2014 because, in 2013, it was at 1.94%, the lowest level since 1955. In the US and eurozone, inflationary pressures are also low. In 2014, consumer prices will experience an upward trend in Colombia, ending the year at 3%. This is supported not only by the real recovery, but also by the greater likelihood of an occurrence of the El Niño phenomenon in 2014, the high indexation of the economy, and the increase in the minimum wage this year.</p><h4>What have been the bank's key achievements over the past two years since you were named “Businessman of the Year" by the La República business journal?</h4><p>I started working for Bancolombia in April 1994 and, despite a period of time at another company, I maintained my links as a board member. I was appointed President of Bancolombia in November 2010, officially assuming the position in February 2011. What I was most negatively struck by regarding the banking sector overall was its predominantly complacent arrogance, distance, and lack of respect for the customer, which I was determined to challenge. I, therefore, worked on a strategy geared toward making the bank much more humane and closer to people. This model has become popular worldwide, and many experts are pushing for more human-friendly tools in the financial markets. That strategy led us to issue a public statement declaring that Bancolombia aims to become a financial institution in continuous development based on profitability, viability, sustainability, and with a strong focus on people. We needed to adopt a common language across the organization that, once vocalized, will change the reality. It comes as no surprise that Bancolombia is today the first choice as an employer; we enjoy a reputation for transparency and quality service. These recognitions have come thanks to our commitment to the strategy I just described, and we understand that Bancolombia not only has a financial role to play in the country, but also a social one. This is an important role that I, and the other 46,000 employees of Bancolombia, believe in. At the same time, I have always aimed at making our organization as open as possible; I like to engage with every person involved in Bancolombia's operations, and for that reason I know every detail related to the company. I work around four basic pillars to develop the institution, namely strategy, structure, culture, and technology. We have a long-term vision and, for us, profitability has a strong qualitative component.</p><div class="quote">“We work every day to develop products and services that facilitate access to the financial system."</div><h4>How has your vision guided Bancolombia during these two years? What successes are you most proud of?</h4><p>We work every day to develop products and services that facilitate access to the financial system. We want to develop flexible solutions that save time through events that impact positively on the quality of life of people and realize our humane banking philosophy across the 10 countries where we are present: Colombia, Panama, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and the Cayman Islands. The steady growth of our organization leads us to think about how to be more innovative every day and create great experiences in different ways for our clients, because we are convinced that if they feel close to us, we will be part of their success. To achieve this, the contribution of our more than 46,000 employees is essential; therefore, we want our employees to be happy so they become multipliers of our transformation and action. The humanization of financial business is a big challenge that we must all continue to work on; we must be willing to continue in the search for alternatives for each of our clients so that we can promote different sectors of the population and contribute, from our role as bankers, to reducing social inequality and creating sustainable development. During these years of transformation, we have focused on working with partners, promoting a balance between work and personal life. We want to have happy employees, as we are sure that this will generate customer satisfaction. Some highlights of the transformation include reducing 753 “paperwork steps" to make things more efficient and easier for our customers our employees, while we also continue to favor financial inclusion through “Ahorra la Mano," banking correspondents, our app, which has over 1.1 million downloads, and Bancolombia's online presence, at just a click away. We also implement the telework methodology; we have 368 mobile teleworkers and 193 additional ones. The Bancolombia “For All" program aims to make labor integration a reality for persons with special needs. Today, we have about 20 employees with disabilities. We also sponsor 116 apprentices with cognitive, physical, hearing, and visual impairment.</p><h4>Bancolombia currently has a presence in 10 countries. What kinds of synergies have resulted from the company's many acquisitions?</h4><p>Over the past three years, Bancolombia has implemented a growth strategy with a strong focus on foreign markets. Arriving in new countries poses several challenges, and we always aim for those markets that enjoy legal stability with potential new companies that will create further added value for our shareholders. This strategy led the company to become a leading player in the banking sector in other countries through the acquisition of several banks abroad. At the same time, we face challenges such as creating the right synergies to exchange good business practices, to understand the national culture, and to create job opportunities within the local market, while also integrating local staff within the group's regional strategy. Overall, we are a global company with a presence in 10 countries, serving 9 million clients and with 46,000 employees, and we are a leading player in terms of know-how and innovation, creating synergies to learn from each other in the many markets we are involved in. For example, we exported the idea of the banking correspondent to El Salvador, and in less than one year we already have 60 banking correspondents in the country.</p><h4>What synergies and benefits for stakeholders do you expect from the Banistmo acquisition, and what is your expansion strategy for the future?</h4><p>With the acquisition of Banistmo, shareholders will benefit from adding to the group another link that will provide strength and support to the entire organization. Banistmo is a traditional franchise operating since 1973. Moreover, it is the country's second largest bank—it has a 14.4% share in the loans portfolio—and has interests in all product lines and services. It is a leader in all segments and has a fund of US dollar deposits. Also, it has high-growth potential that lies in a market with strong consolidation opportunities. Similarly, the Panamanian market provides a highly conducive context for the consolidation of Banistmo's activity, since it is an economy with thriving growth projections. Our strategy this year will be to focus on consolidating the recent acquisitions we made, and not only Banistmo, but 40% of Guatemala's Group Agromercantil, too. Note that the organization's assets increased 33.6% after these acquisitions, an increase of Ps32.9 billion. Our goal is to bring a humane banking culture to all the countries where we operate and achieve the highest recommendation from our clients.</p><h4>What has allowed you to become a leader in El Salvador, and what are the peculiarities of this interesting market?</h4><p>Bancolombia has a presence in El Salvador through its subsidiary Banco Agrí­cola, which ranks first in the El Salvadoran market in deposits and net loans, consolidating us as a major market participant and referent. Similarly, our wide range of channels make us a leading competitor. El Salvador has a suitable environment to become a potential market for the banking business; it is the fourth largest economy in Central America with an estimated population of 6.2 million. The economy has a strong focus on manufacturing and services, and in recent years the signing of free trade agreements (FTAs) has increased its international integration. El Salvador enjoys a strategic location for trade between Central America and the US. As part of the process of productive transformation, the country adopted the US dollar as its official currency in 2011. Therefore, the level of inflation and interest rates are the lowest in Latin America. In recent years, the banking system has been characterized by stable and efficient development with a high share of foreign capital. Remittances from emigrants, mainly from the US, are an important source of income for households and account for 16.4% of GDP. For example, in 2012, a total of $3.9 billion entered the country, which represents annual growth of 7.2%.</p><h4>How has Bancolombia's services portfolio evolved since you became president, and how are you adapting to the growth of the region through new products and services?</h4><p>Our portfolio of products and services continues to evolve to offer customers an increasingly timely and simple service. We have successfully added new products to our portfolio, such as Ahorro a la Mano, an easy-to-open electronic account and a key tool to increase financial inclusion; social leasing, whereby tenants pay monthly rent fees, saving on their first down payment for the properties we provide mortgages for; finance leasing for the banking reference indicator (BRI); digital leasing contracts; and others. Similarly, we have ventured into the creation of new payment and service points such as e-trading, Bancolombia's app, virtual credit cards, the Young Card, for internet sales, a PayPass card, which enables low-value purchases without swiping the card or typing in keywords, a Bancolombia card for public transport, a new free miles site that works as a platform to redeem miles from our online site, an Esso Mobil Bancolombia credit card, Bancolombia at a click away, and which facilitates the request of documents, products, and services, while we have also developed partnerships with companies such as Argos and Group Éxito to enhance our banking correspondents channel.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance for Bancolombia of belonging to the elite Emerging Markets Network (EMNet) club of companies?</h4><p>Bancolombia is the first Colombian company to be part of EMNet, which brings together representatives of companies and experts from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and offers the opportunity to promote the exchange of knowledge on topics of interest to generate effective and innovative solutions for customers. Being a member of a forum where we can exchange ideas with world-leading entities allows us to boost our purpose to innovate more and more on the experience of our customers through new ideas and solutions that contribute to the sustainable development of the communities in which we operate. For us, it represents the opportunity to interact with people from different regions of the world to find new options and business relationships that benefit our clients and investors. Being part of EMNet affords us access to a large number of contacts in government and interest groups. These meetings focus on growth in emerging markets, which now account for 40% of the world's GDP and, in about 20 years, this figure will reach 60%.</p><h4>What requirements has Bancolombia had to satisfy to be recognized in this index and what is your vision regarding sustainability?</h4><p>Last year was a good year for our purpose of continuing to generate initiatives that promote sustainable growth in the communities where we operate. Thanks to this, for the second year in a row, we were part of the Sustainability Index and Dow Jones Sustainability Yearbook 2014, which was unveiled by the company Robeco SAM at the World Forum in Davos in January 2014. Each year, this firm, specializing in sustainable investments, invites the 2,500 largest companies in the world according to the Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index to participate in the evaluation. The publication includes only 15% of all providers in each of the 58 sectors of the economy, making it a benchmark for international businessmen and investors. Of the 114 banks evaluated in the world, only 31 were included in this directory; Bancolombia, with 83 points, is one of them. This success encourages us to continue creating spaces that promote the development of society. For example, initiatives such as BanCO2, or Sustainable Branch, underline our corporate purpose. Also, we have been increasingly consolidating the analysis of environmental and social risk to the projects we finance and we have joined such international protocols as Basel III, Global Compact, Millennium Development Goals, Principles of Ecuador, the UN's Principles of Sustainable Investment, and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index with the purpose of being a reliable business partner for our customers.</p><h4>What are the characteristics that allow Bancolombia shares to represent an interesting investment for foreign portfolios based on the management, revenues, and profit?</h4><p>Bancolombia is the leader in its target market—it has a 22% share of the market in Colombia based on assets and 30% in El Salvador as of June 2013—and is an active competitor and increasingly influential player in South and Central America. As an organization with an increasingly comprehensive portfolio, we serve all segments because we have a strong competitive position and a very stable and diversified revenue base. In El Salvador, Banco Agrí­cola has established a leading position because we have a strong franchise, good asset quality, adequate reserves, strong capital, and very good performance. In addition to its contribution to Bancolombia's base line, the company plays an important role in our growth. Bancolombia has a very well-balanced business; with a loan portfolio diversified by geography, industry, product, and debtor. We are confident of our growth in the short and medium term because we are the leaders of a growing market. Banking penetration is increasing, we are diversifying our markets, our goal is cost effective, efficient, and sustainable growth, and we have stricter capital requirements that make us fully compliant with all new financial regulations. We also have countercyclical provisions that enable us to anticipate and shield the institution before potential events; our profitable growth will be leveraged in a diversified portfolio—commercial 19%, individual 25%, mortgage 31%, leasing 16%—and, with assets and a portfolio totaling Ps131 trillion ($61 billion) and Ps90 trillion ($45 billion), respectively, we have the leading banking platform in Colombia and we are leaders in market share. We are the leader in share of total assets in Central America, and this year we will focus on consolidating our investments abroad. Our conservative risk profile brings us sustainable growth in that respect. Finally, our portfolio is properly anchored. Our group is supported primarily by our deposits.</p><h4>Which challenges is the banking sector facing in Colombia?</h4><p>The great challenge of the banking sector in Colombia is financial inclusion. Although we have come a long way, our country is still at the lower level of development compared to other similar economies, and that creates challenges for us to bring more and more people into the financial system. Colombia has high standards in mobile telephony, internet coverage, and the use of alternative channels, and we have eased paperwork processes to facilitate such integration. The good work done up until now only encourages us even more for the future. However, we need to work hand in hand with the government, the real sector, and the community to address issues such as illegal or informal substitutes and improve asset laundering policies and regulatory processes. We must improve financial education and work on the virtualization of money, self-management, and the automation of customers' experiences so they become increasingly positive and thus help us close the gap between the banking sector and society.</p><h4>What was the strategy behind the purchase of Uff Movil?</h4><p>As part of our commitment to innovation, we decided to purchase Uff Movil to better understand the world of telecommunications, especially when it comes to our professional activity and strategies related to mobile banking. We foresaw that the banking system was moving toward a more digital, virtual, and mobile service-based structure. The acquisition of Uff Movil is part of our commitment to be one step ahead in terms of innovation within the sector. I would also like to add that we purchased Banco Agromercantil de Guatemala, Banistmo in Panama, and launched several new products to prove our commitment to be a leading institution in terms of innovation. In this context, I would like to highlight that last year we completed 1.8 billion transactions, 90% of which were performed electronically. We have already registered over 1 million transactions through our mobile application, and we are the only company within the financial industry with a presence in each of the 22 regions of Colombia.</p><h4>What is Bancolombia's commitment to reintegration and the peace process?</h4><p>At the moment, the country is undergoing a complex and difficult process promoted by the government, in which we will all have to make certain sacrifices. We are 100% committed to the peace process. For example, we support the National Agency for Reintegration, as well as a public movement called Reintegration Colombia, which was set up by the magazine Semana.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Colombia's asset management industry is the fourth largest in Latin America. How important is private equity for the asset management industry?</h4><p>Private equity plays a minor role amongst the various investment alternatives in the market. Investments in private equity funds have reached around $1.5 billion, with commitments to reach approximately $3.4 billion. Colombian pension funds have approximately $70 billion under management, meaning that private equity is still a small share of the total. I believe that approximately half of the assets under management (AUM) are in fixed-income instruments, whilst the remainder are divided between assets such as real estate or equities. In fact, pension funds, which are traditionally the largest sponsors of private equity funds worldwide, do face a number of limitations in Colombia. For example, they can invest up to 10% of their AUM in pension and employee funds in private equity. In summary, pension funds have pioneered the alternative investment industry thanks to their investment in private equity funds. Teka Capital forms part of the first group of private equity funds that were born in Colombia.</p><h4>How great is the potential for alternative investments and private equity in Colombia?</h4><p>I'm aware that Colombian pension funds can invest abroad, and they're doing so thanks to a new regulation by which the government opened a larger space for them to be able to invest in foreign funds. However, regarding specific reforms, I believe the private equity industry hasn't been affected unduly. The perspectives for the industry are good. I believe there is important growth potential amongst pension funds, with investors awaiting the results of the pioneering private equity funds in order to judge their performance. US treasury bills have been at historically low levels, as have Colombian fixed-deposit rates, which means that investors have to design new strategies in order to compensate for the lack of return they had been obtaining from their traditional investments. Equities have been highly volatile both in emerging and developed markets, although the former have experienced a boost since the downturn they suffered in the previous year. Private equity funds, as their name implies, are illiquid funds with a long-term focus that are exposed to the lasting performance of the local economy. Their success depends to a great extent on the success of their managers, the price of entry, and on their divestments being made in the appropriate cycle. Having said that, I expect Colombia, an emerging market, to continue growing. In 2013, Colombia's growth was at approximately 3.5% and I expect it to grow by around 4.5% this year. If infrastructure developments are executed correctly in Colombia, I believe we could grow by around 6% as the country has sufficiently strong internal demand to fuel such growth. In addition, Colombia has been developing a very interesting productive sector that may underpin future growth.</p><div class="quote">“Teka Capital forms part of the first group of private equity funds that were born in Colombia."</div><h4>What types of companies are you keen to invest in?</h4><p>We ideally want to focus on medium-sized companies. Colombia is a country in which the middle class is experiencing dramatic growth. Between 2012 and 2013, GDP per capita grew to around $8,000, as a result of which per-capita consumption rates have grown too, meaning greater consumption of household appliances, clothes, food, automobiles, tourism, health services, and so on. Secondly, we expect important infrastructure development and are interested in those companies that offer engineering and other specialist services to related enterprises. In summary, we have carried out four investments. The first company, Color Siete, manufactures clothing and apparel in Manizales. We have an important retail operation with approximately 72 wholly-owned shops and export to Mexico, the US, Peru, Ecuador, and Central America. We own 62% of this company and it is comprised of two brands: Color Siete and Rosé &amp; Pistol. We sell to Bloomingdale's, the upscale chain of department stores, as well as to Barneys New York, the American chain of luxury department stores headquartered in New York City. We also own an 18.7% stake in Bodytech, an investment we made to support the company's international growth. With our support, the company has grown in Peru and Chile and we are naturally looking for new markets in which to expand. It is a great company and we have generated a good amount of added value. In April 2013, we invested in a 47% stake in the Movich hotel chain with 1,100 rooms and are very satisfied with this investment. Regarding hotels, while people say that Colombia is becoming saturated, we still perceive room for development. I believe that Colombia has a lot to do to attract more interest, as this is still a very young market. Whilst Cartagena may be very well known, the rest of the country isn't, and has considerable potential, including Bogotá, Medellin, the Caribbean islands of Sand Andres and Providencia, the Coffee Triangle, and the Amazon. On the other side, the business community is also demanding high-quality rooms with competitive prices. In December 2013, we closed the acquisition of Americana de Colchones and we're looking to close another acquisition in the mass consumption sector. We believe the mattress industry has considerable barriers to entry because of the volumes managed, although we forecast strong growth as the middle class grows. In comparison with our Latin American peers, the per capita consumption rate of mattresses is quite low, pointing to considerable growth potential.</p><h4>What is the nature of your investor base?</h4><p>We have a series of commitments with institutional clients that help us to close the funds. In the Teka 1 Fund, 45% of the investor base is composed of local investors, the Porvenir and Protección pension funds, whilst the remaining 55% is composed of sovereign wealth funds family offices and institutions from Asia, Europe, and the Americas.</p><h4>At Valorem, you managed a portfolio of 18 companies for the Santo Domingo Group, with assets totaling $2.9 billion, achieving a complete restructuring and average internal rate of return of 27.6% in your divestment process. How valuable was that experience?</h4><p>First and foremost we developed a very focused team and our skill sets were very complementary, which made working in the Valorem processes invaluable. I have been working with my partner, Juan Antonio Pungiluppi, for 13 years, a relationship that has strengthened over the years. In fact, we began working together when I was Vice-President of Valorem in 2001.This experience helped us to design a methodology that allowed us to efficiently turn a large number of companies that were unproductive into profitable enterprises. Secondly, we divested a series of operations that were not part of the core business defined with a carefully designed strategy and with very good returns for the holding. We also performed acquisitions that brought important amounts of value for the holding as was the case of TV Cable, where we were able to buy the company, improve its operations, and sell it to Carlos Slim, and Cine Colombia, which is a leading operation in the entertainment industry in Colombia. We always work on having motivated teams, growing our companies, and improving returns. In addition to managing these companies, we were able to analyze over 90 companies, and this experience allows me to state that we have quite a unique knowledge of the Colombian market. I don't actually know many people who have managed 18 companies, $3 billion in assets, restructured $1 billion in debt, sold $2.4 billion worth of companies, bought $360 million worth of companies, and managed to pass from a loss to large profit in eight years.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does GCAA deal with security issues presented by an expanding market?</h4><p>We are the sole agency in the UAE charged with the oversight of security measures at airports and companies. However, we are in close cooperation with other security agencies and the police in the UAE. We have one of the best security systems in the world, and have yet to find any weak points. That being said, we continue to advance and enhance our security so as to always be ready for any type of threat at any time.</p><h4>What is the significance of the recently signed open skies agreement with Finland for the UAE in terms of the movement of people and goods, UAE quality standards, and the local aviation sector in general?</h4><p>We have signed two agreements: one with Central Africa and other regions in addition to the Finnish agreement. We have, so far, signed 160 agreements. The UAE also signed a bilateral accord covering air transport with Mozambique. The agreement will pave the way for airlines to launch services for the movement of passengers and cargo, and will serve as a basis for the growth of trade and investment and the development of partnerships in sectors such as tourism between the two countries. We are looking to plan more agreements because part of our vision is to improve the connectivity of the UAE with the world. There is no use in buying aircraft if you have no flights to operate. I think we can lay the groundwork for airlines, and from there help facilitate their expansion.</p><div class="quote">“We have jointly launched a campaign with other entities to encourage the national and local community to join the aviation sector."</div><h4>What are the main challenges the GCAA faces during this era of increasing partnerships between UAE airlines and foreign operators?</h4><p>Challenges will continue not only for the growth of our national carriers and operators, but also with the increasing demand for our airports from foreign operators. Those foreign operators come from countries that also maintain very high service standards and high levels of safety and security.</p><h4>What initiatives are in place within the GCAA to encourage more UAE nationals to join the aviation sector?</h4><p>We have jointly launched a campaign with other entities to encourage the national and local community to join the aviation sector. The campaign started by visiting schools and offering scholarships to UAE nationals. We have reached almost 30% Emiratization at the Sheikh Zayed Air Navigation Centre, and there is an ongoing plan is to increase that number further still.</p><h4>What does the recent certification of education and training institutions, such as the Gulf Centre for Aviation Studies, mean for both domestic and regional human resources development in the sector?</h4><p>We have many Emirati training centers serving the sector, one of which is the Gulf Centre for Aviation Studies. We are among the best in the world now in terms of providing training in safety and security, and our infrastructure is highly advanced. We are now offering training beyond the region, nas far as Africa and the Americas. We are offering free training for many countries as well. Of course, this training will help us to make sure that wherever our aircraft go, we operate in a safe and secure environment. Internationally, we have agreements with the Latin American Commission to provide training services, as well as an aviation strategy.</p><h4>Do you think that the UAE can be described as a business hub?</h4><p>The UAE is a hub already, and European hubs are moving toward us. We handle almost 10 times our population in terms of passengers. We have a population of around 7 million, and we handle about 70 million passengers; no one else does that. Thanks to our infrastructure, short decision-making cycle, and our geographic location, we have a great advantage.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[we-are-family]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Haji Husein Alireza &amp; Co. developed its business, and what lies ahead?</h4><p>We were established in 1906 as a family company, which we remain to this day. We have also been engaged in a diverse range of businesses. In 1926, we entered the automotive sector, becoming one of the first automotive importers on the Arabian Peninsula. The first car we imported was a Fiat, but shortly thereafter went entered into an agreement with Ford to launch its models locally, too. Over the years, we have come to represent numerous brands, such as Nash and Hupmobile. Until the 1970s, we were also present in sectors such as food and building materials; yet, we decided to specialize in the automotive sector. Today, we prefer to offer a variety of brands that address a diversity of needs. We sell German truck-maker MAN, as well as Peugeot, and we have represented Mazda in Saudi Arabia since 1968. In 2012 we also signed a partnership with Geely, China's largest independent auto manufacturer. We also represent Aston Martin, which should give you a fuller idea of the scope of our automotive offering. Nonetheless, we shun competing products, so as not to cannibalize our brands. We also purchased an IT company called NATCOM, which is a hardware and solutions provider, 15 years ago. It was established in 1978, and is one of the oldest and most experienced IT companies in Saudi Arabia. We provide IT technology and services for both the public and private sectors. We have other businesses that are related, for example, by offering financing to our customers, which has also given us a foothold in the finance market. The nature of our company means that we have a solid presence in every corner of Saudi Arabia, also owning substantial real estate to support our businesses. Thus, by default, we have also become a real estate developer. In fact, one notices that most family companies in Saudi Arabia tend to be diversified into many different businesses.</p><h4>If you could point to one sector today that merits investment for the medium to long term, what would it be?</h4><p>Today, anything that caters to consumer needs has merit, including the retail sector. However, if you are talking about essential commodities, aside from oil, I would pinpoint the construction and housing sector. There is a shortfall between the fast growing population and the housing supply. This situation will not change for the next few years, and therefore the housing market would be the most interesting industry because evidence suggests that demand is not being met. The biggest complaint of all Saudis, be they rich or poor, is the lack of appropriate housing.</p><h4>In the automobile market, Geely is relatively new. How does the market perceive that brand relative to a more traditional one like Mazda?</h4><p>The good thing about the Saudi market is that it is open to all players, as long as they comply with Saudi regulations. This means that a wide variety of car manufacturers are represented here, competing on a level playing field. The good thing about the Chinese brands in general is that they are cost effective, and provide the same features as their competition from the US, Japan, and Europe. Local people are becoming attracted to them as they are very well priced. Now, it is up to the vehicles to stand the test of durability and longevity to establish a loyal customer base. We were actually surprised by how quickly the Chinese established a foothold in our market, and I foresee an interesting future for them. The prices of automobiles have increased over the past decade, especially those of the Japanese and the Korean brands. People who used to buy full-priced Korean products are today buying Chinese alternatives because the Korean products have moved up the market now and stand shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese in terms of features and price. This has left a gap, which the Chinese brands have swiftly occupied. I think there is a very promising future for the Chinese brands as long as they keep an eye on quality.</p><div class="quote">“The good thing about the Saudi market is that it is open to all players, as long as they comply with Saudi regulations."</div><h4>Where do you envisage large family groups in the future once regulatory changes take place to open up the market?</h4><p>Some of the companies listed on the stock exchange started life as family businesses and have evolved that way. I think that the important point here when talking about regulations is that they have to help companies with modest family beginnings to become contributors to the economy. Regulations should help them take the next step to becoming publicly traded companies because such entities contribute to the economy, not just in terms of GDP, but also employment. In order to secure the future and continuity of these organizations, you need to take them away from the non-business pitfalls of being a family company that have the potential to hinder their progress. We need regulations that encourage and reward these family organizations that are important to the economy to help them transform, firstly to ensure their continuity, and secondly to give opportunities to other investors to contribute to their growth.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[sector-landmark]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the strategies that Ahlibank has adopted to deal with the Oman market?</h4><p>Ahlibank became a fully fledged commercial bank in 2008, prior to which it had been a purely retail housing bank. We have established a footprint of 20 branches, having set up electronic delivery channels for internet banking, both for personal and corporate customers. We also have a fully fledged business-to-business (B2B) internet banking proposition. We are about to launch mobile banking services as well. Ahlibank has been growing our assets and liabilities and retaining capital. Overall, 2013 was quite a landmark year for two reasons. First of all, we opened seven Al-Hilal Islamic branches, and now have the largest number of Islamic branches in the country. We also formalized a dedicated SME unit that provides both Islamic and conventional facilities. Ahlibank provides traditional working capital finance and leasing. Customer interest, particularly in our Islamic window, has been highly encouraging. Because we are growing from a relatively smaller base in the country, we grew our loan base three times faster than the sector over 2013, while deposits grew two times faster. Comparatively within the sector, therefore, we are growing rapidly, although the key consideration has been to maintain credit quality, whereby the ratio of our non-performing loans (NPLs) has remained flat at around 1%. Over and above that, it is evolving. We are constantly exploring new propositions for fresh products, particularly in Islamic banking. The Sultanate has a number of government-sponsored projects in the pipeline, which will require the banking sector's support. In terms of the banking sector, the stability and opportunities available within Oman compare very favorably to the wider region.</p><h4>Do you anticipate launching any new projects in Oman over 2014?</h4><p>We are about to launch mobile banking applications, and also introduce an Islamic credit card. And with the increasing acceptance of Islamic products, we are set to introduce more. We were one of the first banks to launch an Islamic investment fund in 2013, called Al Hilal. It invests in Islamic operations and companies throughout the region. Perhaps one of the biggest gaps in the market right now concerns Islamic banking. We have two dedicated Islamic banks in the country and most of the other banks have set up an Islamic window, which means they conduct both conventional and Islamic business. There is significant deposit generation going on within the Islamic banking sector, but not too many opportunities to invest with Islamic compliance. Many commentators expect that the government will issue a sukuk in 2014, and that we will see some of the companies involved in major projects either issuing sukuks themselves, or else project bonds, because there is considerable liquidity that is being invested overseas that can be tapped within Oman.</p><h4>What are your competitive advantages?</h4><p>One of our advantages is that we have a fit-for-purpose branch network. We open branches in those areas where we foresee demand. Thus, our branch network expansion has been prudent and well planned. Some of the upcoming areas of development in the country include Sohar, Duqm, and Salalah, where we have operations. Through our strategic investor, Ahli United Bank, which owns 35% of our shareholding base, our clients have access to the Group's footprint across seven countries in the region, plus the UK. This gives us the opportunity to support our customers in Oman when they expand abroad, and equally those customers from the region who are looking to move into Oman. We are a local bank, but with a regional presence, which is unique. Over and above that, we are growing quite quickly compared to the market. That gives us the advantage to be aggressive in certain areas and focus on customer service.</p><div class="quote">“The banking sector as a whole seeks to allocate a minimum of 5% of lending activity to SMEs."</div><h4>What is the importance of mobile banking and e-banking in Oman?</h4><p>We have built in-house a B2B electronic platform that enables customers to perform such tasks as payroll payments, remittances, and reconciliation. This is in addition to our personal internet banking service. We do see increased awareness and interest from both retail and corporate customers in such electronic channels, and we consider the investment in such services to be very important in the years ahead. Mobile banking is a new feature within Oman, and we are about to launch our own mobile banking application. However, it remains important to provide banking services through traditional branch and ATM networks, particularly in terms of savings and investments. For example, in Oman, when individuals seek investment advice, more often than not they take advice from family members.</p><h4>How do you support SMEs financially, and what are the related challenges?</h4><p>The banking sector as a whole seeks to allocate a minimum of 5% of lending activity to SMEs. In addition to purely lending money, banks seek to support SMEs through providing sound advice on business fundamentals, through seminars, and workshops. This is both an opportunity and a challenge for banks in the sense that many banks have only recently started to focus upon the SME segment. This said, all banks appreciate the requirement to support SMEs, both for the generation of employment and the benefits that SMEs bring to the broader economy.</p><h4>What is the main contribution for SMEs in terms of finance?</h4><p>We see considerable demand from customers on the leasing side of the business regarding equipment—construction equipment, for example. On the one hand, we are focusing specifically on leasing equipment and, on the other we are focusing on more normal working capital provision. We have developed a credit approval policy tailored toward SMEs as most will not have three or four years of audited financials to provide. So, instead of looking at that and analyzing as you would do for a large corporate, we have other criteria to consider and evaluate. We also have a dedicated unit with professionals from within the industry whom we have hired to take this proposition forward.</p><h4>Is the Ahlibank Group planning to expand its presence more?</h4><p>While we will continue to expand organically, the bank will continue to look for good acquisition opportunities, both in the countries where we already have a presence and in the countries where we do not. We are a regionally focused group, and consequently this is where our appetite lies for growth.</p><h4>As the new CEO, what are your personal targets for 2014?</h4><p>I would say that continued sustainable growth is our aim. We want to grow the balance sheet, but we also want to keep NPLs in check. The metrics we challenge ourselves on are return on equity (ROE), return on assets (ROA), and to be best in class in terms of cost efficiency, which is currently the case. More specifically, we will build out our SME business and continue to develop our Islamic window. Meanwhile, we also want to provide our employees with the best working environment possible, and our new head office serves as a prime example. We strive to ensure that our colleagues enjoy a level playing field for career development, and we promote on merit. We want our colleagues to have meaningful, long careers with the bank and serve as ambassadors. I think our focus on customer service is the overriding consideration, however, this year. I am highly optimistic about the opportunities for the banking sector in Oman as there is a stable, well-regulated economy that is open to foreign investment. There are also many expansion projects—roughly OMR10 billion worth of projects over the next five years, which will require the banking sector's support. Furthermore, the Sultanate is establishing strategic logistics centers, such as Duqm and Sohar, as well as new airports, ports, and railways. From that perspective, Oman is a country in which banks should continue to perform well.</p><p>© The Business Year - May 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In May 2013, the 12 Colombian banks reported a profit of Ps2.49 trillion, while in the same period of 2012 that figure was Ps2.17 trillion. What's the reason behind Colombia's banking strength nowadays?</h4><p>The Colombian banking system has a very efficient regulatory framework that has allowed the optimization of the bank's role in society. Colombia suffered from a severe financial crisis in the late 1990s, which led to reforms in the regulatory organ of the financial system, bailing out many banks and establishing more efficient regulation. The country also improved the monitoring and supervision of financial institutions operating in the country and the market itself. Today, we have a very robust financial system in terms of the supervision and monitoring of banking activity. Additionally, the Colombian economy has been steadily growing for the last 12 years, and keeping in mind that Colombia has a very strong domestic market, the country is in a good position to overcome possible adverse economic situations. Besides, confidence in the country has increased significantly, and this has boosted both domestic and foreign investment. Therefore, the current situation of the banking system in Colombia is due to the efficiency and the favorable economic conditions the country enjoys.</p><h4>How would you assess recent developments in Colombia's agricultural sector?</h4><p>Risks in rural Colombia are not only financial, but environmental and social, too. Even though we have significant problems in the countryside, I feel very optimistic about Colombia's economic growth, particularly the development of agricultural sector. Colombia is a very diverse country when it comes to landscape and climate, which makes agricultural activity vulnerable to harsh weather conditions, a sector in which the Colombian economy is strongly focused on. Also, there are other international scenarios affecting our agriculture sector, such as the prices of commodities. However, the future, once the crisis is over, is brighter for the Colombian agricultural sector. We are heading to the most ambitious infrastructure plan ever in the country, which will be focused on the construction of roads, railways, and ports. This will make our country more competitive and agricultural production will be driven to the international market in a more efficient way.</p><div class="quote">“We see entering the mortgage segment as a way to take advantage of the extensive geographical presence of the bank in Colombia."</div><h4>What strategies has the banking sector implemented to boost banking penetration in remote areas of Colombia?</h4><p>The country has over 70% of its population concentrated around urban areas, and 52% of these people live in either large or medium to large cities. Therefore, banking services and activities focus on these areas, where people tend to have regular and stable income, as well as a proven credit quality. In this context, rural Colombia has some of the worst social development indicators, such as increased poverty and low banking penetration. Banking intermediation costs are high and reaching these areas is, in many cases, not profitable at all for banks. However, there have been some policies to reduce these costs from the government. As per Banco Agrario de Colombia, we have 742 bank branches and 6,400 banking correspondents. We are a banking institution with a presence in areas where no other banks can be found, such as rural Colombia. We have 500 branches located in towns where there are no other banks. At the moment, we are working on a strategic plan with the Ministry of Telecommunications to boost banking penetration in remote areas of the country, while also increasing the availability of banking services to these communities. In our particular case, we have also developed specific products targeting rural Colombian citizens in addition to implementing a very aggressive banking penetration strategy in rural Colombia. Reducing costs and implementing very specific programs, such as credit cards with particular benefits for small farmers, are examples of those new products. Also, we are a very active player in the government's subsidies plan and we have nearly 3.5 million clients who are part of this plan, something we complement by offering financial education and opening bank accounts for these people as part of the financial inclusion plan.</p><h4>What other strategies do you have lined up to continue increasing banking penetration in Colombia?</h4><p>We have a very ambitious plan to open 1 million Banagraritos accounts, in which we will bring banking services closer to children whilst teaching them the benefits of having a financial history in the future. We would like to boost the savings culture among children in rural areas, as they are the future of the country. We also want to develop a program for teenagers aged 18+ for them to access financial services, creating special conditions for them to access to their first credit.</p><h4>What are the challenges ahead of the industry?</h4><p>The banking sector in Colombia faces a technological challenge to migrate its current services to the digital world. Also, the sector needs to further expand and diversify its product portfolio, for this is a very demanding industry that increasingly requires tailor-made solutions. We believe the banking sector has to play a major role in driving the development of rural Colombia.</p><h4>What is the future vision you have for Banco Agrario de Colombia?</h4><p>Banco Agrario will play a major role in the post-conflict period in Colombia. The bank has a presence in 720 municipalities, and in over 500 of which we are the only financial institution operating. At the rural level, we are Colombia's bank of choice, and we aim to strengthen our position with more branches and offices. We believe that rural Colombia, along with the agricultural sector, has huge potential for development and we prioritize agribusiness development, as well as small and medium farmers. The bank also has to further strengthen and diversify its product portfolio.</p><h4>Regarding product portfolio development, what plans do you have for the mortgage market?</h4><p>We see entering the mortgage segment as a way to take advantage of the extensive geographical presence of the bank in Colombia. However, we do not plan to cover all the products and services of this market. We will focus on the existing products, in order to encourage people to stay and thrive in their rural areas rather than leave their natural environments for urban areas.</p><h4>What relationship does the bank have with the major agribusiness groups of the country?</h4><p>We take part in large agro-industrial projects around the country through loans and other types of credit; however, we do it along with other big banking institutions in Colombia. Additionally, we are also considering the possibility of entering into infrastructure investment projects in the country as Colombia has one of the lowest levels of infrastructure in rural areas in the Latin America region. This has a negative effect on the level of competitiveness and efficiency in the agriculture industry. Finally, we also support the Ministry of Agriculture to develop regional policies more relevant on the national level, and that generates more value-added and helps to boost agricultural exports using different tools and policies.</p><h4>How has the bank contributed to the government's plan to address the lack of housing in the country?</h4><p>Estimates show that there is a shortage of 1.9 million housing units in urban areas of the country, whereas in rural Colombia, this figure climbs up to 2.3 million. The government has implemented policies and plans at both the urban and rural level. Our institution, using funds provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, manages the plan at the rural level. These funds are made available to municipalities, which extend it to the lower ends of society in rural communities. The Universidad Nacional de Colombia plays the role of external agent to analyze the applications made by municipalities. From there, it continues under a particular framework to make these funds fully available. Up until now, we have provided housing units in around 599 municipalities, 66,875 have been contracted, and 42,072 have already been handed over. In this context, we are contemplating the possibility of granting productive loans to the families that have been awarded these houses, because they usually have enough land to operate productive agricultural activities or other related business activities.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the purpose of the acquisition of Seguros Colonial in 2010?</h4><p>The group saw an opportunity to acquire the biggest company in the country, so the main driver behind acquiring Seguros Colonial was to enter the market in a leading position. We are a multi-risk company and operate in all lines of business except life, because we do not have that license yet. We hope to get a license in the next six to eight months. We think we have a good opportunity here, and we hope to receive an adequate return on the investment we made two years ago.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand your operations in 2013?</h4><p>We have a couple of business lines that we want to develop more aggressively in Ecuador. One is in the transport-related business. We want QBE Seguros Colonial to grow at a rate of over 25% in 2013, and we want to develop our SME offerings. Also, we are planning to continue our geographic expansion across the country over 2013. We are expecting to open three additional offices in Machala, Puyo, and maybe Quevedo. The first two are now in the opening process.</p><div class="quote">“The first thing you have to do is be transparent, and this is the basis to play a role in social responsibility."</div><h4>What are your aims for the market in Ecuador?</h4><p>It is not a developed market, and in some cases the market participants did not put the right price on the risks they covered. But it is normal that the market will re-adjust at some point, especially as we now have more multinational companies in the country.</p><h4>Do you have any connections with other countries in the region?</h4><p>Yes, as part of QBE Group, we interact with the other QBE companies. We also have quarterly meetings with all our CEOs in Latin America, where we share experiences and products and we have some programs that are looking for more interaction between our teams across the region.</p><h4>How many employees do you have?</h4><p>Currently, we have 354 employees; however, over 2013 we expect to increase that number to 400.</p><h4>What role do you play in supporting the agricultural sector?</h4><p>QBE Seguros Colonial is the only company that sells policies in this sector. We have 15 years of experience selling our products, but the premiums are still low. In 2012, we recorded about $3.5 million in premiums, and in 2013 we expect to grow to maybe $4 million in premiums, so it is a very small business. We hope the government will offer more support to the agricultural sector in the future because normally this kind of product requires subsidies. If you charge a 6%-7% margin to farmers, they cannot do it because they are very small and Ecuador is a small country. We are going to continue in this market because we have experience and we have the right technical team. It is a policy type that requires unique expertise, which we have.</p><h4>How does QBE Seguros Colonial differentiate itself from the other main insurance providers?</h4><p>In 2012, we carried out a survey of our customers and the clients of other companies. One of the attributes our clients found is that we are a company that pays claims, and this is one of the biggest differences that clients perceive. We have the largest coverage in the country, and a good service structure.</p><h4>What will be the impact of new insurance regulations on your company?</h4><p>We have a stronger position in terms of technical reserve levels, so we do not see any material impact of the new regulation on us. However, some smaller companies may suffer from the changes. We believe that any regulation that makes companies have adequate reserves is positive. We are a company that has the highest reserves in the country. In the long term, the market will have fewer companies. There are more than 40 companies in Ecuador and many of the smaller companies will not meet the future capital requirements. Some will merge, and some will be sold.</p><h4>What role does social responsibility play in your company's activities?</h4><p>The first thing you have to do is be transparent, and this is the basis to play a role in social responsibility. Also, you have to create a good environment for your workers. If you have happy employees coming to work, you have a good company and it provides better service. QBE Seguros Colonial offers policies for the low-income segment providing coverage to a group that in the past did not have any coverage. We put an adequate price on that type of risk.</p><h4>What do you foresee in the coming years for the insurance sector?</h4><p>In the last five years the growth of the Ecuadorean insurance market was in double digits—15%-19%—and we expect that the insurance market will maintain a growth level over that of GDP, so we see good opportunities to continue developing our business.</p><h4>Is there a place for new investments in this sector?</h4><p>Yes. For example, we think that in 2013 we will receive an additional capital contribution to the company to finance our business growth, so our shareholders are giving us signals of confidence that they will continue investing in the country. From my point of view, there are not a lot of opportunities for acquisitions in Ecuador. You have to wait to see if the small companies have the adequate level of reserves before you analyze the potential for acquisition.</p><h4>How do you think the sector will grow?</h4><p>For example, life insurance is less than 30% of total premiums for the country. If you see other countries in Latin America, the relationship is normally 50-50. There is the potential for growth in the life sector. This is the cycle in all countries. In Ecuador we are starting to see this cycle and we have to take advantage of that, but reforms to the life and pensions sector are required.</p><h4>Are your clients mostly corporates?</h4><p>QBE Seguros Colonial has all kinds of clients. We have corporate accounts and individual accounts. We are the leaders in auto insurance, meaning we have a lot of individual policies. In some lines of business, such as cargo, we are the third company, but those are normally corporate clients. We are the biggest company in the country in property, and those are mostly corporate clients as well.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2013</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since Citibank has been operating in Ecuador for over 50 years, how has the bank contributed to the development of the country?</h4><p>Citibank started operating in Ecuador in 1960 with a clear goal: facilitate trade activity between Ecuador and other regional countries through our large branch network. In this context, one of our main focuses over the years has been local and multinational corporate companies in Ecuador, as well as the other markets in which we operate; we provide them with the right tools to develop their business activity, which enables them to take advantage of the synergies between Citibank branches in several countries. The government and the institutional sector is another one of our main focuses of activity. All in all, I think Citibank has contributed to the development of Ecuador from several points of view by providing finance tools to companies operating in the country, bringing in international banking practices and standards, boosting technology and know-how transfer, and playing an active role in the professionalization of the banking industry. Finally, we have also adopted a very active role when it comes to social responsibility, engaging with activities to boost financial education and entrepreneurship in Ecuador.</p><h4>What would you say is the significance of Ecuador within Citibank's global activities?</h4><p>Citibank Ecuador belongs to Citibank Latin American operations, and due to the fact that we have local clients operating at the regional level and regional/global clients operating in Ecuador, I would say that the country plays an important role within the company's global operations. Citi provides this global footprint to our customers. Ecuador is also a relevant market for Citibank due to the fact that it is a developing economy with very attractive growth rates and trends over the last few years.</p><div class="quote">“The banking system in Ecuador has a very strong technological platform."</div><h4>Who are the main clients of Citibank Ecuador?</h4><p>We have a combination of local large corporations and multinational foreign companies operating in Ecuador. Regarding the corporate segment, most of our clients are large global or regional companies with operations in Ecuador. We also work very closely with clients from the professional sector, such as banks, and the public sector; we have a close working relationship with the Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and other such institutions.</p><h4>How does Citibank integrate social responsibility into its activities in Ecuador?</h4><p>We establish strategic alliances with leading foundations that have the capacity to reach a wider spectrum of society. We provide funding and volunteering to these strategic alliances, creating a very close link between our workers and these activities. We have a strong focus on activities related to financial and banking education, as well as entrepreneurship and business management education, implementing activities that simulate the daily activity of banks, companies, and the stock exchange, among others. We believe that financial and banking education has a very important long-term impact on communities. Regarding entrepreneurship initiatives, I would like to highlight the “Entrepreneurial Women," program, which provides technical training and support on the implementation of their business ideas. This program has the unique goal to boost entrepreneurship among women in Ecuador. All in all, we believe in the need to support micro companies, and for that reason we have several strategic alliances at the international level with leading institutions to provide financing and training tools to these kinds of firms.</p><h4>How would you characterize the way technology is integrated into the banking system in Ecuador?</h4><p>The banking system in Ecuador has a very strong technological platform that is the result of increasing efforts within the last few years by banking institutions in the country. Market demands have clearly boosted the presence of the latest technologies in the sector, and banks implement continuous investments in this regard. As per Citibank, the main differentiating point is that our technological platforms comply with international standards, and we apply the same platform in Ecuador as we do in much larger economies and markets across the world. In this context, security levels are extremely high in our platforms, avoiding fraud or theft of information, for example. Also, our platforms are very user-friendly. In this context, I would like to add that we have been labelled as the best bank in cash management services for the last six years.</p><h4>What are the advantages of working with Citibank for an international investor coming to Ecuador?</h4><p>We have a presence in 160 countries around the world, and we have a unique footprint across the globe. Therefore, Citibank Ecuador can provide its clients with the much-needed connections and financial tools at the local and international level, while also adapting our products and services to their needs. Another thing I would like to highlight is that our current clients (multinational companies) know that our practices and platforms are standard regardless of the country in which they operate—it is very easy to operate with Citibank once you have the experience regardless of the country you are in. Also, we can provide our clients with a large list of connections as well as market experience and knowledge thanks to our presence in many countries. Finally, and despite having a local banking market dominated by local companies, I would say that Citibank also has vast experience in Ecuador, although we are a foreign player. We have the same level of experience and knowledge of the local market as any local bank can have.</p><h4>What segments of the market you identify as the ones with the greatest potential for the growth of Citibank in Ecuador?</h4><p>We have a strong market target: the corporate segment. In this context, current economic growth trends in the country and the ongoing support from the Ecuadorean government for the expansion of the corporate sector means that they will further need banking tools for their development, and Citibank will be there to provide them with the best tools. In this context, Citibank is to play an active role in the government's efforts to change the production matrix in the country.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Citibank's operations in Ecuador for the next few years?</h4><p>We aim to continue operating as a leading player in the corporate segment, while further differentiating ourselves from the competition thanks to the service to our clients; we will continue offering customized services and tools that best fit their needs and demands. We will further invest in technological platforms to continue being an innovative player in this field, and we see interesting opportunities within the public sector, as Ecuador continues growing.</p><h4>What makes Ecuador attractive to the eyes of international investors?</h4><p>Ecuador has experienced very interesting and dynamic growth rates over the last few years—it has undergone a significant transformation, positioning the country among the leaders in the region in terms of growth. In this context, such growth trends have been consistent and regular, and that means many growth opportunities for foreign investors. All in all, I think potential revenues when investing in Ecuador are higher than those in other regional markets, and the government's efforts to change the production matrix of the country will mean many interesting investment opportunities for foreign investors.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>NR Finance México is the leading company in the financial segment of the automotive sector in Mexico with a 26.4% market share. What is the secret behind your success?</h4><p>NR Finance México's success came with the growth of Nissan in Mexico; we are the captive company for Nissan, Renault, and Infiniti. We have been growing together with the OEMs during a period in which many new opportunities emerged within the automotive sector. In the finance segment of the Mexican automotive industry, three main players can be identified: banks, consortiums, and captive companies. After the financial crisis, we saw many banks exit the sector, creating many opportunities for companies such as ours. In our particular case, we grabbed the opportunity to increase our market share and that of our brands. We focused on the dealer network to increase both volume and penetration. All in all, that strategy led us to a very successful period, whereby we increased our customer base in Mexico. In this regard, over the past few years we have also created loyalty programs to reward our long-term clients and create a sense of uniqueness.</p><h4>What is NR Finance México's strategy to increase customer satisfaction?</h4><p>This is one of the biggest challenges faced in Mexico. Mexican customers have grown more sophisticated over the years, and their satisfaction does not depend on getting a loan from our company alone; they require complementary services, too. For example, we bolster regular communications with our clients throughout the loan period in order to acquire a better follow up on the customer's needs after receiving the loan. In this light, we established our certified contact center area focused on Nissan, Renault, and Infiniti customers that has grown to become the leading such center in the country. What's more, the loyalty program we have implemented gives us a clearer idea of those clients returning to us to meet their financial needs, allowing us to provide them with special products and promotions.</p><div class="quote">“We see a huge potential for the automotive sector to increase sales volumes."</div><h4>How would you evaluate the performance of your new products over the past few years?</h4><p>We have several offers and promotions month by month based on our customers' behavior, market trends, and seasonality. In this context, we always try to personalize and adapt our products to the customers' needs. For example, we launched a month of free insurance for one of the most popular cars in Mexico of the last 25 years, which helped us to increase penetration levels from around 20% to close to 40%. We also have products based on each type of vehicle, meaning they also adapt to the type of client who purchases the vehicle. I should mention that the customer's profile in Mexico varies greatly depending on region. NR Finance México is very much aware of that when it comes to the products and services in its portfolio.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about your partnership with Nacional Financiera (Nafinsa)?</h4><p>A large proportion of our clients are SMEs, a segment of the market in which we work closely with Nafinsa, the governmental bank of Mexico. It provides us with very valuable support to have a stronger position in this particular segment. For example, we offer a special loan for SMEs to help them purchase a fleet of vehicles to carry out their business activity. Thanks to Nafinsa's support, we are able to offer reduced interest rates on our loans as well as smaller initial down-payments, as well as other types of facility. In fact, we have gained more than 55,000 such SME contracts since working with Nafinsa, a partnership that has lasted over two years.</p><h4>What is your growth strategy for 2014?</h4><p>We have signed more than 324,600 active contracts over the last 10 years. As a very large captive company for Nissan, Renault, and Infiniti, we want to further increase our presence in the market, for we have products that appeal to all types of people. In this context, we have a special interest to become a stronger player in the fleet segment of the market. Additionally, we believe that there are some interesting opportunities in the subprime segment of the sector, one in which very few financial companies currently operate. Finally, we will also continue working in the further specialization of the company in certain regions of the country.</p><h4>What is your general outlook for the sector in the next few years?</h4><p>We see a huge potential for the automotive sector to increase sales volumes. The year 2013 saw the volume reach 1.1 million units; however, the potential is much higher than that. I also perceive great potential to increase the number of cars manufactured in Mexico. In this regard, Nissan opened its third production plant in the country in October of 2013, and we should keep in mind that cars manufactured here are exported to as many as 100 different countries. However, I believe that the government still needs to amend certain local regulations in order to boost domestic sales.</p><h4>How would economic reforms in Mexico impact your business activity?</h4><p>One of the government's main economic reforms was to increase the availability of credit to both companies and individuals, the aim of which was to increase loan recovery options, which benefits financial companies. Legislation regarding the provision of loans is set to change, whereby there will be more relaxed requirements to access credit lines. It is also planned for the credit bureau to become more transparent and make information public, meaning that we will be able to assess customers much better by knowing their levels of debt and credit history.</p><h4>Mexico has the potential to produce 4 million cars per year. What are your views on that, and what are your future goals in this scenario?</h4><p>We are very much linked to the development of the automotive sector and our strategy should focus on how we would like to support vehicle sales in Mexico. Our loans are focused on creating an additional customer base for the market and supporting the sale of vehicles. We expect to see an increased volume of both production and sales in Mexico over the next few years. Currently, our penetration with Nissan is 46% and 57% with Renault. Our main object is to increase those figures, especially for Nissan vehicles, where we target the 50% level. Nowadays, one in every four vehicles sold in Mexico is a Nissan, and in the financial segment of the sector, one in every four Nissan vehicles sold in Mexico is purchased through our company. We do not set any limits in terms of growth and our goal is to improve our current business performance and service to expand our activity. Regarding Infiniti, we currently account for 68% of the brand's total sales in Mexico, of which 80% are made through leasing, a segment we also want to expand in the near future. I believe the used-car segment is set to bring us very interesting growth opportunities. All in all, I think we have the capability to increase our market share to 28%.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the purpose of the acquisition of Seguros Colonial in 2010?<br></h4><p>The group saw an opportunity to acquire the biggest company in the country, so the main driver behind acquiring Seguros Colonial was to enter the market in a leading position. We are a multi-risk company and operate in all lines of business except life, because we do not have that license yet. We hope to get a license in the next six to eight months. We think we have a good opportunity here, and we hope to receive an adequate return on the investment we made two years ago.</p><h4>Do you have plans to expand your operations in 2013?</h4><p>We have a couple of business lines that we want to develop more aggressively in Ecuador. One is in the transport-related business. We want QBE Seguros Colonial to grow at a rate of over 25% in 2013, and we want to develop our SME offerings. Also, we are planning to continue our geographic expansion across the country over 2013. We are expecting to open three additional offices in Machala, Puyo, and maybe Quevedo. The first two are now in the process of opening.</p><h4>What are your aims for the market in Ecuador?</h4><p>It is not a developed market, and in some cases the market participants have not put the right price on the risks they covered. But it is normal for the market to re-adjust at some point, especially as we now have more multinational companies in the country.</p><h4>Do you have any connections with other countries in the region?</h4><p>Yes, as part of QBE Group, we interact with the other QBE companies. We also have quarterly meetings with all our CEOs in Latin America, where we share experiences and products and we have some programs that demand more interaction between our teams across the region.</p><h4>How many employees do you have?</h4><p>Currently, we have 354 employees; however, over 2013 we expect to increase that number to 400.</p><h4>What role do you play in supporting the agricultural sector?</h4><p>QBE Seguros Colonial is the only company that sells policies in this sector. We have 15 years of experience selling our products, but the premiums are still low. In 2012, we recorded about $3.5 million in premiums, and in 2013 we expect to grow to maybe $4 million in premiums, so it is a very small business. We hope the government will offer more support to the agricultural sector in the future because normally this kind of product requires subsidies. If you charge a 6%-7% margin to farmers, they cannot afford it because they are very small and Ecuador is a small country. We are going to continue in this market because we have experience and we have the right technical team. It is a policy type that requires unique expertise, which we have.</p><h4>How does QBE Seguros Colonial differentiate itself from the other main insurance providers?</h4><p>In 2012, we carried out a survey of our customers and the clients of other companies. One of the attributes our clients found is that we are a company that pays claims, and this is one of the biggest differences that clients perceive. We have the largest coverage in the country, and a good service structure.</p><h4>What will be the impact of new insurance regulations on your company?</h4><p>We have a stronger position in terms of technical reserve levels, so we do not foresee any material impact of the new regulation. However, some smaller companies may suffer from the changes. We believe that any regulation that requires companies to have adequate reserves is positive. We are the company with the highest reserves in the country. In the long term, the market will have fewer companies. There are more than 40 insurance companies in Ecuador, and many of the smaller ones will not meet the future capital requirements. Some will merge, and some will be sold.</p><h4>What do you foresee in the coming years for the insurance sector?</h4><p>In the last five years, the growth of the Ecuadorean insurance market was in double digits—15%-19%—and we expect that it will maintain a growth level over that of GDP, so we see good opportunities to continue developing our business.</p><h4>Is there a place for new investments in this sector?</h4><p>Yes. For example, we think that in 2013 we will receive an additional capital contribution to the company to finance our business growth, so our shareholders are giving us signals of confidence that they will continue investing in the country. From my point of view, there are not a lot of opportunities for acquisitions in Ecuador. You have to wait to see if the small companies an adequate level of reserves before you analyze the potential for acquisition.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your company's most significant developments of late?</h4><p>We have been developers for 24 years, which means that we are deeply engaged in the conceptualization and structuring of projects, as well as their management, and sale. We do not undertake architectural design or construction, but rather hire architects, contractors, and builders. We have undertaken a wide diversity of projects in the past that range from hotels, office buildings, and housing developments, to residential clubs with golf courses, warehouses, shopping centers of all kinds, and medical centers, among others. We are particularly proud of having created the Hotel Santa Clara in Cartagena. When we purchased it back in 1990 it was a ruin; in fact, it was built back in 1621, making it almost 400 years old. We have since transformed the old convent into a beautiful, six-star establishment. The other project we are very proud of is the Central de Carnes Guadalupe, located in southern Bogotá, and which is a meat distribution center serving up to 44% of the city's 8 million population. From the outside it resembles a shopping center, although in reality it is a total of 116 shops that sell meat. It is hygienic, organized, and well designed. Another project we have completed in Bogotá is a large shopping center on Avenida 26.</p><h4>What were the main challenges that you faced in securing a leading position in the sector?</h4><p>In the construction sector of the economy, the main problem that we traditionally faced was the lack of government commitment to an effective legal framework. You would plan a project under certain rules and tax regulations but, all of a sudden, without announcement, the rules would change. The other thing is that, in the past, the investor was a very strange breed because of the violence that the country was suffering. Colombians were in the habit of keeping their money abroad in foreign banks. Banks had the highest interest rates, which is what the construction industry greatly depends on. First, a developer must obtain construction loans to build a project, where interest rates are the most important consideration determining whether a family can afford your product or not. This has changed considerably, however, and, while we still have abundant credit and loans priced too high when compared to other parts of the world, business is still doable. Today, we are securing loans at an interest rate of below 10% per annum, whereas not too long ago the construction business had faced interest rates of over 48% per annum. At such rates it is is impossible to conduct any business. The other novelty is the trust that both foreigners and Colombians alike have in the country today. This has made it possible to attract considerable foreign investor interest in Colombia's economy. Furthermore, there are many Colombians investing in the local economy, which is very good news, having broadened the horizon for the property business.</p><div class="quote">“We are deeply engaged in the conceptualization and structuring of projects."</div><h4>What are your expansion strategies for the near future?</h4><p>We are teaming up with private equity funds and family offices from abroad. We put together the first project four years ago with Avenida Capital, a fund from New York. We developed an excellent relationship and are now working with other funds as well. These provide the significant capital that each of our projects demands. In 2012 we had four projects, and in 2015 we will have nine projects underway. That doubling of project number requires abundant capital, which today is available at suitable interest rate terms, or else which we obtain in the form of equity. We now choose between loans for construction, or equity, and sometimes we opt for a mix of the two.</p><h4>Can you comment on the current interest rate situation in the market and your projections for the future? What can your company offer foreign buyers?</h4><p>Interest rates, although much higher in the past, are now at between 7% and 8%, and as high as 12% per annum, depending on who is doing the borrowing. This is still too high, and inflation this year will be very close to 2%, which makes this scenario untenable. Inflation is one of the basic elements that leads to improved interest rates. One should bear in mind that for the first time, the middle class is acquiring housing or real estate. When a middle-class family considers buying a home, it looks more at the monthly payment than at the price of what they are buying. Everyone in the business knows that the amount is more sensitive to interest rate movements than the actual term of the bank loan. This is revolutionizing our economy. For example, the airline industry is growing at a rate of 18%-20% per annum in terms of passengers, but not in revenue terms. This has been the case for the past four or five years. It is very difficult to find a country anywhere else in the world that for five or six years is growing by 20% in terms of passenger number. It tells us that the livelihood of many people has been improving to the extent that they can today afford purchases formerly unavailable to them. This is very important for the real estate business, and tells us that now we need to focus not on making projects for the rich and super-rich, but rather tap into the burgeoning middle class market.</p><h4>What leads you to believe there is no bubble in the residential real estate market?</h4><p>I don't think we have a real estate bubble in Bogotá, although we certainly do have a distortion due to the lack of building land available amid prevailing uncertainty over legal zoning. This has kept capital and companies away, redirecting them to develop cities in other parts of the country. We are seeing outrageously high-cost products, especially in the north of Bogotá, which suggest that there will have to be an adjustment in the long run. When more land becomes available, prices will drop. My recommendation to my friends is not to buy now, but rather to lease or rent.</p><h4>Where do you identify the best property investments in Colombia?</h4><p>I would say that the best opportunities are located on the Caribbean coast, and that in the future potential lies in Buenaventura on the Pacific coast, the port of which handles over 60% of Colombia's international trade. New roads and highways to Buenaventura are now being laid, and I believe it will enjoy a very bright future, especially thanks to the recently signed free trade agreements (FTAs). Subsequent development should be concentrated in Santa Marta, Cartagena, and Barranquilla. Around 80% of our projects are located in that area, as they sell faster and local authorities seem to better assist entrepreneurs complete their deals. On the coast, I see opportunities for logistics projects and warehouses. I also perceive a need for office space in Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Santa Marta. There is opportunity in the residential segment for all buyers, from lower to upper segment, in all three cities. There is still some room for growth in commercial, especially mixed-used projects, and also for second homes, especially for foreign nationals. Over the past four years we have been trying—despite no success to date—to have a law passed along the lines of that passed in Panama around eight years ago to attract foreign investment in real estate.</p><h4>Can you share your vision of the Colombian economy and the role that infrastructure projects play in it?</h4><p>Colombia has much potential in mining and especially in energy. We will remain self-sufficient for at least the next seven years thanks to sufficient oil and gas, one of the largest coal mines in the world and an abundant water supply to generate electricity. In terms of energy, which is a key factor of future global development, Colombia is one of the richest countries on the planet. In terms of agriculture, the potential is even higher. Colombia is one of the few countries in the world with millions of as yet unused hectares that can be allocated to agriculture. And so while most countries have already fully exploited their land, Colombia today is making use of less than half of what it has. We also have access to high-quality technology. Yet a key factor here will be the social aspect, and specifically the peace talks currently underway. These are important for both Colombia and the wider region.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Johnson &amp; Johnson (J&amp;J) in Panama and what has its growth strategy been here?</h4><p>One of the first regions in which the company decided to expand its international businesses was Latin America. The first country in which J&amp;J set foot in Latin America was Mexico in 1930 and after that Brazil and Argentina followed in 1937. We started operations in Panama through the acquisition of McNeil Laboratories in 1959. J&amp;J comprises three major sectors. People know more of J&amp;J through its consumer business, but the biggest sectors of the company are the pharmaceutical and medical sectors. In terms of strategy, one of our pillars is to grow in emerging markets, and that is where we play a very important role for our corporation.</p><h4>Which are the most in-demand products in Panama?</h4><p>We have a well-established business in Panama for the three sectors. For the consumer, our biggest brands are Johnson's Baby, Listerine, Lubriderm, Splenda, Tylenol, and Carefree, and we have recently launched one of our global star brands, which is Neutrogena.</p><div class="quote">“I believe that the key for the success of our products, brands, and organization stems from our purpose."</div><h4>What has been the key to the success of your products?</h4><p>I believe that the key for the success of our products, brands, and organization stems from our purpose, which is to enable our consumers and patients to live longer, healthier, and happier lives. This inspires us to give our best every day, and represents also a responsibility to deliver the best quality products and solutions around the world. This is also perfectly aligned with our credo, which is a set of values that guide our decision making. Our credo was written by Robert Wood Johnson in 1943, long before anyone ever heard the term corporate social responsibility. We believe it's a recipe for business success.</p><h4>Which country in Latin America represents the largest source of income for J&amp;J?</h4><p>Our biggest operation is our Brazilian consumer company, which for the consumer sector is the second largest operation in the world. This is a very exciting year for us and for our Brazilian operation even more, since we are sponsoring the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which we all know will be held in Brazil. We also have big and important operations in Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico, among others. In Panama, we have one of the highest market shares in most of the categories in which we compete, and last year Panama was the fastest-growing country in the region. Our operation in Panama is very important for us, because we have well-established and strong brands, a very strong team, a solid logistic infrastructure, and a great environment to do business, which are all essential to build a successful and profitable business.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the level of innovation and infrastructure in Panama?</h4><p>I believe Panama is becoming an example for other countries in the region. The level of progress in different sectors of the economy that you see and the improvement in infrastructure are famous. Panama is world class in transportation and logistics and financial services, but is also progressing at a fast pace in other sectors such as tourism, health, and construction. Internally, we are working to capitalize on all those strengths that Panama is offering. We are taking advantage of the logistics capabilities the country has to offer to be able to operate more efficiently with other countries in the region. One other example may be a new digital application for our Lubriderm product line (SunStop by Lubriderm), which helps people understand the risks of sun exposure. We were very impressed by the level of support we received from different health institutions (Funda Cancer, Hospital Oncologico, and Asociacion de Dermatologos), as well as many other stakeholders.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the importance of public-private-partnerships in Panama's health sector?</h4><p>There is a positive alignment in general between the public and private sectors. To give you an example, the Minister of Trade and Industries, Ricardo Quijano, has invited the presidents of companies from various sectors to discuss how the government can help us to grow in Panama. The most positive aspect of these meetings is the fact that we can actually see the government moving in the directions that are good for the country's development.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Panama in 2014?</h4><p>We continue to experience consistent and strong growth in Panama. We foresee that this trend will continue in 2014 and in the years to come. When we analyze internally how to allocate our resources, Panama always comes out as a top choice.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

With which other authorities will the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) share its experience?</h4><p>The RTA is sharing its experience in implementing DGEP requirements and criteria with many governmental entities such as DEWA, the Dubai Police, the Dubai Municipality, and Dubai Customs. This is an annual practice that the RTA will continue depending on the requirements of each authority. In addition, RTA holds regular meetings with its strategic partners regarding its external communications plan and a culture of excellence is embedded within these meetings. The RTA also participates in the annual best practices forum, where all government entities present their case. One of the purposes of the DGEP is to share best practices between government entities in order to improve the overall performance of the governmental sector, and one of the indicators that shows the effectiveness of the program is the improvement in overall customer satisfaction across all Dubai government entities from 74% in 2007 to 87% by end-2012. That said, there will always be room for improvement across each standard metric and the RTA will continuously ensure that improvements are implemented.</p><h4>A tram system is being developed in Dubai. How will this complement Dubai's underground rail and bus infrastructure?</h4><p>Dubai Tram will be serving some of the city's economic nerve centers, which are at the heart of its tourism trade. The tram services will complement the Dubai Metro Red Line through the direct linking of Phase I of the project with two Metro stations, namely Dubai Marina station and the Jumeirah Lakes Towers station, respectively, to provide the safe and direct transfer of passengers between the two modes of public transport. The public bus services will be integrated with both Dubai Tram and Metro services through either the urban bus lines, or feeder bus routes, which are designed to provide the most seamless travel to remote destinations. According to the planned schedule, Phase I of the Dubai Tram project will be completed with commercial operations to commence in November 2014. The Board of Directors of the RTA endorsed the award of a contract to construct four covered and air-conditioned footbridges for Dubai Tram users—two bridges will also be constructed over Al Safouh Street to serve tram users and residents on both sides of the street, while the other two will link the Tecom zone with the locality on the opposite side of the street, as well as the Dubai Marina Mall, thus providing safety for pedestrians.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai Tram will be serving some of the city's economic nerve centers, which are at the heart of its tourism trade."</div><h4>What other projects are you planning in order to improve customer service in the public transport sphere?</h4><p>Apart from said footbridges, the RTA is planning to integrate the tram route with the nearby Palm Monorail system by constructing a footbridge linking Palm Jumeirah tram station with the Palm Monorail terminal station at the entrance of Jumeirah Palm area. Such a linkage will provide for the convenient integration of the Palm Monorail service with the public transport network within Dubai and help improve overall customer satisfaction among public transport users. The RTA is currently in the process of tendering the Dubai Metro Red Line connection from Sheikh Zayed road to the Expo 2020 site near Al Maktoum International Airport. The planned connection will serve existing and future developments beside the Expo 2020 site along the proposed route. The line is planned to be in service by late 2019. Other planned public transport projects will include the Green Line extension, which will extend the current services of Dubai Metro Green Line to the newly developing suburbs of Lagoon, International City, Silicon Oasis, and Academic City. The total length of this extension is 21 kilometers featuring 11 stations. The extension of the Red Line from the Rashidiya district to the Mirdif area is also a future rail project.</p><h4>The Green Bus is the leading environmental sustainability project launched by the RTA in cooperation with S.S. Lootah and the UNEP. The RTA has in place a strategic plan to broaden the scope of the experiment to span 60 buses over the next three years. How are you applying the plan, and what is your approach to the environment?</h4><p>This is a strategic project of the Public Transport Agency (PTA), to be implemented by the maintenance and services departments, and involving the use of B5 biodiesel on 60 buses starting from 2014 to 2016. To the 11 buses already running on biodiesel, 10 will be added in 2014, and 40 in 2015 and 2016. The RTA has other initiatives to support environmental sustainability, which include setting the air-conditioning temperature inside buses at 24 °C, which has already been implemented on 517 buses. We also have a new initiative, which involves automatic bus engine shutoff after five minutes at a bus stop or station in order to reduce idling time, fuel consumption, and gas emissions, a system that has recently been implemented on 10 buses.</p><h4>The RTA recently held its 45th Customer Council session. What were the conclusions of this event?</h4><p>Customer Council gatherings are always held with the aim of gauging the RTA's customer needs, views, and suggestions to improve the service offering. They also open new horizons and add to the RTA's third strategic “Customers First" strategy, particularly as we provide more than 206 diversified services through multiple channels including our website, and customer service centers, among others. This warranted us to respond to customer feedback in a timely fashion, and to take opinions on board in all our current and future initiatives toward improvement. Constructive suggestions from the public included providing NOL Card vending machines, which the RTA has already installed at certain bus stations, while a study is underway to have them installed in others.</p><h4>What are the main challenges that Expo 2020 will bring to the RTA?</h4><p>The RTA does not consider Expo 2020 to be a challenge, but rather a great opportunity and another significant addition to its excellent record of hosting and managing major international events such as IMF and UITP meetings, among others. In fact, the timing of the announcement that Dubai would host Expo 2020 could not have been better, since the RTA is currently undertaking a project to update strategic and implementation plans related to transportation for Dubai, which will develop integrated transportation projects and policies necessary to cope with the forecast urban and economic growth of the Emirate, including developments and activities relating to Expo 2020. The study is currently in the data-collection and transport-survey stages, which aim to better understand travel behavior within Dubai and between Dubai and the surrounding Emirates. This study aims to produce integrated long-, medium-, and short-term road and public transportation plans for the Emirate of Dubai until the year 2030. In line with this, the RTA is also working on the preparation of a detailed Expo 2020 Transportation Master Plan, which aims at identifying the detailed requirements of the event in terms of the transportation infrastructure, systems, and initiatives needed to serve the Dubai Expo 2020 site during the event and after it.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The construction sector grew 10.8% from January to September 2013. How would you assess the development of the sector regarding public infrastructure?</h4><p>The figures are quite impressive indeed. We finished 1Q2013 with over 10% growth, followed by more than 8% in 2Q2013, and a unique 24.8% in 3Q2013. These impressive figures made the construction sector the leading economic engine for the country during this period. For example, in 3Q2013, the second fastest sector in the Colombian economy was agriculture with over 6% growth. In this context, housing played a very important role. Colombia generated attractive incentives for companies, ramped up investment, constructed over 100,000 free housing units, and reached 1.4 million workers in the sector. Colombia's construction sector is now positioned at the forefront of the region and positively contributed to lowering unemployment in the country. In fact, Colombia has generated the most employment in the region on a per-capita basis. During Pastrana's administration, the country built 280,000 housing units, while during Uribe's first administration it built 340,000, and in his second administration 560,000. With Santos, we plan to finish with 920,000. This represents an 80% increase compared to the previous government. In 2013 alone, we built 260,000 housing units, representing an all-time record for the country. This activity has not only contributed to the development of the construction sector, but other related sectors, too.</p><h4>What are the government's plans regarding free housing?</h4><p>We have an integral housing strategy reaching all levels of society, especially the low-income segment, where informality is still high and poverty, although reduced, is still a major issue. The current level of informality in our economy has reached 49%, and that means that millions of people do not have access to formal credit lines. Our government offers these people real possibilities to access the housing market through the free housing units program. In 2014, we will complete 60,000 housing units for this segment of the population. Additionally, we have set up a parallel program for families that have between one and two salary sources and are still vulnerable in economic terms, despite their formality. They receive a subsidy of around Ps15 million, plus another one linked to the interest rate, meaning that we assume between 30% and 40% of the interest generated from a mortgage for these families. Finally, we have also developed plans for the middle class, especially linked to, again, the interest rate and lower tax payments for those who purchase a housing unit. We have noted that such policies have contributed to further boosting activity in the construction sector. We have seen the sector developing positively and believe it has a bright future.</p><div class="quote">“We have implemented very important investments in drinking water infrastructure."</div><h4>How have public-private partnerships (PPPs) contributed to this strategy?</h4><p>When developing our strategies and subsidy programs, we aimed to make both buyers and constructors feel comfortable, making sure that they realize we are on their side by reducing bureaucratic processes, among other things. For example, in the 100,000 free housing units, the investment is 100% private and we choose the developers based on their proposals. We select people that fit the parameters for access to this kind of housing and we offer guarantees to constructors. In the second program, we again choose developers and they are also the ones who decide on the final buyer based on their economic background. With such projects, we have boosted the number of PPPs.</p><h4>How would you assess the work being done to improve access to drinking water?</h4><p>We have implemented very important investments in drinking water infrastructure and, today, thanks to our work, 4 million more Colombians have access to drinking water for the first time. Now, we need to further invest in rural aqueducts to increase access to drinking water, while also improving sewage systems across rural areas. That would also boost industrial activity in many areas and create more jobs.</p><h4>How well shielded is Colombia from a real estate bubble?</h4><p>We do not have such a deepening of the mortgage credit sector as, for example, Spain, a country that suffered from a real estate bubble. Our deepening of the mortgage credit sector stands at 5.1% of the country's GDP, while in Spain that figure reaches over 50%. Also, Colombia enjoys excellent risk management standards as compared to other countries, and we do not give mortgages to those people who have to allocate more than 30% of their income. In addition, we only concede mortgages between 50% and 70% of the value of the property. We also have to mention that, in Colombia, we only construct housing projects when all the units have been sold. These are just some examples. Additionally, Colombia's credit default level stands at 2% nowadays. However, we see an increase in prices because of the rising purchasing power of Colombians. Also, the increasing number of foreigners willing to purchase a house in our country is leading to higher prices in the market.</p><h4>Where would you say lie the best investment opportunities for foreign developers and constructors?</h4><p>I think the fact that both Colombian and foreign players compete at the same level is a clear tool that attracts foreign companies to the sector. That has led to a current scenario in which many foreign companies develop construction projects in our country. In fact, I think housing, port, and tourism construction are very attractive sectors with great development potential.</p><h4>How are increasing levels of security contributing to the revival of certain areas such as La Candelaria in Bogotá?</h4><p>Public security for our citizens has positively increased during both this government and the previous one. Additionally, more employment and higher investment in security, health, and education have also contributed to reducing poverty and violence. In this context, Colombia has come a long way and, although we still have a lot to do, we have to be very proud of what we have achieved.</p><h4>What is the level of commitment of the Ministry to further generate more employment opportunities in the sector?</h4><p>In December 2013, we reached the highest number of employability in the sector ever, at 1.4 million people. If we take into consideration the 21 subsectors that benefited from the growth of the construction sector, the figure goes even higher. As investment continues to flow, and as transparency and formality levels continue to increase, so will employment opportunities. Also, we are working to further strengthen the real estate service sector and formality levels in it, for we have already achieved a great regulatory framework.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the main achievements of the Ministry since it was founded five years ago?</h4><p>Our Ministry is rather young and has just 100 people working in it. The core reasons behind its establishment were the importance of new technologies and the information society in the development of Ecuador. Some of our top priorities back then were the modernization and upgrading of certain institutions linked to the sector, such as the Civil Register, which deals with the identification of Ecuadorean citizens, Correos del Ecuador (the national postal company of Ecuador), Corporación Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (the public telecommunications corporation of Ecuador), and the National Register of Public Data, among others. Therefore, we can proudly say that the Ministry has become rather iconic within public administration, having performed vital tasks in this sphere. We have eradicated many problems and barriers of the past in official institutions. In this context, many people see the evolution of these above-mentioned institutions as symbolic of national development over recent years. We have updated services, boosted technology, and changed old patterns. In sum, I believe that we have achieved much over the past five years, leading key transformational processes for Ecuador through innovation and our flexibility as an organization. The central government's decision to establish the Ministry of Telecommunications and Information was a positive one.</p><h4>How have these achievements impacted the economy?</h4><p>According to available data, we have achieved a significant change during a period of unprecedented growth for Ecuador. Internet penetration rose from 6% to almost 70% during this period when we went from being the bottom country in terms of broadband access to topping the table, according to US research. We currently have the fastest internet in the region at 3.6 Mb/s. Overall, our work has been constant and steady, as we had to create all the infrastructure and then provide services that today are available to Ecuadorean society. In another example, five years ago there was only 3,000 kilometers of optic fiber in the country, whereas today the figure has reached 35,000 kilometers.</p><div class="quote">“We have a nationwide broadband plan targeting SMEs, as we know that many of them do not receive sufficiently high-speed internet."</div><h4>What has been the Ministry's approach to improving access to technology in Ecuador, and what programs have you implemented to achieve this?</h4><p>We have implemented many nationwide programs to democratize technology services such as internet access. In the past, only the wealthy had access to such services. We have changed that by providing free training and infrastructure, and today all citizens enjoy access. For example, we have created the so-called “Info Centers," spaces to provide training, equipment, and tools to democratize internet access in Ecuador. Today, we are nearing 2 million visits to these centers in a country of 14 million inhabitants. In this context, we have seen a boost in entrepreneurship among citizens of rural Ecuador thanks to these Info Centers, and they can now utilize the network to advertise and sell their products by leveraging the infrastructure that we have installed. Approximately 500 such centers have been established nationwide. Additionally, we have seven mobile classrooms, whose main aim is to reach remote areas of the country to provide internet training and access to people living in remoter areas, which tend to be those on the lowest income. This program received international recognition for its efforts to build an inclusive system for new technologies. Over 250,000 people have already benefited from this program. We have also established the School Connectivity Program, the aim of which is to interconnect all public schools across the country by setting up a special lab within the school with computers and internet access. Currently, 7,000 schools are connected, while at the beginning of our term there were none. Our goal is to reach 9,000 schools by the end of this government's term. Also, we have already started providing schools with Wi-Fi areas for students, staff, and even parents. So far, the eight largest public schools in the country already have Wi-Fi, and we aim to ensure that all public schools across the country become Wi-Fi spots. This project, alongside the two I mentioned before, impact as many as 5 million people in Ecuador. In this context, one of the main successes of these projects is the involvement level of local communities. For example, in the Info Centers project, the communities themselves are the ones that provide us with a place where we can set up infrastructure, rather than us having to look for it.</p><h4>Would you say that Ecuador could serve as an example for other countries that want to democratize access to technology?</h4><p>I think anybody can learn from anybody else nowadays, and certainly we have learned from the experience of neighboring countries. We know that Colombia has a similar project to our Info Centers, however; they also show movies there. This is something we went on to implement here in Ecuador, too. Additionally, we have also taken this particular project to the next level to allow us to reach underprivileged citizens in urban areas. We created our first “Mega Info Center" in the suburbs of Quito, with an infrastructure six times larger than average Info Centers in rural areas. In this new phase of the project, we will target the urban areas of Ecuador, because we know this kind of infrastructure will boost e-government in the country. Finally, I would add that through such successful projects, we boost the development of the private sector. This is why, in the case of the community Info Centers, the connectivity has been provided by the public enterprise CNT EP, highlighting its social commitment with the provision of equipment and connectivity for the purpose of fostering the democratization of the technologies in order to build an information and knowledge society. In some cases, we have received support and the services provision from private enterprises.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's priorities for 2014 and onwards?</h4><p>We have structured and organized goals for the near future; for example, we have a nationwide broadband plan targeting SMEs, as we know that many of them do not receive sufficiently high-speed internet for their professional needs. Our goal is to reach the end of the government term with internet access nearing 99%, so we can catch up with what is available in developed countries. Current trends indicate that this will be possible. We are also studying the possibility of tendering a 4G license for a new operator in the country based on sector development. Currently, there are three players in this area, and studies suggest that demand will grow 16-fold over the coming years. Ecuador, therefore, clearly has sufficient potential to accommodate a fourth operator.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The much-awaited reforms in the Mexican telecommunications sector were passed into law in June 2013. What are your expectations?</h4><p>This is the first time that there has been a reform that deals with the different issues needed to create changes in the telecommunications sector. The barriers to entry in this market have not budged for many years; they have existed for a long time and have made competition difficult. This reform does contain the necessary changes and establishes asymmetrical regulation. This involves treating the incumbent differently. This altered treatment demands that access has to be provided on an equal basis and at a reasonable cost with a prompt delivery. The new legislation also eliminates exclusivity regarding suppliers of terminals and on contracts that are frequently negotiated based on the incumbent's size and power. For example, I am referring to the providers of smart hones that give the incumbent a window of two or three months, a period within which other service providers cannot have access to those phones and therefore suffer a competitive disadvantage. Exclusivity concerns also distribution, and there are many ways that distribution chains can be forced to give the incumbent exclusivity, such as contracts designed so that commercial chains obtain a greater retribution if they allow only the dominant firm to distribute its services. It also refers to the provision of the last mile to competitors by the incumbent. This last issue has always been a problem. All these elements have been considered in the constitutional reforms. These reforms will certainly break the monopoly in Mexico, but in order for this to be implemented in practice and have the effects desired by the President and congress, we need bylaws that ensure the implementation of the constitutional reform, and that has not yet happened. It is expected to take place over the course of the next few weeks. It is critical that these bylaws include elements that mirror the intent and content of the constitution. If the goals of the constitutional reforms are to be achieved, the bylaws must support and guide the resolutions of the new Institute of Telecommunications (IFETEL)</p><h4>What kind of a timeframe are you looking at?</h4><p>We cannot really say how fast the commission is going to act; its members could start right away or they could take their time. We will have to wait and see, as the processing of the bylaws through congress faces a number of hurdles: there are other priority reforms waiting to be considered, such as the tax and energy reforms. A reasonable time frame is December of this year.</p><div class="quote">“Being the first to introduce innovations is a true advantage in this market."</div><h4>How has the company managed to win a 20% market share?</h4><p>It has been a combination of factors, but key among these has been the construction of a network that has national coverage and can provide excellent quality of service. When comparing the performance of the different networks, ours invariably ends up on the top in terms of speed and reliability, and it is also top in terms of quality of service and geographical coverage. We have also been creative in designing campaigns and products that are attractive to our customers; we have tariffs and products that are quite original—and frequently copied by others. By the time our commercial innovations are copied, we are generally ahead in the acquisition of customers. Another innovation that we have been able to achieve is in technological progress and the ability to introduce it. For instance we are the first and only ones to have introduced voice messages that are automatically converted into text. We were also the first to introduce value-added services in our smartphones. Being the first to introduce innovations is a true advantage in this market, and it is how we were able to get a foothold.</p><h4>What kind of innovations are you looking to introduce next year?</h4><p>We have just begun promoting a wireless internet service designed to be installed in 20- to 40-story buildings that offers full coverage within the structure, without cables or wires. We are also using a model copied from Indian telecom systems, which consists of inviting people who are willing to invest in extending services to remote rural areas. The investors take the commercial and credit risk, and we connect our network with their structures and share the income. We have already had a few successes and we are exploring more remote areas every day.</p><h4>What is your view on the transfer of technology from Spain to Mexico and the future of machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies?</h4><p>We are certainly involved, but it is still a challenge we have to surmount regarding the large Mexican corporations. At the most basic level we are providing GPRS services and data transmission on ATMs. There are many applications that we are working on in terms of these possibilities. Telefónica does research in the UK on the latest technology for end-to-end applications. As an example of technological deployments, we are the only telecommunications provider in Mexico with a wireless signal within Mexico City's subway; others cover only the stations.</p><h4>How does Mexico fit into Telefónica's operations within Latin America?</h4><p>We are comparatively small in relation to the size of the market; our revenue is about 11% of the wireless market. That is exceptionally small, but we are relatively larger if you consider other criteria. We have 20 million customers and a very large investment in the geographical area that makes us larger than other medium-sized firms in the telecommunications industry. However, we still have a long way to go if we want to become true competitors.</p><h4>What are some of Telefónica's main CSR activities in Mexico?</h4><p>The Telefónica Foundation helps children who would have to leave their studies in order to work. We are broadening its scope at the moment, and the corporation would like to be able to reach a much larger number of children. We currently attend 30,000 children directly, which is a small number if you consider the size of the problem. We are therefore doing more to support them through technological methods and specifically through smartphones and tablets, especially for learning mathematics. Many video games use advanced technology, and children are actually learning while they use these. We want to build on the knowledge that these children already possess.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of the measures taken to stop the financial crisis?</h4><p>I would assess the success of the measures that we took as the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to intervene in the banking sector as quite high. This is evidenced by the fact that the banks are stable and largely profitable, although our primary focus is on the stability of the banking system, not bank profitability. The profits are a business priority that is left to the banks to pursue within a framework set by the regulatory system. The reason why I bring up this distinction is because it's subtle, but important. There are certain measures that we take, and have to take as regulators, that we are aware will affect the profitability of the banks, but we take those measures because it is in the longer-term, broader interest of the economy and financial system, especially when it leads to stability. For example, the increase in the cash reserve ratio of public sector deposits. If you have a number of banks being highly exposed to public sector deposits, that poses financial stability risks because we are an economy that depends largely on crude oil for its revenues. If anything happens to the price of oil, then the government will have serious liquidity problems and the banks become unduly exposed to a decline in government deposits. We do not want this to happen. We increased the cash reserve ratio for public sector deposits from 12% to 50% when monetary conditions required such a policy, then from 50% to 75% at the last policy meeting. This matter of banks' exposure to public sector depositors is one of the things that contributed to the near collapse of some of our banks in 2008 when the oil price crashed, along with the excessive exposure to the oil and gas and public sectors, which created problems for those banks. It is a macro-prudential approach in a sense, and we have an eye on stability. We know that in the short term it will affect the profits of banks, but it is necessary for those banks to reposition their business models toward the real sector, which means banking for retail, SMEs, manufacturing, and so on. Building on CBN reforms under past governors, there were four components of the CBN banking sector reform since 2009, and each of those components has been making very significant progress. The first component of the reform was to enhance the quality of banks. That was to ensure that the corporate governance of banks is sound, the risk management by banks is sound, and the asset quality is sound. The second leg was to establish financial stability, which was severely threatened by a combination of the global financial crisis and some corporate governance and risk management failures in the banking system. We had to restore financial stability and we did that in a number of ways, especially with the establishment of the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) to buy non-performing loans (NPLs) from the banks and give them a clean balance sheet to get them lending again. The average NPL ratio at that time was about 35%, and we brought it down to under 5%. The third leg of the banking reform was to facilitate the evolution of a healthy financial system, and that is something that we did in two ways. First was to create a new banking model in which the CBN restructured the banking system to have three broad types of banks: commercial banks, merchant or investment banks, and specialized banks, such as those that cater more to SMEs, mortgage banking, and so on. Before the reforms, we had universal banking and one bank could be a conglomerate of financial services. When you have this type of structure, you have a bank that owns all the subsidiaries and the CBN regulates the bank, but not the insurance or pension funds, for example. That led to gaps in terms of the movement of funds between the subsidiaries, and regulatory arbitrage. We stopped this with the new model and separated core banking from other financial activities. The fourth leg of the reforms was to ensure that banks lend to the real economy, and that is very important for the long term. These are the four main pillars of the reforms, and I think in each one of these pillars the CBN has achieved very significant success. A reform is not a destination; it is a process, so we cannot say we have arrived, but the banking system is very markedly different from what it was in 2009.</p><h4>What was the net impact of AMCON, and will it continue to operate now that NPLs are at an acceptable level?</h4><p>The purchase of NPLs by AMCON sent the NPL ratio crashing down. AMCON has been very successful in terms of completing its objectives. AMCON is no longer buying new loans and it is no longer capitalizing the banks, but it has done that. Immediately after the establishment of AMCON, there was a merger and acquisition process of various weak banks. They were opened up to new investment so some were merged, and some took over others. AMCON helped these  processes. For the three out of the eight that we were not able to recapitalize by the deadline, AMCON took them over and recapitalized them; now they are in the process of being sold by mid-2015. The Nigerian banking system intervention to restore financial stability has taken place without any depositor losing a single cent. Nigeria is perhaps the only country in the world in the wake of the financial crisis where you can say this. It is also the only country where you can say the Treasury was not directly involved in the bailout of the banks, in the sense of providing direct funding for bailouts. The way we were able to do this is because AMCON issued bonds. Those bonds are guaranteed by the federal government and we have set in place a mechanism to ensure that that contingent liability of the federal government is not called upon, ever. We have done this in two ways that were unique. Nigeria became the only country in the world in which the banks themselves were able to contribute to the banking crisis resolution. The banks contribute 0.05% of their total assets every year to a sinking fund to pay off AMCON's funds. That is one. The CBN also contributes to that sinking fund, paying NGN50 billion a year. Between these contributions to the sink-in fund, AMCON's recovery to the debts it holds, we expect that the sums will balance themselves out. Thus, financial stability has largely been achieved because of this. We now have banks being encouraged to lend.</p><div class="quote">“Financial inclusion is a very important part of our strategy."</div><h4>How is the CBN contributing to the national goal of increasing financial inclusion?</h4><p>Financial inclusion is a very important part of our strategy. It is important for creating financial stability because the more people you have, the more diversified your deposit base, and the stronger the system is. It is also the key channel of economic development because it allows entrepreneurs to access financial services. So yes, we have taken financial inclusion very seriously and we have a strategy that we can share. We are hoping to bring down financial exclusion by 50% by the year 2020. We belong to the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, a global alliance of central banks and financial regulators that seeks to create ways to bring the excluded into the financial system. We are going about financial inclusion in a number of ways. First is enhancing financial literacy, which is the most important aspect for financial inclusion. People need to be educated about the benefits of going into banking services, micro insurance, and micro savings. It is not just banking but insurance, pensions, and other aspects of the financial system. We are rolling out the financial education program at this time, covering the whole country and offering programs to educate Nigerians on where they should put their money in the financial system. Another barrier to inclusion is trust. We tackle this problem in two ways, first through the educational process and second by talking to the banks about a reduction in what they call commission on turnover (COT). We negotiated with the banks to reduce their fees on this COT by 2015. This is a huge confidence boost for the financial system. If Nigerians see themselves putting money into the bank and then being charged hidden fees, why would they put money in the bank? We have also removed obstacles for opening an account for those at the bottom end of the pyramid. We reduced the requirements for the lowest levels of customers to open bank accounts. We have moderated some of the requirements, but staggered those requirements based on the level of customers so that banks manage their risk at the same time.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of Pinturas AYA and what kind of services do you offer in Panama?</h4><p>We have been in Panama since 1995; however, we only receive products from our main factory in Venezuela. We opened our first factory in Panama in 2007 and our second in 2012. We have two manufacturing plants here, but the main one still remains in Venezuela and we will soon be opening one in Houston in the US.</p><h4>What has been your growth strategy in Panama?</h4><p>Around 70% of the market for the paint industry goes to construction, and the other 30% goes to industry, subspace, and marine coating, which is the area of the market where we work. In the beginning, we shipped products from South America to Central America; however, when our market grew enough we established a manufacturing facility. We assumed manufacturing in four different segments. The first area is heavy industry and marine coating, which is for the petroleum industry. The second area is high-performance and construction coating, which is dedicated to protecting steel located in different areas. The third one is for car finishes and aerospace. The sector for high-performance paints is better in Central America than South America as more things are made from steel, which is our fourth segment. Finally, there is a small market in Central America for wood coatings.</p><h4>Which is the product that you provide the most?</h4><p>The product we provide the most is heavy industrial and marine paint. We also have equipment for the Panama Canal. The Canal needs to be maintained regularly, and we had a corporate agreement with the Panama Canal Authority since 2010 to provide all the paint it needs to protect and maintain its facilities. We are the sole provider for the Canal and all the paint it uses comes from our factory, which is one of the main reasons we have the facility here. We have an agreement also with the Universidad de Panama in order to source human talent. We use the graduates to teach our employees, because this company is made up of at least 90% Panamanians.</p><div class="quote">“The Canal needs to be maintained regularly, and we had a corporate agreement with the Panama Canal Authority since 2010."</div><h4>How important is innovation for this company?</h4><p>It means everything for us. We have research labs. Technology changes, and there are different environmental regulations that we need stay ahead of. People don't want to waste energy or time on cleaning a surface; therefore, we need to offer easy and efficient solutions for our clients. We have built a solid relationship with local manufacturers in order to open a new branch and develop products. They help us in our labs to create new products.</p><h4>Which country represents the biggest income for the company?</h4><p>The biggest revenue sources for us in Latin America are Brazil, Argentina, and then a tie between Venezuela and Colombia. For us, our main market is Venezuela. Many companies have been leaving the country; hence, there are fewer suppliers and a lot of market to cover. Regarding Panama, it has been steadily growing and is a very globalized country. Different countries have an impact on it, and you can take raw materials from anywhere easily. Panama is a country in which you can trust. Panama will grow very much over the medium term.</p><h4>What are your expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We expanded in 2012 with a new manufacturing facility in Panama. So, we need to wait for at least five years, which is the time it takes to train our people. We are an ISO 9002 certified company, and we also have SSBC certification. People need to be involved with the company and that takes time. After five years, we hope to go into Bolivia and Ecuador because of the petroleum industry. Brazil has a very closed border and there are heavy duties on imports. You need to invest in Brazil, otherwise you can't get in, meaning it is not worth it at the moment for us to work there. Argentina is very unstable, and its situation changes every five years. Chile is a very long country, meaning you need to open four different offices in order to serve the market.</p><h4>What will be the impact of the expansion of the Panama Canal for Pinturas AYA?</h4><p>It is very important. The Panama Canal mainly serves the transportation of the US from East to West. The largest ship that comes through is the size of the Titanic. At the time the Canal was built that was the largest size of ship around. The problem now is that the largest ships are not able to pass. The expansion will mean that newer ships will be able to pass through the Panama Canal now, and those ships will stop in Panama to receive supplies. The seaports in New Orleans and San Diego have been increasing their capacity, and so has Panama and Manzanillo. A new port is being also built in El Diablo. Significant shipping volumes will pass through Panama, and that means that it is good for the local economy and therefore good for us. Ships mean paint for us. The actual expansion of the Canal is not that important for our business, instead it is what passes through it.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You started MaCeen Capital in 2010. What market conditions made it possible?</h4><p>The market conditions in Saudi Arabia can be briefly described as having strong financial and banking sectors, as well as a mature commercial banking sector. Locally, we required a higher number of investments because we direct our investments toward international markets by hiring fund managers. Until 2010, Saudi Arabia did not witness any real activity in the investment banking industry. The market faced a significant crash in 2006, and later the international crisis, in 2008, affected the entire region, especially Dubai. In 2010, we realized that there was a gap between investors and investment opportunities; they were not connected, especially after the formal establishment of the Capital Market Authority (CMA) in 2003, through which new rules and regulations were issued to control and organize the investment process. We saw that there was a real opportunity to tap into the financial services sector in Saudi Arabia, especially as there wasn't any financial firm that offered the value-added needed into the Saudi Arabian market, which recorded excellent growth rates and presented a significant expansion in commercial activities and government support, especially to very large lines of multi-production. We also saw that there was a gap between investors, opportunities, and regulations that needed to be filled. Therefore, we seized this opportunity to establish Maceen Capital, an investment company that provides a sophisticated and disciplined methodology that helps those in charge of businesses to improve their company performance by providing them with optimal investment solutions that suit their needs and continuous requirements. In 2010, we started investing in real estate and we have been doing a great job ever since, as we have managed SAR3 billion of assets under management (AUM) in a short period of time, which indicates the high demand in the market. We also realized that our target audience is not only looking to invest in the real estate sector, and that is why we allowed the market to lead us. This is the strategic approach adopted by MaCeen since the start, which positioned it as an unconventional and dynamic investment group that provides its services in real estate investment, capital markets investment, private equity, and alternative investments.</p><h4>When you started in 2010, was part of your strategy to capitalize on the difficult time many markets were having?</h4><p>External conditions were not the only reason we started so steadily and kept growing. On the other hand, the Saudi market since the founding of MaCeen Capital was in steady growth and continuous expansion, which was of great benefit and had a positive influence on our business and services. The conditions of the global crisis were nothing but an opportunity for the international markets to improve performance and avoid past mistakes, and we at MaCeen Capital take into account the needs of the market and its requirements in the long run. Our competitive advantage was, and still is, our knowledge of the Saudi market; knowing that, we were able to seize opportunities as they arose, whether from real estate, debt capital markets, or private equity. We at Maceen have invested in all of these sectors, but our major investment was in the real estate sector as we developed 14 real estate funds.</p><h4>How do you anticipate the effects of foreign investment regulations on the market?</h4><p>Knowing that foreign investment has its merits and disadvantages on any given economy, the relevant authorities must take into account the methodologies of the local market, which does not accept changes easily and, at the same time, must take into account the value-added of foreign investment in the market. From our experience, foreign investors fail to compete with local market players because legislation does not take into consideration the conditions and investment environment for each party. Therefore, I think it will be a major task for the parties in the relevant legislation, regulation, and justice systems to ensure the highest standards of business ethics in global business.</p><div class="quote">“I believe that the Saudi market is a promising market for all sectors and industries."</div><h4>How are labor reforms affecting infrastructure projects, construction firms, and even real estate developments?</h4><p>There are certainly some delays in the completion of projects that are under process, but there are no doubts that they will be finished. We are facing some issues related to land development due to governmental rules and restrictions since it might take up to a year and a half to receive permission to develop land. If we can diminish this period, it will definitely have a positive effect on the residential and housing industry compared to other industries and parties. I think that the new legislation with regard to the labor laws in Saudi Arabia is positive, leading the market to improve the working environment to attract more of the most efficient and serious workforce. In normal conditions authorities face resistance to changes in legislation, but as we have witnessed so far the business community quickly accepted it and returned to work with full force.</p><h4>Which sectors and investments appear the most promising over the coming two to five years?</h4><p>I believe that the Saudi market is a promising market for all sectors and industries, because it is in fact an emerging market and we at MaCeen will be focusing on private equity, as this is a large and untapped opportunity. Private equity is a major driver in the growth of the economy, and will even affect the capital markets in Saudi Arabia. Some of the most successful stories originate from a venture capitalist investing in private equity and entering the capital markets. There are a number of institutions today, such as King Saud University and Silicon Valley in Riyadh, which incubate these entrepreneurs. The cement sector is also very promising. A royal decree has approved the participation of the cement sector in the capital markets in Saudi Arabia, and this process has to follow a methodology that requires them to be established as venture capital and then gradually enter the capital markets, and that transition should take place through investment banks or companies specialized in fund management. The Saudi market is a promising market for all sectors and industries. However, I think the most influential industries are petrochemicals, cement, imports, construction and real estate development, administrative advisory services, tourism and hospitality, telecommunications, financial services, and investment banking. We at Maceen are definitely working on becoming pioneers in the private equity and alternative investments sectors.</p><h4>Are you planning to capitalize on your AUM within the coming five years?</h4><p>MaCeen has all the major components that contribute to its success and development, including a professional executive team, a well-structured entity, a total of SAR3 billion in AUM, and, above all, decentralized decision making, since MaCeen is owned by individual investors and doesn't belong to a bank, which facilitates and speeds up the investment process. Having said all this, we expect to be one of the leading investment companies in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize the role of Banco Comercial e de Investimentos (BCI)?</h4><p>BCI is one of the leading banks in Mozambique, and of particular importance for SMEs. We are squarely focused on the economic and social development of the country, having become one of the most preferred banks among Mozambicans, and are held in high regard. We have also registered growth over the past few years. BCI is known for taking a novel approach to individual business segments. For example, we were the first to launch integrated business centers, which are unique venues where we serve diverse clients with corporate, exclusive, and retail areas, under one roof. We have also been active market leaders in electronic channels, as well as the biggest card issuer with the most point of sales. We have also registered considerable success in non-traditional channels, such as online banking, where we continue to grow. We have paid significant attention to human resources, having trained and fully prepared our people to be able to provide superlative service quality. In fact, we have won a number of awards, and have recently been named best commercial bank.</p><h4>What innovative solutions have you tailored to the Mozambican market?</h4><p>In October 2013, we launched a credit line for Mozambican SMEs. This was the first time that a bank had allowed a 0% spread over the prime rate to SMEs. We understood that pricing was the question, and that there was a barrier to be broken in order to bring the small companies to the market. There was also a need to communicate with the market regarding our new corporate status. Today, we are considering a second line, as the first will shortly reach capacity. This would give us a better picture of the true nature of the market.</p><div class="quote">“I think momentum comes from both formerly unbanked clients and those switching banks."</div><h4>In terms of the SME segment, what is the advantage of working with BCI rather than a bank that focuses solely on SMEs?</h4><p>We have a wider offer; our specific service model allocates managers specifically to SMEs. We have exclusive conditions in terms of credit lines and not only consider credit needs, but also the day-to-day needs of SMEs. We also look at liquidity management and payment solutions. We provide export and import solutions in order to make a complete offer that matches the needs of such companies. We have also supported many of the activities of the Institute for the Promotion of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (IPEME) to foster the development of entrepreneurs nationwide. We have been working very closely with the government in support of a wide range of new SMEs. We strongly believe that SMEs will be crucial for Mozambique in terms of generating equity. This will indirectly assist larger companies engaged in new projects, and those undertaking new operations, as SMEs are a key link in the value chain in Mozambique.</p><h4>What is the driver of growth in the retail segment?</h4><p>I think momentum comes from both formerly unbanked clients and those switching banks. We have notably grown in terms of client numbers, including those for whom we were their first bank. Other clients have switched banks to us, either during a campaign or upon word of mouth recommendation. Today, we are focused on enlarging our client number by catering to unbanked Mozambicans, and this activity is part of the government's target of enlarging banking coverage nationwide. It also explains why we have opened many branches in uncovered districts of the country. We opened six new branches in 2013, and plan for 12 more in 2014.</p><h4>Does technology play a big part in reaching rural communities?</h4><p>Yes, we rely on it heavily to deliver our services. We are even planning an important experiment whereby we will be the first to launch a mobile bank, which will effectively be a travelling branch, the staff of which will enable people to open an account, make deposits and withdrawals, and use ATMs.</p><h4>What is the advantage of working with BCI for international corporates coming into Mozambique?</h4><p>BCI is a strong, sustainable, profitable, and liquid bank. We have launched a corporate direct channel with a corporate department that deals with large companies that are settled or want to settle their operations in Mozambique. This is one of the core areas of our structure. We have created specific client managers for these clients, and are banking all of the major companies present in Mozambique. The dedicated desks established to address the needs of specific segments within the economy mean that we have, say, energy, infrastructure, and agriculture-related know-how that allows us to better help with specific projects that require specialized knowledge. Regarding the capability of our own funds and the volume of credit lines, we can handle what we have put in place and the investment banking operation that is able to support large-scale projects, such as project finance, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and corporate banking, and so forth. Once a project's requirement outgrows our local capacities, we call on the support of our colleagues in Portugal. The international platform of financial groups to which we belong is wide and supports Mozambique's principle commercial and investment relations. We have a platform in South Africa, and others in Brazil, China, and the US, enabling us to confidently support the movement of capital and goods worldwide. This is a comparative advantage that we have when targeting those clients.</p><h4>Is increased competition a positive force in the market?</h4><p>The market is essentially controlled by two banks of significant market share, namely Millenium bim and BCI. Often, what you observe in the banking sector is a leader and group of banks that are chipping away at it; however, in Mozambique you basically only have BCI. There should be a larger number of players here to foster a more balanced market. There is a third level of banks that are facing more serious competition as they are small and cannot adequately compete. Each bank is positioning itself with a general approach, so there is room in the local banking universe for niche services.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Global Bank was founded in 1994 and today, 20 years later, it is the second largest private bank in Panama by assets. Could you walk us through the history of your success?</h4><p>We began with mostly corporate business, which remained our core activity for the first five years of operations. Following an acquisition, we expanded more into personal and retail banking. Since then, we have basically implemented what we call a universal banking strategy. In other words, we participate in many different markets in Panama, as long as they are viable in terms of a risk/return profile. The reason we have grown is because we started with a clear strategy in a growing economy; that and the fact that we have maintained a high level of service and are able to respond to our clients' needs efficiently compared to other local and foreign banks that operate in Panama. Also, there has been a process of consolidation in the industry, and all of these factors together explain our growth over the past 20 years.</p><h4>What were the main benefits and synergies gained from the acquisition of another bank in 1999?</h4><p>The main benefit was the broadening of the range of services, products, and markets that we cater to in Panama. It also increased our branch network, the number of geographic areas in which we operate, and added not only size, but also a new perspective of the markets that we could serve. In our global portfolio, we are split into two-thirds corporate and one-third personal banking, but the intention of the bank is to serve all areas of banking, not only personal banking, but also corporate banking, corporate finance, insurance, and private banking. We also have an area that deals with international banking from Panama, and we lend in Costa Rica and the rest of Central America. This has become a growing area for the bank. In addition, we have a captive insurance company, a trust company, and have a seat on the local exchange. In other words, we have formed a conglomerate of financial companies and financial entities that have all evolved around the bank, with each serving different purposes.</p><h4>How are you growing subsidiaries like Global Valores, Aseguradora Global, and Global Financial Funds, and what differentiates them from other investments?</h4><p>Those and the factoring company have to provide the services and the quality of services that the market requires, as stand alone entities. But on the other hand, they all benefit mutually from having a one-stop arrangement where clients can do most, if not all of the financial transactions they need with the synergies that can bring.</p><div class="quote">“Bancarization has grown in Panama, and is at a high level compared with the rest of Latin America."</div><h4>What has been the trend in bancarization over the past five years, and what is the advantage of electronic banking?</h4><p>Bancarization has grown in Panama, and is at a high level compared with the rest of Latin America. Participation in electronic banking and internet banking has increased. People have many other means available to them today to deal with the bank, including the internet, ATMs, call centers, and telephone banking.</p><h4>A key trend in commercial banking is the advance to a more human-focused model. What is your commitment to this concept and how important is it for the banking sector?</h4><p>It is important because we always pride ourselves on dealing with our clients on a personal basis and strive to serve their financial needs in the best way. In other words, we try to adapt our systems, policies, and products to meet the specific needs of the client.</p><h4>What is your view of corporate social responsibility?</h4><p>We are active in social responsibility programs through our involvement with several major NGOs. In particular, we developed a financial education program that we have run for a number of years, whereby we approached senior students in public high schools and developed workshops to explain the workings of the financial system and how they could work in it. We are aware that many people lack the knowledge and lose opportunities and time figuring out how to deal with their personal finances. It is a good idea to start with young people who are still in high school.</p><h4>What are your financial expectations for this year?</h4><p>We foresee slower growth than in 2013. The economy is growing rapidly, but not at the same high rate as previously, and we have followed that trend.</p><h4>Could you comment on the state of the Panamanian investment banking industry?</h4><p>The investment banking industry in Panama has progressed significantly, and it is now a fundamental part or Panama's financial landscape. The increase in the size of transactions and deals partially explains this trend. In the past, these transactions were not sufficiently large enough to demand the participation of an investment banking team, as they do now. Today we have much larger transactions that need to be structured specifically to meet the demands of the issuers and the potential clients or investors. Investment banking has grown much faster over the past three or four years, and expectations are that it will continue to grow.</p><h4>What do you see as the key challenges that the banking sector faces?</h4><p>Critical challenges are related to the future of interest rates, as I believe that we will face higher rates going forward. We will need to adapt to a country that has grown rapidly, yet one that will continue to grow at a lower rate. We need to find new sources of funding for this growth, which could come from non-traditional local investors or from international players. Forecasts for economic growth are at around 6% to 7% for 2014, which would be robust, though not as good as the 8% to 10% of previous years.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you outline the strategy that AFIDRO has implemented to promote quality and innovation within the industry?</h4><p>Colombia's regulatory framework is highly favorable for multinational pharmaceutical companies. It is in fact rather economical to develop R&amp;D activities. The environment has led to many of these large companies developing some of their primary multinational clinical research in our country; the research for new medication has positively contributed to the development of the industry, particularly in its research and innovation segments. We promote the arrival of investment from foreign pharmaceutical companies within the research segment, or alternatively they support research activity in Colombia through sponsorship, subsidies, or donations. For example, there is a large European company in charge, as a sponsor, of the most important research on Dengue fever in the world, which is taking place here. Our strategy focuses on making sure that companies are actively involved in developing research activity in Colombia.</p><h4>Could you tell us more about Colombia's current regulatory framework for clinical research?</h4><p>Current regulation regarding clinical research was first adopted some four years ago, and has become stricter over this time. Basically, the current regulatory framework perfectly defines conditions for each of the clinical research steps, from establishing research centers to research methodology, as well as the ethical issues surrounding clinical research. Overall, I would define it as a highly sophisticated framework supported by research and health institutions like our own that have become leaders in the pharmaceutical field at a regional level.</p><div class="quote">“I think it is important to provide objective and reasonable arguments to the current debate in the health sector."</div><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the pharmaceutical research sector in Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia is at a crossroads: it has to decide in which direction the country wants to develop its pharmaceutical sector. The sector is globally strategic and I think our country needs to actually understand that. Our economy was based primarily on commodities, and thanks to recent economic developments the country has come to learn that services and innovation will continue to play an important role in the growth of the national economy. In this perspective, the country should increase its efforts to strengthen pharmaceutical research, encouraging both local and foreign companies to develop, produce, and promote innovation in Colombia. It's a challenging moment for the industry and the country. For example, Brazil, India, and Israel, some 20 years ago, decided to strengthen the production of generic drugs, each developing very strong industries. Only now do these countries seem to have turned to research and innovation within the industry to have taken a step forward. Colombia has a rather strong generic drug industry at a regional level. However, we lack innovation and the country's industry is currently undergoing a transitional period in which an important decision must be taken regarding this.</p><h4>What is the impact of the pharmaceutical industry on the Colombian health sector?</h4><p>The pharmaceutical market represents around 17% of the health industry in Colombia in terms of spending, according to figures released by the country's Ministry of Health. I think these figures also show rather low spending in medication; for example, the yearly per capita health expenditure in Spain is $2,400, and $4,000 in Italy. The figure in Colombia currently stands at $500, meaning that we have solid growth potential for the next few years. In this context, Colombia is viewed as an expensive market in Latin America for medication, as the healthcare structure in our country suffered from several problems that made the distribution chain more complex and expensive than other regional markets, consequently making the products themselves more expensive. However, there are particular products that are still cheaper in Colombia than in other countries; hormones, beauty products, and women's health treatments are among these. At the same time, the government of Colombia has taken active steps to regulate the market price in the country, which positively contributes to progressively reducing prices.</p><h4>What is your opinion about the Compulsory Health Plan?</h4><p>This plan was neither updated nor modified for many years. Only two years ago, the government took the lead to update it; however, I think it already requires a new modification, because of the current technology needs regarding medical treatments. If such modifications do not take place as soon as possible, I believe the health system and this plan in particular will suffer from long-standing problems. We should keep in mind that Colombia enjoys a universal health system, which is not something of which every country can boast. However, public opinion toward the health system tends to be negative due to its inherent problems. That said, I think Colombia's healthcare system positively compares to those of other countries worldwide.</p><h4>You have stated AFIDRO's aim of putting the patient at the center of clinical research. How do you plan to do that?</h4><p>Colombia has long been working on the financial sustainability of the healthcare system, consequently forgetting the centrality of the patient. Financial sustainability has monopolized the health debate in the country for many years, and I believe we should try to make sure we prioritize health indicators among the Colombian population.</p><h4>What role can AFIDRO play in achieving such goals?</h4><p>I think it is important to provide objective and reasonable arguments to the current debate in the health sector. As part of the pharmaceutical industry, we are a very important player in the health system and our opinion is always well analyzed. We think we can play a more active role in the debate and the further development of the health system in Colombia. In my particular case, I have been professionally engaged in all fields of the health system, including the government. Our industry is committed to complying with all the necessary regulations to help institutionalize the system and show the country that rules can be respected. At the same time, we have interim ethical codes and auto regulatory policies for the pharmaceutical companies in terms of product commercialization, and consumer rights. If found to not be in compliance with them, companies could face severe fines from within the association.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Siemens contributed to economic development in Ecuador over the past four decades?</h4><p>During that period, Siemens had pursued the fundamental goal of contributing to the development of Ecuador's telecommunications sector. Indeed, up until 2007, we had squarely focused our business activity on that particular industry. Since that year however, we have restructured our portfolio into the four main components of energy, industry, healthcare, and infrastructure and cities. We pride ourselves on our dynamism and flexibility in adapting to changing markets, which is what we have long done in Ecuador. In the energy sector, products and services offered by Siemens focus on the generation of both renewable and non-renewable energy. For example, we are a leading global company in terms of onshore wind farms, and among the largest in terms of offshore wind parks. We are also a leading producer of steam turbines, as well as diesel and gas variants. In terms of our activity in the industrial sector, we focus on providing solutions for our clients' industrial processes, especially in terms of their automation. In the healthcare segment, we specialize in the manufacturing of high-tech medical equipment for the detection and treatment of illnesses and diseases. Additionally, we recently expanded our activity in healthcare within the sphere of diagnostics, including the manufacture and commercialization of equipment and chemical products for blood test analyses. Finally, the infrastructure and cities sector is rather new, having been established some two years ago upon the restructuring of certain parts of the energy and industry segments. We have also factored transport into this area, as we are a global leader in electric transport technology. Siemens' pedigree in Ecuador in these four areas means that we are in a position to tackle projects anywhere in the country. For example, the Quito Underground project is of particular interest to us, and we consider it a high priority. Additionally, we have already taken part in various projects to build hydroelectric plants in Ecuador, and are keen to expand our activity in this particular segment by leveraging our extensive know-how to the benefit of the country. Large-scale wind parks are also some of the targeted projects for Siemens in Ecuador. These are just selected examples, and I could also mention the Pacific Refinery, a very important project for Ecuador, and potentially for Siemens, too. In the health industry, Siemens has already sold a significant amount of high-tech equipment to Ecuadorean hospitals, and due to the government's significant investment in this sector, I am sure we can only increase our activity in it. One of Siemens' main competitive advantages is its high-quality technology, which is recognized worldwide. Furthermore, we are known as a reliable partner that ensures security and reliability in terms of products and services, and that has knowledge of both domestic and foreign markets. We have been in Ecuador during the good years and the bad, and our position has evolved over time. However, we have always been a leading company and a synonym for quality, trust, experience, and transparency.</p><h4>What is the significance of Ecuador for Siemens globally?</h4><p>For Siemens, it is vital to take part in Ecuador's largest infrastructure projects, especially those related to the government's plans to shake up the national energy and electricity matrix. I believe that Siemens can play a leading role in this process, saving the country significant expense over the long term. The Pacific Refinery is another top priority for Siemens, because in the future it is set to become a key element in the broader economic development of the country. Overall, Siemens is eager to participate in Ecuador's high-tech projects of social and economic merit. Finally, the high levels of investment in education and public health committed to by the incumbent government also interest Siemens as a leading manufacturer of medical equipment and technology. Siemens is well equipped to leave its social footprint on Ecuadorean society through the strength of its leading-edge technological offering.</p><div class="quote">“For Siemens, it is vital to take part in Ecuador's largest infrastructure projects."</div><h4>What challenges does Ecuador present as a place to do business, and how has Siemens adapted to them?</h4><p>I would wish to establish a manufacturing plant in Ecuador, yet the country has to take certain steps toward easing the entry of foreign investment in the production arena, being a rather high-cost country when compared to other regional destinations. I mainly refer to customs benefits, workforce, taxes, legal security, and so on. For example, 85% of the investment in Ecuador comes from public sources, meaning that the major investor in the country is the government itself. The government would be well advised to reconsider the general conditions required to attract a greater volume of foreign investment. The current level of public investment has been possible thanks to the efforts by the central government to recover strategic resources in the national interest, which in some cases had previously been mismanaged by private companies. I believe that Ecuador's large infrastructure projects that Siemens is interested in could potentially bring about a turning point regarding the business environment for foreign companies, as the government is set to allow foreign players to play a very active role. I personally believe that Ecuador has achieved greater development over the past 10 years than it had managed to do in the previous 50. However, it still needs to take another step forward in certain areas such as attaching greater value to technology and quality than to money when it comes to tendering large infrastructure projects; as such projects form the bedrock of broader national development. In this context, the government has already taken key steps to leverage the quality of imported products by introducing a host of regulatory measures and requirements to be met by foreign products, reducing the overall number of imports and favoring quality.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Ecuador as a commercial address?</h4><p>Ecuador is a highly attractive country for doing business; the government is willing to open the doors to foreign investors, and we are also talking about a country that needs infrastructure for its development. In this context, foreign investors require the flexibility to adapt to any type of condition they may encounter, which Siemens clearly possesses. As CEO of Siemens and an Ecuadorean myself, I only hope that we continue on this path in the future for the benefit of the private sector, as well as of the country and its people, because we still have a tangible need for infrastructure. However, and as I have said, we require higher levels of foreign investment in Ecuador to boost overall development. The government is taking the right steps in this direction, but foreign investors still need to see a more appealing environment.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Julius Berger arrived in Nigeria about 50 years ago. What is left of your German heritage and how localized is the company now?</h4><p>Today Julius Berger is an indigenous Nigerian company. We are headquartered in Abuja with additional permanent locations in Lagos and Uyo, and we are listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Over 96% of our workforce is Nigerian, and we are dedicated to our investments in Nigerian content. Throughout our 50 years of operating in Nigeria, we have played an important role in the country's development, starting with our first construction project in the country, which was the Eko Bridge in 1965. Julius Berger was founded in Germany more than 100 years ago, and the Eko Bridge was a gift from the German government to Nigeria to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the country's independence. The project managers saw considerable potential in Nigeria, as a result of which the company Julius Berger Nigeria Limited was registered in 1970. Over the years, there was a gradual process in the 1970s and 1980s of increasing Nigerian participation in the ownership structure and shareholding. At the end of the 1980s, the company went public and was listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Currently, Bilfinger Berger, a German construction company, owns approximately one-third of the shares; the other two-thirds are under Nigerian ownership, including individuals, pension funds, states, and large and small investors. We retain our German roots, but the bulk of the company is Nigerian owned. We think it is a very good thing because the current legislation process and agenda of the government is increasingly in support of indigenous companies. We aim for a symbiosis of both strengths, the first being our status as a non-traditional indigenous entity, and secondly by innovatively leveraging the German attributes of reliability and efficiency. We employ this formula here to demonstrate that it is possible to achieve much in Nigeria. I think that a company like ours can act as a practical showcase, or as a case study of Nigeria registering progress in capacity building.</p><h4>What are some of the company's main strengths that it seeks to leverage?</h4><p>Julius Berger's commitment to Nigeria is one of the greatest strengths. We have huge investments in this country, not least of which are the roughly 20,000 people on our payroll. These investments are not solely monetary, but in facilities we need to run our business. Nigeria is headed in the right direction, even if not the most stable country in the world. Businesses here require a plan for the worst-case scenario, and the potential return on investments must clearly be weighed up against the risks. Operating exclusively in Nigeria, we do not have the opportunity of packing up our operations and returning to a home country if the worst occurs. Yet this reality only further confirms our commitment, as this will remain our country come what may. These are our biggest strengths and also relate to our interaction with Nigerian society, corporate responsibility, and trying to understand the needs of our country apart from our core business. Through Bilfinger Berger we have a pipeline to the Western world. This gives us access to cutting-edge technology and the international market in terms of procurement and recruitment. We would not be able to ensure quality and reliability with Nigerian resources alone. That said, while our business dealings and the projects we deliver are part of a global issue, the company's decisions are made locally. We are not remote-controlled from abroad, which we view as a major success.</p><h4>How do you make sure that the best practices are applied when it comes to corporate governance and social responsibility?</h4><p>For close to 25 years, we have been a publicly listed company. We are working in-line with the regulations of the Nigerian Stock Exchange and Security Exchange Commission. Global legislation has changed over the past 10 years. However, although legislation may have changed, society has not, and there are “gaps" of disconnection. Since 2007, we have implemented a quite rigid compliance system that is also transparent. We apply this system throughout our organization to protect people as well as our staff, management, and society as a whole. This is not an easy task, but there is no compromise for us. We have a strong conviction that there cannot be a difference between Nigeria and other parts of the world. Also, in the last couple of years, the Security and Exchange Commission in Nigeria has done a very good job of closing loopholes and keeping the private sector in check. We, as a leading contractor in the construction industry, are always the main target. We are proud to be the most exposed company and work very closely with the regulatory agencies. Our hope is that this also pressures other companies in the sector, in terms of good governance. Over the past couple of years we have established transparent policies that are constantly reviewed. Four areas of focus support our corporate responsibility effort. The first focus is health. We are closely involved with local clinics, particularly in the areas where we work. Our second is education, where we support schools and many other aspects of education in the nation. And the third focus is sports, where 20 years ago we sponsored a highly successful football team. We no longer support professional sports, having shifted our efforts to vital areas, particularly for the youth. Our fourth and final focus, which we have been involved in since the company's inception, is support for national emergency management. This includes assistance in the event of natural disasters such as floods and fires, as well as unforeseen accidents like air crashes.</p><div class="quote">“Julius Berger's commitment to Nigeria is one of the greatest strengths."</div><h4>You have taken on the challenge of constructing the new Second Niger Bridge. Could you elaborate on this project?</h4><p>If you look at the Nigerian economy and lack of infrastructure, the construction of the Second Niger Bridge is key—economically, politically, and socially. We have been following the developments surrounding this bridge for a while now. Around 10 or 15 years ago there were many developments surrounding the project, although nothing came to fruition. Just under two years ago, we became convinced that on this occasion the government was serious, and we actively started to participate. There are challenges, but we are confident of being able to overcome them. The primary challenge, I believe, lies in the fact that the bridge is to be built under the public-private partnership (PPP) model. If you look at the legal environment and the policy landscape, PPP is a quite new formula that we have never dealt with. Due to the nature of this project, we have aggressively looked at the possibilities of and partners for this undertaking. We were very proud that our consortium was declared the preferred bidder. If a non-indigenous company, for example, from India or China, had emerged as the preferred bidder, it would have been bitterly disappointing.</p><h4>That gives an indication as to your commitment to the country if you approach it on a personal level.</h4><p>That's absolutely correct, and we are in the process of closing on the financial aspects of the contract, having started some preliminary works, such as soil tests.</p><h4>From a regulatory standpoint, how should the government change its policy framework to support the private sector and the creation of further PPPs?</h4><p>The most important consideration is for the country to ensure consistency. It is sometimes difficult to understand, plan, and predict what the government's policy will be two years down the road. Many changes have the potential to negatively impact private business, which only have a certain margin for flexibility. In Nigeria, a business plan requires huge flexibility. Beyond consistency, we need transparency; the rule of law, so crucial for the private sector in terms of orientation; and the protection of investments. There is still a lot to do toward achieving this.</p><h4>Do you see the 2015 presidential elections as a challenge or an opportunity for the next administration?</h4><p>I perceive it as a particularly good opportunity. Of course, like in any election, there will be challenges. Since the advent of democracy in 1999, each election has become more transparent, free, and fair. I am convinced this election will be a further improvement on previous ones. This will be another opportunity for Nigeria to show the world it is on a solid path.</p><h4>How is your company contributing to the realization of Nigeria's goals for Vision 2020?</h4><p>Our core business is civil construction, that is, the spectrum of buildings, infrastructure, and civil works for industrial plants. When we are awarded a contract, we guarantee the quality of work and value for money. We deliver sustainable solutions that will meet the challenges of a growing nation 2020 and beyond. The major area to be developed in achieving the goals of Vision 2020 is the downstream and manufacturing sectors. Vision 2020 will be very difficult to achieve if the focus lies exclusively on oil-producing plants and roads. Employment in manufacturing plants is necessary. These factories will generate revenue and add weight to national GDP. Nigeria, I believe, is more of a trading society. This is good to a certain extent, but the real economy is the downstream industry—manufacturing, agriculture, and so forth. We are repositioning our company to be prepared to deliver our services to investors in this industry. In fact, we have already begun to play a role in this, with some evidence of success.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the importance of Turkey to Microsoft?</h4><p>Our growth has double the addressable market in Turkey, which grew at 9% on average. We have grown at about 21% annually on average over recent years. With that, Microsoft Turkey's prominence has increased in the Microsoft network. As a result, Turkey is now categorized in the emerging cluster, which also includes China, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, India, and Mexico. More Microsoft resources have also started coming into the country. Microsoft then started to evaluate different R&amp;D opportunities in Turkey, especially in education arena. We have already invested in Koç University's R&amp;D center, ATOM, and some other university projects. Also, we have an innovation center in our Microsoft Ankara office where we support start-ups with our technologies. We believe that the FATİH project, an initiative to get more technology into public education, also creates R&amp;D opportunities focused on education. With 20 years of experience in Turkey, Microsoft has a strong presence in the country through its partnership network, and currently has around 11,000 technology partners, both small and large. These businesses then utilize our products to reach their potential, improving their sales, cost structure, and infrastructure. In that sense, Microsoft's ecosystem is worth approximately $7 billion, which is quite a large number if you consider that it represents about 55% of the total market. Compared to other technology players in the market, we are significantly larger. Microsoft is viewed as an innovation leader in the market. As part of our investment in Turkey, we launched Turkey's first online and free app development program, called Open Academy, two years ago. Currently, Open Academy has over 130,000 registrants and more than 5,000 graduates who have already published theirs apps in Windows Store.</p><h4>What are the main factors behind this growth in Turkey?</h4><p>There are two main drivers. Number one is that Microsoft Turkey has a very large consultancy business. We employ architects that go to companies and can basically implement the most sophisticated technology initiatives that the companies want to implement. When I first arrived, I saw it as a great asset to be able to go to companies and then move them into much different areas. The architects that we employ are the crí¨me de la crí¨me—top of the market professionals. By doing it that way, we became very mission critical in the companies that we operate. The second driver has come about through our pro-active work. I went to 14 cities in Turkey, and in each of those cities I selected around 50 companies, five sectors, and identified about 700 target companies. Out of those 700 companies, we went to those that have a high turnover and low EBITDA and helped it to increase its bottom line by using technology, which changed the conversation. By adding more value to its products and becoming more competitive, Turkish companies have a much better chance of competing in international markets. That part of our business has been growing 47% every three years, which is a huge number.</p><div class="quote">“Microsoft is viewed as an innovation leader in the market."</div><h4>Microsoft globally invested $3 billion in cloud computing in 2013. Where does Turkey figure into plans to grow the cloud?</h4><p>We see four megatrends in the next 10 years. One is cloud computing, another is mobility, followed by big data, and finally social media. All of our strategies operate around those four megatrends. Cloud computing is at the core of the whole thing because, for mobility to work properly, we need the cloud. We have been adapting the cloud much faster than anybody else has within the sector. The cloud is more accessible because you pay for as much as you use. It gives you the latest, most advanced technology at your fingertips. Therefore, when we go to a company, they can take that technology, plug in to wherever they want to plug it into, and immediately improve processes. Our customers start seeing the return on their investment immediately.</p><h4>What are your plans to expand your mobile division in Turkey?</h4><p>Mobile smartphone penetration in Turkey is a very big strategy for us. Smartphones represent 57% of the total phones sold in Turkey. There is a major migration toward tablets and smartphones. It is a very important strategy for us, both on the commercial and on the consumer side, to get involved in that industry.</p><h4>What are your goals for 2014?</h4><p>We have grown in terms of turnover. In 2014, we are looking to bring more Microsoft assets into Turkey, develop our staff, and give back to society. The Microsoft Turkey Open Academy program will also get bigger. We are working with the Minister of Education to turn it into a curriculum for high schools. On the industry side, the migration of cloud computing us a priority. Companies completely understand the benefits of technology so they can compete better in foreign markets, and that is another major goal for us. The country has very good fundamentals, a young population, and more. Hopefully, we will grow and shape the future of the country with the better usage of technology.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[through-the-keyhole]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which segments have you developed in Dubai since the company's entrance into the market in 2002?</h4><p>Since the company's inception, the main focus has always been luxury real estate development. This was a natural business model for our home market of Dubai, developed largely for affluent customers. Yet our luxury offering doesn't always mean hugely expensive, and DAMAC Properties develops luxury living experiences starting from US$100,000, which will provide a luxurious unit with all the benefits of a luxury address.</p><h4>DAMAC Properties works with different luxury brands in its portfolio. Are you planning to acquire new brands to improve your offering?</h4><p>When you are in the luxury business, there are always a certain number of clients keen on a limited edition. Our collaboration with globally iconic brands is our way of providing a limited series. We have launched the Trump Estates, which are exclusive villas and mansions with the design touches of Ivanka Trump, limited to only 104 units. It's the same with high-rise apartments, such as our iconic towers in Dubai, where we offer a limited number of units on the marina, with interiors by Italian fashion house FENDI. That was our first collaboration with the Louis Vuitton group. We saw that, in real estate, the best way to launch a limited series was to collaborate with an iconic brand.</p><h4>What are your strategies for geographical expansion?</h4><p>We are mainly engaged in the Middle East market. Our hometown and the seat of our business will always be Dubai. We have additional projects in Abu Dhabi, Jeddah, Riyadh, Amman, and Doha, and any expansion in the Middle East will mainly be in those cities. We established a company in 2013 in Baghdad, and are probing the market as we know that it is ultimately destined to be one of the largest real estate markets in the Middle East.</p><div class="quote">“Dubai is one of the best areas for second homes, vacation homes, weekend homes, and recreation homes."</div><h4>DAMAC was planning to call some investors to Dubai from different countries. Why are you interested in doing this?</h4><p>Dubai is one of the best areas for second homes, vacation homes, weekend homes, and recreation homes; places that you visit for business and relaxation. And many people who have set up business here take an apartment or house, because they visit this city four or five times per year. People from Saudi Arabia are often here on vacation for the weekend, as are many people from India. Dubai is an aspirational destination for so many neighboring cities, offering convenience and opulence, but also safety and security in stark contrast to many regional countries. In addition to this, in 2013 Dubai had 10 million tourists, with 69 million transit passengers arriving at the airport. The target is to convert some of the latter travellers into tourist arrivals. There are many conscious steps that the government is taking to make sure that Dubai remains competitive. If you have an apartment here, for instance, but don't frequently use it, you can give it to a hotel company that will rent it for you on an overnight basis as part of its business, which in turn increases the current 80,000 hospitality units in the market. This is why we ventured very heavily into the luxury hotel apartments sector. We now have, in Dubai, over 8,000 hotel apartments under development. And the unique model that we started with hotel apartments is that you buy a hotel apartment from us, and on completion put that unit into the rental pool if you so choose and we will remove all the stress and manage the property on your behalf.</p><h4>How important will the hospitality sector be in your future portfolio?</h4><p>Hotel apartments today constitute approximately one-third of our portfolio. This is how much we believe that packaging hospitality with real estate is valid, especially in a city where tourism and services generate over 50% of national income.</p><h4>Which other segment is DAMAC keen to open in?</h4><p>The DAMAC Properties development portfolio is split into three main areas of luxury living. Firstly is our core business of luxury apartments, in the best locations throughout Dubai and the Middle East. We are also at the forefront of the hospitality boom in the region, with serviced hotel apartments and hotel projects. Finally, we are bringing to the market some of the most desirable villa communities anywhere in the Middle East. In each of these sectors we are working with globally iconic brands to deliver exciting and unique living experiences.</p><h4>AKOYA by DAMAC is one of DAMAC's flagship projects currently. What are your expectations for this specific project?</h4><p>AKOYA by DAMAC is fast becoming one of the most desirable golf course communities anywhere, with a 4.3 million square foot private park, swimming pools, landscaped gardens, and a state-of-the-art gymnasium included in each of the developments. The 42 million square foot master development is just 10 minutes from Sheikh Zayed Road, set around the Trump International Golf Club, Dubai—the first Trump course to be operated and managed by the Trump Organization in the Middle East and Asia. The community was recently named as the “Best International Golf Development" in the world at the International Property Awards.</p><h4>Regarding Expo 2020, DAMAC Properties has launched TENORA and Celestia in Dubai World Central. Can you talk more about your aspirations for these and other projects you plan for Dubai to boost the city for Expo 2020?</h4><p>TENORA will be ready by 2015 and Celestia by 2016. These projects, set close to the Al Maktoum International Airport and the site of the World Expo 2020, will support those working on preparing for the event and for those moving to that end of Dubai in future years. TENORA and Celestia will assist people who want to work in those areas without a long drive, because the closest hotel is either in Jafza or in the Greens community.</p><h4>What further opportunities exist in the area after Expo 2020 closes its doors?</h4><p>We believe strongly in that part of the city regardless of Expo 2020, because it will be the site of Al Maktoum International Airport. And with Dubai being mainly an air and logistics hub, this will be the most important area of all. Expo 2020 is coming along well with that airport as a booster, but it's not the main attraction. The main attraction is what will become the largest airport in the world, the greatest logistics hub in the world, and the fact that you have one of the biggest airports being developed close to one of the greatest sea ports, adjacent in turn to one of the most active free zones in the region, means all three together spell a phenomenal opportunity for Dubai.</p><h4>What will Expo 2020 bring to the real estate and hospitality sector?</h4><p>Expo 2020 is essentially a sentiment booster. We need to be ready for the six-month Expo from a logistics perspective but, once again, it is not a major booster for real estate on its own. The Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing (DTCM) estimates that tourism growth alone necessitates a rise from today's 85,000 room keys to around 145,000 keys by 2020, even without the Expo. The Expo itself will only require an additional 15,000 rooms, which is a modest rise.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What was the strategy behind entering the Panamanian market?</h4><p>In July 2012, the company owners made the decision to open an insurance company in Panama, starting operations in 2013. Our operational license was received in late December 2012 paying an initial capital of $2 million. And when Panama's insurance legislation was amended in 2013, stipulating a higher initial capital of $5 million, the company had to rise to the challenge. We came to Panama based on the understanding that it had a tangible need for insurance services. Insurance in Panama today is different than in past years, when the offer was characterized by limited specialized insurance products available for the consumer market. There was a rather weak insurance culture in the country, which we decided to reinforce by incorporating a new insurance company.</p><h4>How do you differentiate yourselves from your competition?</h4><p>Competition is high in Panama because the brokers have fully penetrated the entire industry. One of the most important strengths our company has is our qualified staff. All of our employees have had previous experience at other companies. Insurance is a face-to-face business, but we also offer new and innovative products. If you pretend to sell the same as everyone else, you simply do not have any added value to incorporate into your product offering. We therefore developed a portfolio of tailor-made products. When we started out, we had seven products, and by the end of 2014 we expect to be selling more than 15. I think automotive and car insurance are the most demanded forms of coverage, but to that we might also add sureties, health, and individual life insurance.</p><div class="quote">“The insurance industry has improved, increasing by around 9% in 2013."</div><h4>What are the company's financial expectations for 2014?</h4><p>The board directors of the company are conservative. They have a mix of banking experience abroad, and technical expertise in the sale of insurance products. They also pursue conservative goals for the coming years. They do not expect to see major increases, believing, rather, that by the end of the year, we need to demonstrate not only that we have increased, but also that we are contributing positively to the sector.</p><h4>Why are there so many Venezuelan insurance companies in Panama?</h4><p>It is important to stress here that we are not just Venezuelans; we are a group of people from across the region. The company's capital is 100% Panamanian from Panamanian investors, but we also have a technical heritage in Venezuela.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the new insurance laws?</h4><p>The new law represents a great opportunity for all. We have good supervision that is technically qualified to regulate the entire market. The insurance regulators have also received training to expand their knowledge base.</p><h4>Which sectors of the economy most require insurance?</h4><p>Construction requires a major expansion of insurance uptake, particularly on projects related to the Panama Canal. We are actually not dealing with this issue because you need special qualifications to negotiate in the Panama Canal arena, which we currently do not possess.</p><h4>What are the prerequisites of establishing an insurance company in Panama?</h4><p>The initial capital investment needed to establish an insurance firm here is high. Yet in Colombia and Costa Rica, the initial amount an insurance company needs to pay to start operations is even greater. In Costa Rica, for example, it is $8 million. Thus, Panama offers somewhat of an advantage for foreign companies. Also, we have a strong financial center and many multinational reinsurers located in Panama</p><h4>What is your outlook for Panama in 2014?</h4><p>The insurance industry has improved, increasing by around 9% in 2013. It seems that everyone is pinning their hopes on Panama. And even though this is an election year, we are expecting to grow by 7%. I believe, incidentally, that Panama's political situation will remain favorable as long as it continues on the same path.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were last year's accomplishments for Akkord?</h4><p>Overall, 2013 was a challenging but, at the same time, successful year for Akkord Corporation in terms of sustainability. We have overcome all the challenges we faced through innovative thinking. The company has implemented some major projects on a national scale, including launching the first production line of the Gazakh Cement Plant, opening a multi-level, tunnel-type road junction in Galaba (Victory) Square in Baku, and signing a contract for the construction of a new Khatai Hazi Aslanov-2 section of the Baku Metro Green Line. These three large-scale projects became milestones for Akkord Corporation as it constantly strives to extend the frontiers of its activities. The company has also managed to break down stereotypes associated with its image as a solely construction-oriented company. It is noteworthy that launching the Gazakh Cement Plant comes in line with the implementation of the State Program for the Social and Economic Development of the Regions of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2009-2013, as it plays an important role in the socioeconomic development of both the Gazakh region and the country as a whole. Besides satisfying domestic cement demand, we are aiming to expand our global cement production footprint and become a regionally competitive cement producer. In addition to these achievements, in April 2013, Akkord Corporation was awarded Best Enterprise in the Field of Construction in the South Caucasus and Central Asia by the Institute of Directors at the Europe Business Assembly in London. Later that year, the company became a corporate affiliate member of the International Tunnelling and Underground Space Association (ITA-AITES) and World Road Association (PIARC). Akkord Corporation is the first and only private company from the South Caucasus that is affiliated to these highly reputable organizations.</p><h4>How is the Baku Metro project progressing?</h4><p>As for the Baku Metro project, metro tunneling and underground construction is a new business line for Akkord. A long-term conceptual development scheme for the Baku Metro that was prepared following a Presidential decree of November 10, 2008, and the State Program for the Development of the Baku Metro in 2011-2015, approved by a Presidential decree on March 18, 2011, has laid the groundwork for the Metro's expansion plans. To contribute to the program, Akkord Corporation has entered into a partnership with France's Bouygues Travaux Publics, which is one of the largest global experts in underground work. The contract, signed on December 16, 2013, has crowned our two-year joint efforts to develop the construction project for a new Khatai-Azi Aslanov-2 section of the “Green Line." In the future, we anticipate concluding more similar contracts, as the Metro development plan stipulates the construction of additional 50 stations. The company continuously develops its expertise in this area, so it could be involved in other relevant projects around the country.</p><div class="quote">“Akkord Corporation has a very strong presence not only in Azerbaijan but also in several foreign markets."</div><h4>What major undertakings are underway in 2014?</h4><p>Being not only a construction enterprise, but also a production and investment company, Akkord Corporation nowadays continues to invest heavily in the production and processing of building materials. The company's orientation to the country's manufacturing sector comes in line with President Ilham Aliyev's socio-economic development program for 2014-2018. The Head of State restated that the development of the non-oil sector remains Azerbaijan's top priority in the economic sphere this year and has declared 2014 the Year of Industry. As a leading building materials supplier, Akkord Corporation aims to support the President's decision and will continue to produce cement, concrete and concrete precasts, asphalt, marble, granite, steel structures, gravel, sand, bricks, and other materials not only for our own needs, but also for the wider market in Azerbaijan. This will be possible due to 40 manufacturing and processing facilities that the corporation owns and operates throughout the country. These facilities are located close to raw material sources and project sites, which allows us to enhance production efficiency and optimize project costs. We also have plans to increase the production of building materials, including fiber concrete, at our pre-fabrication plant. This year, such new entities as Gazakh Cement Plant, Akkord Prefabrik (precast concrete plant), Akkord Beton, and Garadag Marble and Granite Plant will commence operations within the Industry Group set by Akkord Corporation this February. Through heavy investments into industry and manufacturing, pioneering the application of new technologies and know-how, Akkord Corporation is making a substantial contribution to the development of the country's production sector and will adhere closely to this line of work. Besides that, Akkord Corporation has passed the pre-qualification stage to bid for the Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline (TANAP) project, and we plan to continue participating in tenders under this and Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) proj­ects.  The internationally recognized brand that Akkord Corporation has managed to build over the years enables the company to contribute to these projects, which will have profound impact on the world energy marketplace. I would like to stress that we are focused on bridging all the areas of our activity and building a sustainable business model. The scale of investment reflects Akkord Corporation's policy of vertical integration, and this policy and investment in production facilities that it requires will continue this year.</p><h4>What projects is Akkord working on abroad?</h4><p>Currently, Akkord Corporation has a very strong presence not only in Azerbaijan but also in several foreign markets including Turkey, Germany, Albania, Georgia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The success of our international projects is largely based on cooperation with leading construction and engineering companies through different forms of partnership. The corporation has reached agreements with some globally renowned companies, such as Hochtief and Bouguyes Travaux Publics, our partners in the joint venture for the Baku Metro project. Recently, the Azerbaijan-Italian Akkord-Todini-Impregilo Joint Venture has won the tender to implement road construction works under the CAREC III Corridor, Shymkent-Tashkent Project in Kazakhstan. Akkord Corporation has been participating in the Western Europe-Western China International Transit Corridor project since 2010. In total, the Corporation is implementing tens of high-complexity large infrastructure projects across the Caspian-Black Sea region.</p><h4>How important are human resources to Akkord?</h4><p>As one of the major employers in Azerbaijan, Akkord Corporation contributes significantly to the formation of a positive work environment and corporate culture. The corporation considers human capital as its most important asset to maintaining sustainable growth, and is doing its utmost to attract, retain, inspire, and motivate people working in the company. Nowadays, more than 4,000 employees including specialists from the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Portugal, Ukraine, Bangladesh, Russia, Georgia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Iran, and Turkey are involved in daily operations domestically and abroad, and the key objective for us is to have right motivation tools and to offer various benefits to enable them to perform at their best. The company is constantly striving to balance the needs of the business with its employees' expectations. We believe that all our employees add value to our business, and their contribution to our common success does not go unnoticed or remain undervalued. Thus, this year Akkord Corporation is starting an initiative to congratulate hundreds of employees working in the company for five years or more to recognize and praise their loyalty to the company and work for its prosperity. Akkord Corporation is investing heavily in manpower and is widely reputed as a company employing highly qualified personnel in every country where it operates. We are keen to deviate from a common practice in the construction sector to work with sub-contractors, because we believe that developing and training our own employees will be more beneficial in the long run when it comes to building a highly successful business, not only in profit, but also in culture.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the Mexican market for Airbus Group?</h4><p>Mexico is a particularly important and interesting market. Over the past 10 years, we have sold 186 aircraft in this market to three airlines: Interjet, Volaris, and VivaAerobus. Our forecast for Mexico is also impressive. According to the global market forecast published annually by Airbus, over the next 20 years Mexico will require 634 aircraft of more than 100 seat capacity. That is a huge market for us, and also in terms of homeland security, civil defense, and defense. On top of that, what is interesting about Mexico is that it is a growing industry; its aerospace sector has grown at an average of 15% per annum over the past decade and 20% over the past five years.</p><h4>How are you taking advantage of the boom in this sector?</h4><p>As a key part of this industry we have many suppliers that have developed a presence in Mexico. Probably the most important is the Safran Group, which has a plant in Chihuahua and manufactures a large proportion of the Airbus 380 harnesses. GE, too, is a huge provider for our Group, but we have many others in Mexico. We have developed our presence in Mexico with our facility of Airbus Helicopters in Querétaro. We have a sourcing base that is vital to our target of expansion in this area. We firmly believe that Mexico is the place to be today for aeronautics. In our Group, we have identified Mexico as one of the top sourcing countries in the world.</p><div class="quote">“When we invest in a country, many of our suppliers are keen to invest as well."</div><h4>What are your expectations for the coming years?</h4><p>If we look at our presence here directly, we generate about 380 direct jobs and about 5,000 indirect jobs with suppliers. The employment potential of the aeronautics industry is particularly compelling, especially for qualified technicians. The target is to develop this over the next few years, and we aim to be employing around 10,000 people indirectly by 2020.</p><h4>How will you increase Mexican competitiveness?</h4><p>One of the subsidiaries of Airbus Group, Airbus Defense &amp; Space Mexico, has been recognized the last three consecutive years as the top employer in Mexico with the benchmark of the best HR practices in the country. This confirms that whatever country we happen to be present in, we are dedicated to the best practices in terms of human resources and staff development. Indeed, developing the team and exporting talent is crucial for Airbus. We have sent more than 40 technicians and engineers from Mexico to Germany for training at our facilities. They return to Querétaro knowing how to produce the emergency doors of the Airbus A320 that we are manufacturing there in the Airbus Helicopters plant.</p><h4>How does this plant contribute to regional development?</h4><p>When we invest in a country, many of our suppliers are keen to invest as well; in that sense, we are in a position to boost the sector broadly. This is crucial to the future of aerospace in Mexico. In fact, we work in an industry of very few major players. For aircraft of over 100-seat capacity there are only two players. If we look at the financial figures of 2013, the total backlog of our group was ‚¬686.7 billion on December 31, 2013. This means that our Group, in terms of backlog, represents more or less half of Mexican GDP. For a country like Mexico, having a strong relationship with a Group like ours is therefore key for the future development of its aeronautic industry. We contribute investment and push our supply chain to be part of Mexico. We also invite others to participate here in Mexico. We have a very good relationship with ProMéxico. We are working closely with the Mexican authorities to promote the Mexico of today, and the opportunities to invest here for tomorrow.</p><h4>What is the performance of your green programs?</h4><p>We were in fact one of the first companies to introduce green programs. In 2010, we worked with the Mexican government, specifically with Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (ASA), Interjet, and the Safran Group, to produce some Interjet Airbus flights with biofuel produced in Mexico, which has proved to be a real success. Now, we expect a bright future for biofuel in this industry. This said, our job was merely to demonstrate biofuel's feasibility, and now the job of the politicians is to demonstrate that it can indeed become a valuable commodity for the economy.</p><h4>How do you feel about the energy reform?</h4><p>I would like to say that our Group was very impressed by the efforts of the current administration and the congress in 2013. Being able to achieve labor, telecoms, education, fiscal, financial, and energy reforms in just one year requires a highly mature political environment. We see the energy reforms as the best tool to increase the competitiveness of the country, by reducing domestic energy prices. I believe that the real challenge for Mexico is to not be competitive against China or India, but to remain competitive with the US. In my opinion, the energy reforms will contribute to this. Due to the low cost of energy in the US, it is booming again. It is a manufacturing economy, and Mexico has to be part of that and remain a key player for the US. This will be the direct impact of the energy reforms. For sure, if the energy reforms can increase GDP by 2% per annum, it would enhance economic performance notably. We are enthusiastic about what is happening in Mexico, and I am personally convinced that this is Mexico's moment.</p><h4>How will Mexico's trade relationship with the US develop?</h4><p>The two economies are deeply connected to such an extent that this will surely follow, and Mexico is also extending bridges with other continents, such as Europe. Our company is proof that links with Europe are growing. Don't forget that the Airbus Group is really a European company with French, German, and Spanish participations, as well as UK interests. The success of Airbus in Mexico is clear evidence of the fact that there are many bonds between Mexico and Europe.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does the UAE's Green Economy Initiative encourage economic growth?</h4><p>The Emirates Green Development Strategy launched by HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE, and Ruler of Dubai, in January 2012, seeks to achieve economic objectives with the target of community development by creating job opportunities through the development of sustainable growth. This strategy will enhance the competitiveness of the state economy, reduce financial burdens on the government, and enhance the state's image as a leading investment destination by attracting green investments, enhancing economic diversification, and establishing new innovation- and technology-based projects and industries. All this, in turn, should make the UAE a global center for the export and re-export of green products and technologies.</p><h4>How have local businesses responded to the Environmental Performance Card (EPC) program, and what dividends has it reaped for the country?</h4><p>The EPC was granted to 10 industrial businesses in 2009, 25 in 2010, 37 in 2011, and 55 in 2012, while the Ministry targeted about 70 businesses nationwide in 2013. The response from industry has generally been good, backed by the cooperation of competent local authorities. The initiative will encourage industrial businesses to compete in compliance with environmental initiatives to conserve the environment and maintain sustainable development to the advantage of the nation in general; especially given the UAE government adopts the green economy approach as well.</p><div class="quote">“We are aware of the importance of our marine wealth."</div><h4>What ministerial policies contributed to the UAE receiving an improved performance rating, as well as the best ranking of any GCC country in Yale University's 2012 Environmental Performance Index (EPI)?</h4><p>The Ministry of Environment and Water (MOEW) adopted the Strategic Plan 2011-2013 for the improvement of the country's EPI listing as a part of the objective to enhance environmental security, which is one of the five strategic objectives of the Ministry. In this regard, it has laid down a set of initiatives and plans with a view to improving the national position in this index, such as improving the level of protection of biological zones and fragile environments, the application of the integrated management of desertification, and improving the ecological footprint index, among others.</p><h4>What is the UAE's plan for handling long-term water stress, given projections of sustained population growth here (especially in Abu Dhabi) and rising water scarcity across the Middle East?</h4><p>The management of water resources, especially the provision of fresh water and the services related to potable water, is a matter of international priority that has a growing importance in the light of increasing pressures and challenges to water resources worldwide, such as the increasing demand on water and the challenges of waste, depletion, and pollution. These pressures are aggravated with the impact of climate change on water resources. In the UAE, the water issue has always been paid particular attention since the beginning of the comprehensive development of the country in the early 1970s. As far as future planning of water resources is concerned, the UAE seeks to ensure the sustainability of its water security by integrating the management of the available limited natural water resources and non-traditional water. This includes the sustainability of the strategic industry of seawater desalination as a source of fresh water by focusing on modern desalination technologies, the use of sources of renewable and alternative energies, and the sound environmental management of water from desalination stations. In this respect, a reference can be made to the national strategy on the conservation of water resources, which is a 10-year strategy and adopts the drivers and policies of demand managed by rationing the use and conservation of water in all sectors, prepared by the Ministry in 2010 and approved by the Cabinet. We also have legislation prohibiting the export of water filled from groundwater sources. The Ministry's current operating plan approves a strategic indicator concerned with cutting demand for groundwater, which is being implemented in coordination with the Ministry's partner agencies through developing agricultural policies that target cutting water consumption in the agriculture sector, which is the main consumer of groundwater in the UAE.</p><h4>How does MOEW contribute to the development of agriculture and aquaculture and work toward improving sustainable food security in the UAE?</h4><p>We are aware of the importance of our marine wealth. In addition to its economic and social importance, it also contributes to enhancing food security, as well as helping people to earn a living in the community segments working in fishing and related occupations. Fish farming in the UAE will grow over the coming years, especially upon the completion of the Khalifa Bin Zayed Center for Marine Research. The productivity of the Center will rise from 200,000 fish fingerlings currently to about 10 million in addition to the development of operations in the field of scientific research and studies of fish wealth. Additionally, the Ministry seeks to motivate more private-sector institutions to invest in this promising industry, which is the world's fastest growing sector of animal food production in terms of security. In regard to agriculture, we have established guidance units and veterinary clinics with technical cadres to cover all parts of the country and to serve farmers and animal breeders free of charge. Thanks to these efforts, the number of farms rose from 4,000 in the early 1970s to 40,574 in 2011, and cultivated area jumped from 3,000 hectares in 1968 to 115,150 hectares in 2011, while agricultural production reached 2.1 million tons in 2010. The farmers are supported annually with agricultural production supplies for 50% of the cost price to encourage agricultural production and enhance food safety. This system had reached about 700 protected houses for aquatic agricultural systems over an area of 191,000 sqm by the end of 2012, compared to only 10 locations in 2009. This is thanks to the MOEW's effort to introduce aquatic agriculture technology into the sector. What's more, MOEW has adopted initiatives to contribute to agriculture development, such as the palm initiative. Livestock is also an important issue, and the MOEW works through its 21 veterinary clinics and 60 veterinaries covering all parts of the country to provide treatment, vaccines, and guidance free of charge to animal breeders in order to protect local wealth from disease and enhance its contribution to local production. Regarding food safety, since 80% of the state's foodstuff is imported, the MOEW considers food safety the key priority with a view to circulating sound consumable food products by issuing legislation and resolutions regulating food safety. These include resolutions on control over agricultural and veterinary quarantine points, import prohibition or prohibition lifting resolutions, resolutions regulating animal production farms, and regarding unified work guidelines, including the uniform guide to food prohibition and prohibition lifting procedures. In addition, a federal law on food safety is currently under development.</p><h4>How does the UAE hosting a number of international events related to clean energy, sustainability, and the environment contribute to the country's development?</h4><p>By hosting international conferences and gatherings on the environment, sustainable development, and energy, we reinforce our commitment to participate actively in international endeavors to address the causes of environmental problems and find sustainable solutions to them. The UAE has been approved as a regional and international platform to discuss the main issues nationally, regionally, and internationally. It also highlights the attention of the wise leadership to the issues of the environment, energy, and sustainable development. The contribution of these international conferences and gatherings in enhancing the efforts of sustainable development in the UAE mainly comes in the form of gathering an elite body of leading policy and decision makers, as well as competent officials, in both the public and private sectors. This opens the door to important opportunities for building partnerships, exchanging experiences and perspectives, as well as assessing and building state-of-the-art systems, technologies, and practices; for example, the Abu Dhabi Sustainability Week Dubai Global Energy Forum and Abu Dhabi-headquartered International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> Where does Saudi Arabia fit in Zain's regional strategy?</h4><p>Saudi Arabia is one of the most important markets for Zain Group, from both a volume and value perspective. Today, after five years of operations, we are proud to serve 8.5 million subscribers each and every day. From a revenues perspective, we are the largest operating company in Zain Group, although we have by far the lowest market share in Saudi Arabia. This makes Saudi Arabia the biggest growth opportunity within the Group. We were fortunate to start our operations in Saudi Arabia with the latest in mobile telecommunications technology. In fact, we were awarded the first mobile telecommunications license in Saudi Arabia that allowed the use of 4G mobile technology.</p><h4>How do you plan to build on the progress Zain has seen here in order to push the company forward in the coming years?</h4><p>The way that we communicate continues to change. Today, our customers make more use of smartphones, apps, and our fast data network than ever before. We live in a rapidly changing world, where advances in technology have enabled us all to communicate more often, in a radically different way than before. Zain plays a vital part in enabling this communications revolution. Critical to our success is that we offer our customers the best possible customer experience and that our customers genuinely perceive that we care. Our customers continue to rely more and more on our services to keep in touch with their family and friends, as well as be a source of information and entertainment. We understand that mobile data communication is uniquely relevant in Saudi Arabia, and in response to our customer's demands, we have optimized our network to provide a best-in-class user experience when accessing social networking sites and streaming video services, such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.</p><div class="quote">“We would like to adapt all the applications and services of the world to our local culture to preserve our Saudi Arabian identity."</div><h4>What about Arab-language content and the creation of applications in the country?</h4><p>In the Saudi Arabian market, we believe we have to preserve our culture. We would like to adapt all the applications and services of the world to our local culture to preserve our Saudi Arabian identity. This is what we will be doing, and I believe that the country can be an important generator of Arabic and Islamic content. By having the correct telecommunications infrastructure, mobile services will extend into banking, media, television, agriculture, education, and health.</p><h4>Where do you hope to take Zain by the end of your tenure?</h4><p>Each time we reach a milestone, we think that we have made enough progress, only to then discover that there is more to be achieved. A telecommunications operator is an enabler; whatever the country needs and whatever Saudi Arabian citizens need, it is our duty to provide it. Saudi Arabia is number one in terms of Twitter users globally, and we have 90 million views on YouTube per day originating here. This places us under pressure to deal with such colossal growing demand.</p><h4>How has mobile telephony changed?</h4><p>I am proud of the fact that since the first cellular telephone call on April 3, 1973, this industry has grown to support over 7 billion connections, approximately one for every inhabitant on the planet. During this time, I have seen the industry evolve into the dynamic customer-experience centric environment it is today. As mobile operators, we all have access to the same technology as our competition, we excel in the way we delight our customers, and provide the best-in-class voice, data, and video mobile communications.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In which segments is ATEF involved in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>Our predecessor, the Baku Transformer Plant (BTP), was founded in 1961 and was relatively small; it employed about 50 people and solely manufactured dry-type transformers. This type of transformer was in high demand because of all the nuclear power plants at that time in our country, while other plants, which were built with the support of the USSR and other friendly countries, also used dry-type transformers. In 1995, after taking up a position on the Board of Directors, other members of the board and I developed a new model to develop the company. As a result, BTP dramatically increased its product range and, in 2002, was transformed into ATEF Group, which now consists of more diversified production lines and consists of five plants. Nowadays, ATEF Group employs more than 1,000 employees to develop and manufacture goods, plan and implement various complex projects, and tailor a wide range of services both for individual orders and for large-size orders. The list of countries receiving our export products exceeds 20. We used to produce only dry-type transformers, but now we also produce oil-type power transformers and switchgears. In addition, we have built another factory for heavy metals production. Our company is involved in transmitting and distributing electricity, but is currently not engaged in power generation. Thus, in 18 years ATEF Group has undergone the kind of radical changes it takes other companies 30-40 years to emulate. Today, ATEF Group is one of the major companies in the Southern Caucasus, which in addition to producing and supplying the entire spectrum of electrical products, also deploys turnkey projects.</p><h4>What is ATEF Group's position in the power sector?</h4><p>ATEF Group is one of the key companies in Azerbaijan, and is completely specialized in the productive sector. ATEF Group is one of the major companies in Azerbaijan and provides turnkey projects for the construction, design, manufacture, and installation of electrical products. We are currently producing power and distribution oil transformers up to 100 megavolt-ampere (MVA) with voltage up to 110 kilovolt-amps (kVa), dry power and converter transformers as well as molded epoxy insulation with power up to 12.5 MVA and voltage up to 35 kVa, complete distribution devices, open and closed-type switchgears, complete transformer substations (CTS), traction substations for above- and below-ground railways, and metal production of any complexity.</p><div class="quote">“ATEF Group is one of the key companies in Azerbaijan, and is completely specialized in the productive sector."</div><h4>What do your international operations consist of?</h4><p>We have offices in 11 countries, and export to 20 countries. Exports formerly accounted for 70% to 80% of our production. However, since winning the contract for the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars project, they now account for approximately 50%. We have commenced the construction of a new distribution transformer plant in Kazakhstan in the Economic Free Zone, and in the future we will expand to build factories in Russia, Turkey, and maybe within the GCC region.</p><h4>How do you identify potential customers?</h4><p>Apart from doing business with our regular customers, we also attract customers from international expos. In 2013, thanks to the efforts of Samruk Energy, ATEF Group is involved in building power lines and substation projects in Kazakhstan. The Azerbaijani government is our major customer and we have contracts with such government agencies as SOCAR, the Baku Electric Network, the railway network, and the Social Fund for the Development of Internally Displaced Persons (SFDI). ATEF Group has provided substations to towns built for internally displaced persons by the SFDI. We find that clients return to us having experienced our ability to deploy projects.</p><h4>What projects have you been working on in recent years?</h4><p>One of our biggest projects to date has been the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway connection, which runs from Baku to Boyuk Kesik in Azerbaijan over a distance of 500 kilometers. The project consists of 12 traction substations and catenary lines. Baku—Boyuk Kesik is a work in progress. In addition, rehabilitation works are also being carried out by ATEF in Georgia on the Tbilisi-Kars section of the project.</p><h4>To what extent do you feel that your company is representing Azerbaijan itself in the international arena?</h4><p>Until recent years, Azerbaijan has been known as an oil and gas producer and exporter and as an agricultural country. Recently, Azerbaijan's high-tech equipment in the energy sector has been gaining a worldwide reputation. The Azerbaijani government pays special attention to the development of the non-oil and gas sector, and at the same time facilitates the production and export of domestically produced products. We are expanding our production and we are now finishing our fifth plant, a state-of-the-art facility where the production of large power transformers up to 500 MVA with voltages of 220-500 kVa will take place. The factory is equipped with the high-tech machinery of leading manufacturers such as GEORG, Hedrich (Germany), Sagma (Italy), and Highvolt (Switzerland). We will gear the production at this plant toward larger markets and at the same time boost the country's demand for strategic goods.</p><h4>How do you go about using raw materials and commercializing your products?</h4><p>We import raw materials from the UK, the EU, the US, Turkey, Russia, and Kazakhstan. For example, we import H1-grade magnetic steel from AK STEEL (US), which is a high-grade steel produced at very few facilities in the world. It is a major component of transformers, and thus quality manufacturing is of the essence. Good quality comes at a premium, but for us there is no option but the best available. The main goal of ATEF Group is to get good market shares in places such as the UK, Europe, and the US.</p><h4>How would you define the skill level of your employees?</h4><p>We have many excellent engineers from the Soviet period. At the same time, we heavily invest in our employees by sending them abroad to develop their skill set, improve their know-how, and ramp up their experience. Our employees attend monthly and annual seminars and training programs. Moreover, we also participate in cooperation programs with companies such as Siemens, ABB, and GE.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you characterize Mozambique's role within the Community of Portuguese Language Countries (CPLP)?</h4><p>The performance of the pro tempore presidency of the CPLP during Mozambique's tenure reveals the importance of the potential contributions of the CPLP to face future challenges on a global scale, in step with social and economic development. In the context of the theme of the Mozambican presidency, “Food and Nutrition Security," Mozambique oversaw the constitution of a Council of Food and Nutrition Security of the CPLP. We follow a strategic plan to ensure alignment on the issue of food sovereignty, and a memorandum with the FAO, to be embodied in the “Together Against Hunger" program, which raises awareness and funds for projects to combat hunger and malnutrition in our countries. Our vision is of a community of countries with a healthy and active human capital, free from hunger and poverty in a context of progressive realization of the human right to adequate food and respect for national sovereignty.</p><h4>How has the recent surge of investment in Mozambique's mineral resources sector affected its economic relationship with the countries of the CPLP?</h4><p>I believe that this can only strengthen Mozambique, the CPLP, and its member states. There are about 250 million Portuguese speakers— by 2050 this is expected to have reached 323 million—on four continents, and countries of high economic potential. In terms of economic potential, Brazil is in the BRICS group; Angola and Mozambique, which may become the sixth largest gas producer after the US, Canada, Russia, Iran, and Qatar, with growth rates of around 8%; and East Timor, which also has prospects of high double-digit growth rates, thanks to oil and natural gas. In this area, Brazil, Angola, and Mozambique represent over 50% of oil discoveries made over the past eight years. The economies of CPLP countries, accompanied by Mozambique, enjoy considerable growth potential. I believe that these optimistic prospects should encourage policymakers to address the challenges and opportunities of growth and development toward an economic transformation of member countries supported by growth across a diversity of sectors—extractive, agriculture, and industry. The economic rise of countries should also create better employment opportunities that support growth more inclusively.</p><div class="quote">“CPLP member states are active on four continents and in diverse areas of regional cooperation."</div><h4>What role has the CPLP played in promoting development cooperation in Africa?</h4><p>CPLP member states are active on four continents and in diverse areas of regional cooperation; this factor contributes to the richness of our cultural diversity, the expansion of the common language, and multifaceted and intensive cooperation. Moreover, in regard to the integration policies of CPLP member states, this dispersion is a colossal challenge, but an enormous source of opportunities for the future. I underline the importance of knowledge in the matter of progress. Increasingly, a country's progress is connected to knowledge. Education and training occupy a privileged place in cooperation between Portuguese-speaking countries. It is worth noting the strong cooperation between institutes of higher education that has developed among CPLP states. The development of higher education in the PALOPs and East Timor has been remarkable, with a significant increase in official and private institutions. This idea reinforces the importance of movement and mobility agreements. I have also paid special attention to relations between CPLP and civil society organizations. Since the beginning of my mandate, I have placed a priority on the approximation of the Executive Secretariat to civil society and its organizations, for a reason that seems obvious: CPLP is a community-building project that should primarily be a space of citizenship, inclusion, and dialogue. Only then will we have the means of supporting development.</p><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive investment destination for investors from other CPLP countries?</h4><p>Mozambique shares with CPLP countries its historic past and common objectives that are underpinned by the Portuguese language. It shares the same regional area of economic integration with Angola, the SADC, and is highly committed to the constant sharing of knowledge among our communities. Mozambique has revealed markedly high, sustainable economic growth, reflecting a skilled national workforce that is capable and applied.</p><h4>What are the main goals and priorities during your tenure as Executive Secretary of the CPLP?</h4><p>In 2013, within the scope of my mandate, I have already made official visits to the member states of Angola, Sío Tomé and Prí­ncipe, Cape Verde, and East Timor, before the Council of Ministers in July 2013. I have still not visited Guinea-Bissau given the political situation in the country, although CPLP international missions have been there. We must not forget that ours is a community composed of countries the development of which is quite varied, and ultimately we will be judged on our ability to walk at the same pace. However, I am very optimistic. I hope to receive approval for the next CPLP Summit, in July 2014, of a document that will serve as a roadmap for organizational and policy changes. These changes will make the CPLP a common project, and will include a mobilizing strategy with a definition of stable goals as a guide to the organization in the pursuit of excellence for our populations.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What growth potential does TPAO see in Turkey?</h4><p>TPAO certainly has further room for growth, and we plan to be worth around $50 billion to the state by end-2013. We're looking to transform the company and become more flexible in quick decision-making. This requires a partial overhaul of Turkey's regulatory environment. Firstly, however, we must be perfectly clear about what we could do to improve, and only then must we approach the government regarding its own responsibilities in the equation. Over the past 10 years, GDP has risen from around $250 billion to approximately $800 billion. In parallel with this growth, TPAO's total investments and total revenue have jumped to $8.2 billion and $18 billion, respectively, over the last decade. What's more, only around 15% of potential offshore reserves have been explored, which is negligible. For instance, TPAO has the most licenses in the Mediterranean Sea, which is approximately 150,000 square kilometers, as well as owning 40% of the Black Sea coastline.  There is also great potential in this respect, both conventional and unconventional, especially in the southeast and the Thracian region of Turkey, where our colleagues from the exploration department are currently working. A small team is set to commence drilling in the Thrace Basin at the beginning of 2014. Turkey, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), has a production potential of 20 trillion cubic feet of shale gas and oil, indicating that this area deserves very some serious attention. Furthermore, Turkey is located between major energy producers and consumers. Its geopolitical position also makes it unique as a transit country. The transportation and distribution of energy resources to the market is now as important as oil production. All these advantages make TPAO a partner of choice for companies interested in major hydrocarbon undertakings in Turkey and abroad.</p><h4>What makes the Black Sea an attractive opportunity for foreign oil companies?</h4><p>The Black Sea has many sound leads and prospective indices, as well as robust oil and gas infrastructure. Basically, it is an attractive region simply because of its sheer core potential. We want to cooperate with other companies in the region to fully develop it. There is also notable potential in the Black Sea region, where Turkey has 400,000 square kilometers of coastline. So far, only five deep-sea wells have been drilled. In the North Sea, the full extent of oil reserves was only discovered after drilling 35 wells. Turkey has spent around $400 million gaining seismic data from the Black Sea, subsequently inviting multinationals such as Shell, ExxonMobil, and Petrobras to offer their opinions. We have developed lasting relationships and begun work on wells. We incurred a capital expenditure of $250 million on one well, while the other participating companies accounted for the remaining $1.3 billion.</p><h4>How would you characterize the importance for Turkey of partnering foreign investors?</h4><p>We have developed some solid projects with Shell in the western Black Sea, and also close to Antalya on the Mediterranean coast. We are also working solo on a project near Iskenderun, where we have started drilling, and are planning around 10 wells in the Mediterranean over the next four to five years. In the past we have drilled a number of wells near Iskenderun and Mersin, at the time having seen some oil and gas potential, but we are keen to revisit the area to reassess the feasibility of production. Meanwhile, we are also working on the licensed blocks of Northern Cyprus. Israel, too, has also made discoveries in Southern Cyprus and in 1Q2014 offshore development is set to commence. We have very good partners in Shell, and we want to work together on the transportation of gas through Turkey. Participation in this project could also serve to improve our relations with Israel. It would also further relations with Cyprus, especially in terms of water and electricity. In this context we may also talk of Iraq, where we have four firm ongoing projects, with two apiece in oil and gas. The technical conditions in that market are challenging, but we have committed to a significant investment of $6 million.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in Turkey?</h4><p>It is vital to meet Turkey's increasing energy demand for sustainable economic growth. Properly analyzing recent energy policies as well as changing business conditions to develop a pro-active strategy, we have revised our master plan. Our main strategy is to establish consortia with major companies, sharing risks and transferring know-how and technology, and buy into a company at an oil-producing field abroad to increase our total reserves and revenues. To that end, we have established companies in various countries and want to boost ties with international oil companies through the project management model. After discussions with the related ministry and other partners, we will make public our master plan in early 2014. Our passion for our country, our faith in our staff, our perserverance, and our belief in success are our source of motivation to contribute to creating a stronger Turkey on the road to being one of the world's major economies. We are already very fortunate in terms of our highly qualified personnel, not least our engineers, and I'm optimistic for the future.</p><div class="quote">“It is vital to meet Turkey's increasing energy demand for sustainable economic growth."</div><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Nar Mobile poised to benefit competitively from mobile number portability (MNP), which has just taken effect?</h4><p>Our advantage lies in the exceptional value that we offer to the consumers. We have continued our efforts to improve and upgrade our network. Our network in the capital and surrounding areas is extremely strong, and we continue to work on improving it in the adjacent regions as well. Coupled with this solid network, we also have a very attractive portfolio of tariff plans, which lets consumers find a plan that matches their usage, thus delivering exceptional value. I think that people who have had their numbers for a long time and would like to continue to keep their numbers will be interested in taking a hard look at us.</p><h4>How are your efforts at improving connectivity in rural areas progressing?</h4><p>In the regions, we have expanded the number of base stations that we have in the network, and we are also employing some of the most modern technologies in the world to provide better coverage. During 2014 and in particular in 2Q2014, I think that consumers will see the effects of the efforts we have made over the last six to nine months. These new technologies will allow us better control of our radio signal in the base stations, thereby giving us a broader reach. It will also allow us to take advantage of additional base stations.</p><div class="quote">“Innovation is not always about the newest product; it is also about providing a set of services and tariffs in a unique way."</div><h4>Looking at 2013 overall, what progress was Nar Mobile able to make in terms of increasing its customer base?</h4><p>I will illustrate this through three facts. The first is that our subscriber base grew by more than 10%, and I am fairly certain that we are the only operator that had this kind of growth in 2013. Our revenue was also up by roughly 25%, which outpaced the growth of our two competitors combined. Our data traffic, which will increasingly be a key driver of telecoms revenue in the future, saw an increase of 130% in a single year. All three of those are outstanding indicators of the kind of growth that we have and the number of customers that are already moving to Nar Mobile. That is why we are very optimistic as we continue to focus on the fundamentals. We have a great network, and offer great value and customer service. On the customer service side, we have seen a dramatic jump in our customer satisfaction ratings over the past year. This is an area that we are emphasizing and continue to want to improve.</p><h4>What does your change in corporate strategy entail?</h4><p>We started by establishing a five-year mission for what we want to achieve. We discussed a common set of values by which we want to run the company and that we want people to embrace in their daily dealings. We identified six specific strategies that we are going to use to build our business for the next three to five years. Now we will focus on executing the strategy. Delivering on the execution begins by aligning the management team and the entire company around the strategy. We developed the strategy in April 2013, fine-tuned it in May, and deployed it in June. We gave presentations to all of our employees. I believe that it was a huge contributor to the results that we have achieved during the past year.</p><h4>What initiatives best articulate Nar Mobile's drive for innovation?</h4><p>Innovation is not always about the newest product; it is also about providing a set of services and tariffs in a unique way. We have simplified our portfolio, meaning that we have six tariffs for voice and, within those, we can meet any basic needs that consumers might have. If you want a simple price, for everything, then Unique is the tariff for you, because it only costs four kopeck for any domestic call. If you want to talk to many people on the Nar network, then we have an unlimited tariff, which for a few kopecks a day delivers outstanding value. We find that consumers really flock to this tariff and love it, as it is one of our most stable tariffs. Beyond tariffs, we announced a really important initiative at Bakutel, which is Nar Home. We will provide a number of services in the home including television, video libraries, home monitoring, and a home network, allowing people in the same home to talk to each other through the set-top box. Family photos and video libraries can be accessed by any person in the family or anyone you want to give access. There is also the ability to have complete connectivity between the set-top box and your phone. Most of those products can be found on the market today; however, nobody bundles them into a single package or makes it as easy to use as we are making it. When you then tie that to the phone, it then becomes a great conduit for a stream of innovation on the handset.</p><h4>What are the priorities for Nar Mobile's corporate social responsibility (CSR) platform?</h4><p>We have supported a number of charities through the years. First, we have a program to build awareness and hire hearing- and speech-impaired staff. This program has been ongoing for about three or four years, and we have 12 hearing- or speech-impaired employees. We have provided opportunities for work, and even increased their responsibilities in some cases. We have also developed an educational program to teach them how to use the Microsoft Office suite. Second, we have added a focus on art and culture. As a visitor and a guest here in Azerbaijan, I can frankly say that there is a very rich cultural heritage that we would like to help celebrate, not only in terms of what is here but also bringing in international stars. Third, education is important because it is the future of the country. We are hoping to work closely with the Ministry of Education on several ideas that we have to help drive various educational initiatives.</p><h4>What about training programs?</h4><p>One of the initiatives we started a year ago was an internship program. Our interns are provided with training and development. We are then able to look at that group as a great source of future employees for the company. In addition to that, we started a program called Nar Excellence. It includes initiatives such as 360-degree feedback, meaning that each employee gets feedback from about a dozen people that they work with, including their boss, peers, and subordinates. Through this tool, we try to identify what each employee needs to do to improve. In 2014, we will launch a leadership development program that will focus on the top-100 people in the company as the first step. We will conduct very detailed assessments of everyone to identify where our strengths are and what developments can be made. We have two or three different companies already lined up to provide various training programs to help us achieve our goals. In total, we will invest about AZN1,000 per employee on training and development. A great example of how these efforts are paying off is that several members of our IT staff went abroad, either sponsored by us or on their own accord to study. About 20 of these were given awards or certifications in 2013 for reaching certain levels of excellence. One of them passed Oracle's highest level of certification in his first attempt, and he is now one of the top-200 Oracle experts in the world.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you elaborate on the success Colombia's government has achieved with its transversal policies?</h4><p>We are implementing a digital revolution in Colombia; an inclusive revolution for all Colombians, especially those of limited economic means in rural areas of the country. This revolution is geared at broadening internet penetration and reducing the cost of access. For example, we increased the percentage of connected Colombian households from 17% to the current 50%, an increase that has had a significant impact on lower-income families. This digital revolution also includes Colombian SMEs, with the percentage of connected companies exceeding 60% today. The digital revolution also impacts education; we plan to distribute 2 million computer units to decrease the current computer deficit from one computer per 24 schoolchildren to one computer for every four schoolchildren. The digital revolution is also linked to public workers and the increase of available e-services. For example, Colombia is a leading country in terms of e-government in the region. Colombia's digital revolution also encourages responsible web usage. For example, we are active in taking measures against children's internet addiction and work on training people to spot the risks and take preventative measures. Thanks to the digital revolution, we also boosted entrepreneurship among Colombians and we are educating as many as 55,000 entrepreneurs as a result of our program. In fact, for our country it is very important to meet the potential of new technologies thanks to the pool of skilled and creative young people we have. There has also been a notable impact for farmers and rural communities in general, where we have set up 7,000 community centers, known as “Digital Kiosks," that boost connectivity in rural Colombia.  We will have a fiber internet connection in all our municipalities in 2014. I would also add that our digital revolution includes the disabled, in a bid to increase their participation in daily life, and thus we have nationwide programs to boost inclusiveness in society through new technologies.</p><h4>How significant is the position of Chief Information Officer, which the Ministry is promoting?</h4><p>A key strategy of our social transformation is the clear presentation of what areas are being groomed for improvement. In this context, we created a position within the Ministry to structure and coordinate information delivery by the government. These systems are updated, secured, and compatible, and discourage irregularity. They bring together CEOs from public institutions under one umbrella. And today, we are in the process of training these individuals and defining a stronger working structure.</p><div class="quote">“We are implementing a digital revolution in Colombia; an inclusive revolution for all Colombians."</div><h4>Colombia stands out as a leading country in technological applications. What have been the main achievements in this field?</h4><p>Colombia is a regional exemplar when it comes to policy on new technologies, as well as socially inclusive policies. Our main goal is to reduce poverty and create employment by leveraging state-of-the-art technologies. In this regard, we have achieved much by connecting with lower social income groups, and need to provide them with tools to further promote development. The value of the internet is not connectivity per se, but the applications it can deliver. Yet on a global level, the applications currently available don't target our main goal, which is to reduce poverty. Therefore, we have a great potential as a country; we have already provided connectivity to the poorer sections of society and are now promoting the development of tailor-made applications with which to do this. I firmly believe that Colombia has the potential to become internationally recognized in this field in the near future, and expect our applications to be exported worldwide.</p><h4>What will be the main benefits of the nationwide implementation of 4G technologies?</h4><p>Recently, we carried out a kind of auction in the 4G field that brought more competition to the sector (from three operators to six) and we have also managed to draft a clearer and more commercially attractive regulatory framework. In this context, operators have already started working and will be able to reach a diversity of social groups across all cities, while also boosting the wider take up of new technologies. This strong interest from operators shows the potential of this segment of the industry, which in the near future will see key advances in the technological development of society.</p><h4>In your opinion, how beneficial can the Pacific Alliance be for the IT industry?</h4><p>I think we have a great opportunity to create a single, common IT market within the Pacific Alliance. In other words, to export the local benefits from users in these countries to a regional level and render them universal for all consumers. We should work to create a common digital market for all these countries where consumers, regardless of their location, enjoy uniform benefits when using their mobiles or purchasing items online.</p><h4>What were the main achievements of the Ministry's “computers to educate" program?</h4><p>It achieved something very important: a highlighting of the role that new technologies can play in improving national education levels. However, we should keep one thing in mind, namely that providing schools with computers and tablets is only useful if there is a robust strategy behind it to train teachers and provide them with effective tools to actually improve education. In this context, one of the program's lasting achievements is greater public awareness of the potential of new technologies. As a result, we are effectively boosting innovation in the education sector.</p><h4>How is the policy of subsidizing studies on new technologies structured in Colombia?</h4><p>The most important consideration to our thinking is to develop talent among our large young population, clearly our nation's greatest advantage. In this context, we try to bring together both things and make sure the country has a deep pool of talent in the IT sector. For example, we run a national program in which students receive programming training at 350 high schools, and where we provide loans to pursue IT-related careers. In fact today, over 5,000 students benefit from these loans, which are non-repayable where studies lead to the development of an actual application for local or national authorities and institutions.</p><h4>What is Colombia's potential to become a regional IT hub?</h4><p>Our country has the potential to attract companies such as Microsoft or Google to establish research centers. I think many people already view Colombia as the research and testing center to develop applications that tackle socio-economic problems that leverage the young population.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Why did you establish an office in Panama, and what are the main services you offer clients here?</h4><p>We set up an office in Panama one year ago to be closer to the local client base. Panama is, and has historically been, a regional hub for financial services in the region. It has strong regulations and legislation for the financial services industry. In addition, there are many qualified people here that we get to work with. All these factors make Panama attractive for us. We have two licenses: a representative office license and an advisory office license. These enable us to provide advisory services to clients regarding investments.</p><h4>What makes you different from other international banks operating in Panama?</h4><p>What sets us apart from other wealth managers in Panama is that our owners are also our managers. In any publicly listed bank, the owners are the shareholders while the managers are just managers. The CEOs do not own the bank they manage. Our owners are heavily involved in all the strategic decisions the bank makes. This allows us to take a wider perspective and a longer-term view, which means we are always looking ahead to the next generation. Our clients value this independence. We have been around for more than 200 years, and we want to be in business for another 200 years. This view impacts every level of our organization, in terms of what we want to offer our clients. Everything we do is with a long-term view in mind. People like what we provide and appreciate the stability. That's an important difference for both our clients and our staff. Besides that, our business just focuses on wealth management for private and institutional clients. We don't do commercial banking or investment banking, so we minimize the potential of conflicts of interest that result from being involved in such businesses. That's another key difference.</p><div class="quote">“We set up an office in Panama one year ago to be closer to the local client base."</div><h4>What is the significance of family businesses in Latin America, and what are you doing to attract them as clients?</h4><p>Lombard Odier is a family business, so we strongly relate to family businesses in Panama and Latin America. Among many important organizations is the Family Business Network, which our firm is a member of and which meets once a year with all the national chapters. The organization is all about families exchanging experiences, and providing a platform for them to interact. We have extensive experience in this field, having funded the IMD-Lombard Odier Global Family Business Award since 1996 as well. We also co-wrote books on the subject with John Ward, clinical professor of Family Enterprises at Kellogg School of Management.</p><h4>What strategies are you providing clients in order to help them preserve their wealth?</h4><p>We manage portfolios based first and foremost on our clients' appetite for risk. They have the whole world in which to invest, so we offer them recommendations on cash, bonds, equities, structured products, and commodities so that they can invest in a whole range of products, depending on the macroeconomic environment. We then manage their portfolios with the fundamental conviction that we must first conserve wealth. The families we work with are concerned about passing their wealth to future generations. The safety of our clients' wealth is our primary concern.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the regulatory framework in Panama, especially in comparison with other countries in the region?</h4><p>Panama has an excellent system in place, and strong reflexes, too. They have the right attitude. They are looking in the right direction, and they want to be significant international players in the financial sector. It is an open country, and always has been. Panamanians want to be open and to adapt, and they want to be key players in international finance. They are making good progress in this direction.</p><h4>What are the similarities and differences between Panama and Switzerland from a legal standpoint?</h4><p>The separation of the superintendence of banks and of Marcado de Valores is the main difference. In Switzerland, for example, you have the Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA), which is the overseeing body that covers all financial issues.</p><h4>What are your financial expectations for 2014 for the bank?</h4><p>Though we don't see the market growing as strongly as it did last year, we anticipate single-digit growth. Our business always involves a combination of existing assets and new assets, and the growth of those assets depends largely on our ability to match portfolio management with clients' needs and ambitions.</p><h4>What are the challenges facing the banking sector in Panama?</h4><p>Real estate could be an issue here, as in many markets. There was 29% growth in construction over 2013. Much of the growth was not achieved by Panamanians, but by money invested by foreigners. A lot of the growth depended on factors that Panamanians did not directly control. Depending on, for example, the political situation in Venezuela, those living in Panama might move back there. We hear that the construction sector will slow down in 2015, as well. If there is a slowdown, traditional banks may be exposed to the risks involved.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the ECSSR evolved since its establishment?</h4><p>The ECSSR has undergone many changes since it was established in 1994; we have had 20 years to develop our organization. The most significant changes have occurred in our research department, largely through the development of the new processes we now employ. We began with a handful of people working here, and now we have almost 300 employees ranging from fresh graduates to experts in relevant fields. The ECSSR is very different to how it was when we started, especially in terms of our research methods. In the early years we expected everyone to be familiar with the methodologies; now, we are teaching them, offering three diploma programs for staff in our various departments. Everybody may undertake the diploma, whether they have a degree or not, so everybody has the opportunity for professional development.</p><h4>One of the biggest issues facing education in the region is the emphasis on memorization and not critical thinking. How can education be improved?</h4><p>That is a big question. The right programs need to be put in place today, and only after 20 years will they be successful. It is important that we start today because it will take those 20 years to realize generational change. That is the only way to improve education. The desired outcome of that education will not be achieved overnight; it will require time. Critical thinking is very difficult. Although we have teachers, they are very traditional in their methods. These teachers began in the 1950s, and so reflect traditions built over many years. We want to change this, but it is very difficult. Presently, critical thinking equates to about 30% of teaching. We understand it is very important, but it will grow over time not overnight.</p><div class="quote">“There are future opportunities in industrial and technological production, as well as in energy and trade."</div><h4>What affect is ICT having on society?</h4><p>Technology is crucial in many aspects of national life, particularly education and the military; it is changing the world. Social media is changing everything. We are not dependent on TVs, newspapers, or journals anymore. Through Facebook and Google+ everything has changed. Technology here needs to be improved and people need to be allowed to accept it. There is hope that people under the age of 40 can become technologically educated, but it is more of a challenge for those over 40.</p><h4>Like many other countries, the UAE encourages nationals to enter the private and public workforce. What are the challenges of this policy?</h4><p>It is a good concept, but you are limited because Emiratis make up just 16% of the population. Much of that 16% is needed in the military, the police, the municipalities, and the energy sector. It is a good idea, but it is limited because of the size of the Emirati population. The private sector can be improved by becoming more national; however, it is a very difficult concept to achieve. A private sector firm, whether it is an international or national company, has to answer this question. I think it is a very difficult process for the private sector to become more Emirati than international. The private sector is bound by certain profit expectations, and so how they employ Emiratis can be problematic.</p><h4>Food and water security has become a growing issue in the region. How can the UAE ensure sustainable access to food and water?</h4><p>Food and water security in the UAE is a huge problem. The food problem can be tackled internally. However, water is a regional problem, not just for the GCC but also for the Arab world as a whole. The water shortage is universal and we need a solution to the question of water security. You cannot rely on desalination forever. This is a huge challenge for the UAE, as it is for every Gulf country. The GCC member states must cooperate because they all share the same problem. We have to work on this together to ensure not only water security, but also the security of the region itself. We have to address it together because the issues of security and water supply are of paramount importance to all GCC countries.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>There are big opportunities for oil, gas, and alternative energy. The energy sector is very important for the world, not just for Abu Dhabi. The 2030 goal for economic diversification is vital in improving the quality of life for the people here. They are used to the oil boom. Most of the people living today have not experienced life before oil. They can't go back, because it was a very difficult time. Energy alternatives are needed, and so far the UAE has contributed more to the development of alternative energy than many other countries. We can become a renewable energy hub through cooperation with the US, Germany, South Korea, China, and other countries, as energy is important not just for the UAE.</p><h4>Each year Abu Dhabi hosts the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX). How important is this event on the international calendar?</h4><p>It is becoming increasingly important because the fields of technology and the military are becoming more interconnected. If the military seeks to face change effectively, it must involve the technological factor; it can't just bear arms. The technological factor is very important to the military and must be a focus area. Germany is working to change its constitution, which will give it the opportunity to export military equipment. Technology will change the market for weapons. It used to be just the US, Russia, and China—but now everybody can produce it.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see from the Arab Spring?</h4><p>The Muslim Brotherhood is creating a major disturbance because it is not up to the standard of change. It faces many problems because of what it is preaching—aims that are very difficult to achieve. The Brotherhood wants things to be the same as they were 1,000 years ago—they can't be. People are changing, and I think it is very important to pay attention to this generation. Indeed, people are changing globally, and you have to pay attention to the people. What you learn is modernity. People want change. Whether the change is actually happening is another question, because I think the Muslim Brotherhood is counterproductive. In the Arab world, it is a contest between political Islam and the military. But still, the people want change; even if they remain silent about what has happened. They gave into political Islam because they had no alternative. But this revolution is not limited to the Middle East. It will happen worldwide because this generation wants change and they want it now. I think that change is coming.</p><h4>What opportunities do you see in the UAE?</h4><p>There are future opportunities in industrial and technological production, as well as in energy and trade. If the UAE wants to become an ICT hub, it must produce technology. You can't just consume a product, it's important to produce it and export it too. That will make Abu Dhabi a future hub for technology. It is very important to us.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Following your visit to Mexico in October, you stated the importance of deepening Ireland's business ties with Mexico. What aspects of bilateral relations will both nations focus on?</h4><p>Ireland and Mexico enjoy strong links of history, culture, business, and education. My visit to Mexico focused strongly on the potential to enhance the already excellent links between our countries. Ireland and Mexico share common values and interests in areas of global concern, including combating climate change, promoting disarmament and non-proliferation, encouraging sustainable development, addressing global hunger and under nutrition, and advancing gender equality. President Peña Nieto and I agreed that Mexico and Ireland would work more closely together to advance these key priorities at the UN, OECD, and other global fora. We see enormous potential in the economic relationship between us. Mexico is Ireland's 17th largest global trade partner, and we have seen significant investment by Irish companies in Mexico in a wide variety of sectors. We are pleased that Ireland has a presence in the important and vibrant market of Mexico, but we can do more. During my visit, President Peña Nieto and I agreed that there are significant additional opportunities for trade and investment between Mexico and Ireland. We want to support Irish companies in developing further their partnerships in Mexico and to encourage more companies to explore the Mexican market. Ireland has become a world leader in financial and ICT services, in agribusiness, and in biotech and life sciences. There are enormous opportunities for Mexican and Irish companies to collaborate more in each of these sectors. We also see great potential in deeper cooperation in the educational and academic sphere. I had the pleasure of witnessing five MoUs signed between Irish and Mexican universities and educational institutions during my visit to Mexico. Our universities are cooperating in areas as diverse as water management and conservation, support to small businesses, digital skills, online education, nanotechnology, and historical and literary connections between Ireland and Mexico. We have growing numbers of Mexican students in Ireland and vice versa.</p><h4>Mexico is Ireland's largest market in Latin America with commercial ties reaching $1.24 billion in 2012. What areas of bilateral trade have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Both Ireland and Mexico have young populations. During my visit to Mexico, I spoke of how our young people are beginning their working lives in an economy that is very different than five years ago, let alone 10. The lives of our young people have been shaped by technology in a way unimaginable to previous generations. Sometimes it seems that technology changes so fast that we have barely time to assess the implications of one development before it has been overtaken by another. But this rate of change, while daunting, should be embraced as a vista of opportunity. Our challenge is to ensure that our rising generations are well placed to meet these opportunities. I hope to see the governments and the businesses of Mexico and Ireland working together in meeting these opportunities. During my visit to Mexico, our governments signed a joint declaration highlighting the strong economic cooperation between Ireland and Mexico in areas such as agribusiness, the airline and aircraft leasing sector, pharmaceuticals, and ICT. These are examples of areas in which we already have a strong commercial presence in Mexico but there are many more that can be developed over time, including software, digital and online learning, engineering, and project management services, not to mention the food and drink sector and renewable energy—there are so many possibilities. I would also hope to see further cooperation in the science and technology area. Both Mexico and Ireland have scientists working on groundbreaking technologies that can improve people's day-to-day lives, protect the environment, and promote a more sustainable way of living. I believe that we could achieve a lot together if we harness the energy and innovation of our scientific and technological communities.</p><div class="quote">“Ireland and Mexico enjoy strong links of history, culture, business, and education."</div><h4>What strategies should be taken into account in order to increase this trend?</h4><p>The work of our embassies—both Ireland's Embassy in Mexico and Mexico's Embassy in Ireland—is hugely important in promoting and facilitating increased trade, investment, and educational cooperation between Ireland and Mexico. In addition, our respective state agencies for trade and investment—ProMéxico in the case of Mexico and Enterprise Ireland and the Industrial Development Authority (IDA) in the case of Ireland—have an important role to play in introducing our companies to each other. I am also encouraged to see the dynamism of our companies and universities in proactively reaching out to their Mexican counterparts and creating vibrant, creative, and successful partnerships. Finally, official visits—by presidents, ministers, governors, and mayors—have a crucial role to play in broadening contacts at a senior level in government and business in both countries and encouraging our companies and educational institutions to strengthen their existing links and to find and develop new partnerships. I am pleased that, since my visit in October, we have seen visits to Mexico by the Lord Mayor of Dublin and by Ireland's Minister for Justice and Defense. Ireland looks forward to welcoming Mexico's Minister for Economy, Ildefonso Guajardo, to Dublin at the beginning of May 2014, the first ever official visit by a Mexican Minister for Economy to Ireland.</p><h4>What are Mexico's advantages as a destination for the Irish investment?</h4><p>During my visit to Mexico, I had the honor of being the first serving European Head of State or Government to address the prestigious Cumbre de Negocios in Guadalajara. My key message to the audience there was that Mexico is a valued partner for Ireland, and that Ireland should also be a valued partner of choice for Mexican business. Mexico has significant advantages as a destination for investment by Irish business. It is the 14th largest economy in the world with a population of 112 million, a young and dynamic workforce, and over 44 free trade agreements (FTAs) with partners across the world, including the EU. Some of Ireland's most innovative and successful companies have already invested in Mexico in the agribusiness, paper and packaging, airline, engineering, and pharmaceuticals sectors. Dynamic Irish companies including the Kerry Group, SmurfitKappa, Irelandia, Kentech, Bimeda, H&amp;K, and Randox are contributing to the Mexican economy and are creating high-quality jobs in Mexico. We in Ireland see Mexico as a gateway to the wider Latin American market and want Mexican companies to see Ireland as a gateway to the EU and its market of 500 million people. Ireland also offers a very attractive option for investment. We have one of the most open and progressive economies in the world. Over 1,000 international companies have chosen Ireland as their strategic base in Europe. Eight of the top 10 global ICT firms, nine of the world's top 10 pharmaceutical firms, and all 10 of the largest online companies in the world operate from Ireland. These companies find what they need in Ireland; that is, a talented, educated, and innovative workforce and a clear, transparent, and efficient regulatory environment in a eurozone country. Research, creativity, and innovation are the particular strengths of the Irish. While our Nobel Laureates for literature—Yeats, Shaw, Beckett, and Heaney—are very well known, I am proud to say that Irish creativity and innovation is also evident in contemporary science and technology sectors. We would like to see more Irish businesses in Mexico, and we would like to see more Mexican businesses in Ireland. One exciting initiative in this context is the Mexico Dublin Business Conference that will be hosted by the Lord Mayor of Dublin at the beginning of May 2014. This conference will focus on strengthening links between Irish and Mexican businesses. We are very much looking forward to welcoming Minister Ildefonso Guajardo, who has agreed to give a key note address at the seminar, as well as the head of ProMéxico, Ambassador Francisco Gonzalez, and the Mayor of Guadalajara, Ramiro Hernandez. They will be accompanied by Mexican businesses in a range of sectors and they will have the opportunity to see for themselves all that Ireland has to offer as a destination for investment, trade, and education.</p><h4>Regarding the new regulations, particularly the energy and the financial reform, what is your outlook for the future?</h4><p>During my visit to Mexico I wished President Peña Nieto well in the ambitious reform agenda he is undertaking, in areas including education, energy, finance, and telecommunications. It is vital that all public policy reform is aimed at improving the day-to-day lives of citizens, improving access to quality education, communications infrastructure, efficient financial services for families and small businesses, health and nutrition, and affordable and clean energy. President Peña Nieto has spoken often about the necessity of ensuring that the rights outlined in the Mexican constitution are reflected in the day-to-day reality of the lives of all Mexicans. I wish the government and people of Mexico well in achieving this vital goal and building a peaceful, prosperous, and just society.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess your first months in the position and what do you want to bring to COLCIENCIAS?</h4><p>The institution clearly transformed itself during those months. For example, we carried out an internal restructuring and designed the internal information systems of COLCIENCIAS in addition to refurbishing and modernizing our facilities. It was a tough task, but we enjoy the support of the government and other public institutions. We also ranked among the top-five public institutions in terms of the efficient use of resources in 2013. As part of our restructuring, the three main areas on which we focused our budget last year were education, health, and innovation. We plan to support 1,300 Master's and 1,000 PhD students in 2014. We have granted over 2,700 scholarships during the past three years of this government, which represents around 60% of all scholarships COLCIENCIAS has granted over the past 20 years of our scholarship program. Thanks to the all-time record health budget of Ps65 trillion, we have been able to focus on strengthening existing national infrastructure and institutions. Finally, we have assumed the leading role in innovation, having allocated approximately Ps29 trillion to two projects for the development of innovative initiatives. In fact, one of these was aimed at private companies, for which we had over 1,000 applicants, and the other at higher education and research centers. We will be working together with national institutions and centers to factor ideas into Colombia's future science and technology policy guidelines.</p><h4>What is the profile of students benefiting from COLCIENCIAS support?</h4><p>We support a broad spectrum of students in the belief that research specialists are formed during their school years. As a result, and with the support of the regional governments, we seek to boost the potential of young people nationwide. Therefore, we lend support at various levels; at schools to boost research projects among talented students, and at universities focused on Master's degrees and PhD programs, with students who already plan to develop careers in research. One of our greatest achievements of the past few years has been to keep talented students in Colombia, where before many had opted to pursue research studies abroad.</p><div class="quote">“Colombia has traditionally characterized itself as a quick adaptor of new technologies and the habits attached to them."</div><h4>What were the main challenges faced during the development of science and research?</h4><p>The main one was the lack of financial support from the state to promote and develop related activity. As I said before, we are enjoying record budgets, and yet there have been many obstacles before researchers and scientists. Regardless, over the past 20 years, we have managed to create a strong, growing community of over 13,000 researchers, and I believe that this number will continue to increase.</p><h4>The number of patents in Colombia increased by 28% between 2009 and 2012. What are the main reasons behind such success?</h4><p>I think that increasing economic resources, as well as the rising number of PhD graduates in our country, are among the reasons behind such impressive increases. The more you invest in research the more patents will be created. At the same time, COLCIENCIAS has also been contributing to this rise in patents through several initiatives, such as promoting a better understanding of copyright and the registering process. Additionally, universities have been implementing better incentives for academics to develop and register patents.</p><h4>How relevant are partnerships with universities within the COLCIENCIAS development strategy?</h4><p>COLCIENCIAS has always enjoyed solid ties with international partners; however, in 2013, we saw the need to advance such partnerships and establish a better cooperation framework with the leading universities of several countries. The objective of this strategy was to strengthen our scholarship program and the quality of education we provide to our students. In this context, we recently signed an agreement with Purdue University in the US, an institution boasting a long and profitable relationship with Colombia and Colombian students. The agreement is aimed at PhD students and we committed ourselves to sending 200 such individuals to Purdue University over the next decade. Also, the agreement envisages the opportunities many Colombian researchers will have at this university over the next few years. We have also signed an agreement with the UK's University of Bath, one of the leading universities in the field of engineering. Shortly we plan to sign agreements with other institutions such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, as our goal is to strengthen ties with universities from among the global Top 100 list.</p><h4>In which regions of the country does COLCIENCIAS want to prioritize the development of science and technology?</h4><p>Since our current programs and plans form part of a nationwide strategy that aims to promote the best and most promising ideas, it is logical to concentrate on the main urban areas of the country. Nevertheless, we aim to develop egalitarian policies in order to boost innovation, science, and research in all regions so that we leave no one behind.</p><h4>What areas within the technology sector, in your opinion, have the greatest development potential?</h4><p>Colombia has traditionally characterized itself as a quick adaptor of new technologies and the habits attached to them. Thanks to the national emphasis on innovation, we will see great developments in new products and services, as well as the process of integrating technologies within business practices to render them more efficient.</p><h4>How important is collaboration among the public, private, and secondary education sectors in boosting science and technology?</h4><p>I believe that the willingness to collaborate already exists; however, we need to work further on allocating resources in the private sector, the engine of any economy. At the same time, I think we lack the capacity for communication between all parties due to a mutual lack of knowledge. Antioquia is one of the best examples of solid collaboration between all parties, and other regions will follow this example in the near future.</p><h4>What is your overall outlook for science and technology sectors?</h4><p>National defense expenditure is currently high, but should we succeed in reaching a lasting peace certain sectors are bound to benefit from reduced military spending and a rechanneling of resources. Entities active in the science and technology arena enjoy greater opportunities, and as we achieve greater security, investment in other sectors will grow. This will encourage researchers to pursue their careers in Colombia rather than relocating abroad. I also think that many Colombians will be willing to return to their homeland, and indeed, the government is set to launch an ambitious program to attract people back. Other Latin American researchers will one day find that Colombia is an ideal place to work; it has all it takes to become a regional science and research hub.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What did 2013 mean for Azercosmos and Azerbaijan's space program in general?</h4><p>As the government of Azerbaijan attaches great importance to the development of ICT, this sector of the economy has gained considerable influence in socio-economic life in recent years. Therefore, it is not surprising that His Excellency President Ilham Aliyev declared 2013 as the “Year of ICT." In 2013, we were able to launch Azerbaijan's first ever satellite, which constitutes an important accomplishment not only for Azercosmos, but for the country as a whole. This was one of the strategic projects carried out by the government as part of a wider plan of economic diversification and development of the non-oil economy. Azerspace-1 undoubtedly represents an investment in our future and it will be a source of pride for the whole nation for many years to come.</p><h4>What was the cost of the Azerspace-1 project?</h4><p>The total cost of the project, along with insurance, was around $230 million. However, 85% of this project was financed by foreign banks, such as Ex-Im Bank of the US and France's Coface. The fact that these banks were willing to fund the project proves that it looked promising and profitable from the very beginning. The government only funded 15% of its cost. It is noteworthy that Azercosmos was able to secure a highly competitive premium insurance rate for the launch plus one-year cover. This was the lowest rate in the satellite insurance market since 1999. The reason Azercosmos was able to obtain a very competitive premium rate for the insurance, despite being the first satellite operator of its kind in Azerbaijan and the whole Caucasus region, is attributable to a number of factors. Firstly, its close partnership with highly credible companies in manufacturing and the launching of its satellite gave the insurers confidence in the hardware being used. Secondly, various relationship-building measures were implemented with key satellite insurers and senior members of the Azercosmos management, allowing the insurers to better understand the business of Azercosmos, thus increasing their desire to support the program. Finally, with the assistance of its international partners in its short lifetime since its incorporation in 2010, Azercosmos was able to overcome a number of technical, commercial, and managerial challenges that ensure Azercosmos has robust insurance cover provided by a small group of the most financially sound and secure insurance capacity providers in the world.</p><div class="quote">“Our priorities are commercially driven and are an example of how we can assure the sustainability of our national economy."</div><h4>How have the financial returns been since the launch of the satellite?</h4><p>The international satellite services market is highly competitive due to the large number of well-established global and regional players, but we are not afraid of competition as we have a well-developed business strategy and we know where we want to be at least 10 years from now. Once you develop the right techniques, models, and strategies, there is a major chance that you will be successful. As we were developing our business model, instead of spending our valuable time on market research we decided to talk to our perspective costumers, listen to their feedback, and ultimately reshape our ideas and products to fit what they actually wanted. And today, we can certainly say that the launch of Azerspace-1 was a great commercial success for us. In the first six months after the launch, we were able to generate $10 million in revenues, which is astonishing—even for established satellite operators.</p><h4>What markets can the satellite service target?</h4><p>Azerspace-1 has a hybrid payload including both C-band and Ku-band antennas. With the Ku-band antenna, we cover the markets in Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, the European part of Russia, and, of course, the Caucasus. With the C-band, which has 24 transponders, we cover one of the most promising markets in the world, Africa. One thing I would like to point out is that the C-band transponders are switchable, so we can divert the focus of attention to fully cover, for example, Europe or Central Asia easily. Our main goal with the satellite has always been to cover an extensive market that has a bilingual heritage, such as Central Asia, and offer them much required TV services. We offer both Russian and Turkish language TV channels there. When it comes to the Middle East market, we try to accommodate their needs in terms of both Arabic and English language channels. We plan to take important steps in the next two to three years, especially in Africa, where we are working hard to build up our customer base.</p><h4>What strategies are being employed to develop Azerbaijan's space program in the future?</h4><p>For the years to come, Azercosmos has two projects to foster Azerbaijan's space program. The first is to launch the communication satellite Azerspace-2 in near future. We have recently been awarded an important grant by the US Trade and Development Agency, and we are attracting world-class consultancy services for feasibility studies on Azerspace-2. All in all, we plan to launch the second telecommunications satellite by the end of 2017. Secondly, Azercosmos supports the national development goals by implementing a strong and up-to-date national geo-information system infrastructure designed to meet the needs of the country, and the region as well. For this purpose, Azercosmos is implementing a plan to acquire an Earth observation and remote-sensing satellite system. The satellite-based Earth observation system will be an enabler to achieve many core objectives, such as the production of imagery data useful for the national GIS infrastructure, the support of agricultural activities, environmental monitoring, ecological and natural resources research, and support for disaster and emergency management activities.</p><h4>How is Azercosmos looking to upgrade its workforce to meet its future expansion plans?</h4><p>A large part of our success can be attributed to our people and their capacity and skills. It all goes back to the moment when we started recruiting people; apart from the technical skills, our priorities were professionalism, devotion, and the willingness to push boundaries and work within a team. After identifying our priorities, we started searching for the right people to join us through a variety of channels. In this regard, we provid opportunities for people to reach the top positions. When we started there were less than a dozen people, and now there are over 100. We are still in the search of people for two upcoming projects, and we also want to strengthen our collaboration with local universities.</p><h4>How would you assess Azerbaijan's developments in the space industry compared to its regional counterparts?</h4><p>Compared to other countries in this region and newcomers, Azerbaijan's space project was not dictated by a national imperative or political aspiration. Our priorities are commercially driven and are an example of how we can assure the sustainability of our national economy for the future and identify potential investment areas to meet the real potential of our country. That's why it has been successful so far, and for us it is a question of economic wealth. On the other hand, with a population of over 9 million and a terrain of mountains and plateaus, Azerbaijan has its own specific challenges in bringing connectivity to its people, especially to those residing in remote and hard-to-reach mountainous areas. Satellite networks can be rolled out quickly and inexpensively to hundreds or thousands of locations, connecting cities or remote locations across a large landmass, where the cost of fiber is prohibitive. It will also eliminate the dependence of the country on other satellite networks and will provide the population with high-quality TV and radio broadcasting.</p><h4>What are the main events that will impact Azercosmos' activities in 2014?</h4><p>In the first half of the year, we announced a tender and hopefully will sign a contract for the manufacturing of a remote sensing satellite. We plan to increase our presence in the Middle East and Central Asia markets, and also in Turkey and the CIS region. By mid-2014, we should have a better idea of where our next communications satellite will be placed. Additionally, there are other projects that we will push and that will see Azercosmos grow organically.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In recent years, Emirates Steel has committed AED10 billion to a two-phase expansion plan. How has this investment transformed the company?</h4><p>On September 26, 2012, we inaugurated the completion of our AED6 billion ($1.6 billion) Phase II expansion program. This Phase increased our total production capacity to 3.5 million metric tons per annum (MTPA). We launched our two-phased expansion program in June 2006, completing Phase I in June 2009 at a cost of AED4 billion ($1.1 billion). This has more than doubled our production capacity and made our company the largest integrated steel plant in the UAE, capable of manufacturing raw steel from iron oxide pellets. Our expansion has both directly and indirectly created over 2,000 jobs in the country; in parallel, many high-profile technical job opportunities have opened up for our UAE nationals. Today, we are the leading producer of rebar, and we are recognized as one of the foremost wire rod producers in the GCC. Besides our finished rebar and wire rod, we also have the capacity to produce and sell direct reduced iron and steel billets as semi-finished products. More significantly, we are now the sole producer of structural steel in the MENA region.</p><h4>What is your current production capacity, and what is your current output in MTPA terms?</h4><p>In 2012, we began producing at a capacity of approximately 3.5 million MTPA, following two expansions and the investment of AED10 billion ($2.72 billion). Annually, we produce around 2.1 million tons of 150 mm x 150 mm billets, around 1.9 million tons of 8 mm-40 mm rebar and around 560,000 tons of 5.5 mm-16 mm wire rod. As of the beginning of 2012, we began producing around 1 million tons of structural sections from approximately 200 to 1,016 millimeters in depth.</p><div class="quote">“We are the leading producer of rebar, and we are recognized as one of the foremost wire rod producers in the GCC."</div><h4>To what countries are you currently exporting?</h4><p>Our domestic market share increased in 2012 to approximately 60%. This has been achieved through targeted efforts to support key customers and by pursuing sales policies that assist in bringing stability to the local market. Apart from focusing on domestic markets, where we sell nearly 70% of our products, we have exerted sustained efforts in increasing rebar and wire rod exports to regional markets, with a year-on-year increase of 67%, our most significant export markets being the GCC states, followed by Southeast Asia, India, Pakistan, and Iraq, where we sell the remaining 30%. We have the capability to produce and sell a wide range of heavy and jumbo structural sections from 0.2 meters to 1 meter in depth. We anticipate that GCC demand for sections is currently around 1 million MTPA. This market is further expected to grow at 3%-5% per year for the coming decade. A significant proportion of our structural sections will be sold in the GCC market, while the remainder will be exported beyond the region to Arab countries, Europe, America, Australasia, the Indian subcontinent, and Asia.</p><h4>How does Emirates Steel support Abu Dhabi's Economic Vision 2030?</h4><p>The meteoric rise of the company has always been in line with the Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030, which maps out the government's long-term plans for the diversification and development of the Emirate's economy. Each step has been made to ensure that we grow in parallel to the sustainable economy of Abu Dhabi, making provisions for global competitors within the Emirate's borders. As such, our ambitions run far and wide to become the leader in our area of expertise and in turn reduce reliance on imports. The main goal behind Emirates Steel being established was to serve the downstream sector, especially the smaller industries coming from the steel sector. Of course, we want to help create jobs for UAE nationals, which is one of the core areas the Abu Dhabi government has chosen to focus on.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you evolved since the creation of Sagicor Panama and what has been your growth strategy?</h4><p>I joined Sagicor in October of 2011 with the purpose of re-launching the company in Panama. The company entered the market in 1999 buying a small health portfolio and attempted to grow organically. However, there was not a clear strategy back then, and the main purpose of entering the market was because of Panama's strategic geographical position, which could be used as a hub for future opportunities within the region. Today, we are working on an aggressive branding campaign. We have launched new products and our strategy is to continue to grow organically while also seeking M&amp;A opportunities, though only for the right price and if they make sense. We are also taking advantage of some aspects of the new insurance law of 2012, which enables insurance companies to distribute their products through alternative distribution channels. This means that an insurer can use, for example, a pharmacy or a bank to distribute products tailored to their captive customers. In addition, the new law also allows insurance companies to develop their own sales forces of exclusive agents. Previously, independent agents often had no loyalty to one company. Now, companies can bring in people for training and development, and once they become agents they will be exclusive to one company. That gives the company greater opportunities to build up both brand and sales. We offer all familiar types of coverage such as the traditional individual health policy, the group health policy, and individual life policy. And then we have products that no one else has, such as the Triple Protector and Maximum Protector, critical illness products that cover you in the event of the diagnosis of critical disease such as cancer, heart attack, or stroke. Sagicor is also bringing some unique products with the purpose of strengthening its relations with brokers, such as a new individual health policy with international benefits and the only disability income individual policy available on the market.</p><h4>In which sectors of the economy are your services most required?</h4><p>The products we currently offer are mainly tailored toward the middle to high end of the market. Life insurance and individual health insurance have traditionally been products that the middle to upper markets buy. However, with the rise of micro insurance as a concept, there are a range of new opportunities cropping up in the middle to low end of the market, but they can be challenging as they require strong premium collection platforms. We believe there are a lot of opportunities within the micro insurance sector for the low end of the market, but first you need to identify high volumes and be able to implement proper conservation and collection strategies.</p><h4>How did your portfolio evolve over the past few years at Sagicor Panama?</h4><p>We have been growing at a rate of around 15% to 20% per annum. Our portfolio is quite small in Panama, with approximately $4 million in written premiums. Growth in the personal lines of insurance tends to be much more conservative than what is experienced in general insurance. We are currently working on quality of business and healthy organic growth, while strengthening relationships with key target brokers and closing some strategic alliances for alternative distribution as well. Sagicor today is the strongest insurance group in the Caribbean region, with a presence in the US and a clear vision to continue its expansion toward emerging markets in Latin America.</p><h4>What are Sagicor's financial expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We expect to continue improving our results in Panama by taking advantage of the country's continued GDP growth, expected to be between 7.5% and 8% in 2014. Panama is benefiting also from FDI and from a government strategy to provide incentives to those multinational companies that install their operations in Panama. Panama and Costa Rica are priorities for Sagicor, which plans to use these markets to penetrate further into South and Central America. Panama's low inflation rates and high economic growth, along with macroeconomic events related to the Panama Canal expansion and the country's financial sector, are all attractive characteristics of the country, which should continue providing growth opportunities within the insurance sector.</p><h4>In your opinion, how do people here perceive the insurance sector?</h4><p>Life and health go hand-in-hand with the education level of the people. In addition, if you do not have a strong network of brokers or specialized trained agents, people tend not to be as conscious of personal insurance. Individual life is definitely the hardest product to sell, and one of the strategic reasons behind Sagicor's continued presence here is that life is its main line of business. Panama's population still lacks a high level of education generally speaking. This factor, in addition to the lack of strong sales forces properly trained and specialized in life insurance, has contributed to a relatively low penetration rate in individual life. This low penetration rate, accompanied by the strong economic growth that the country is experiencing, provides great opportunities for companies that are specialized in life insurance. If you compare the penetration rate of life insurance in Panama with that of developed economies such as Chile or the US, it far exceeds that of Panama. People are actually unprotected at the family level, and one of the initiatives that we are pursuing is the development of an exclusive, well-trained sales force of agents to conduct needs analysis door-to-door and stress the importance of life insurance. This must then be backed up with educational campaigns. Life insurance is not a cheap product, but you can sell it based on the real income of each family. Panamanian incomes have been rising; and thus, life insurance in Panama should do much better going forward.</p><div class="quote">“We are first trying to build the organization organically and possibly arrange mergers or acquisitions."</div><h4>Which sector has the most potential for growth?</h4><p>I would say that the one with the most potential for growth is the middle market. Most higher income individuals are already aware of insurance because of their education. Some already have policies from US companies. But the middle-class market promises the most because it is less served and most remain underinsured. Most people within this segment tend to only have mortgage-related life insurance, but remain unprotected on the family side.</p><h4>What challenges will the insurance sector face in 2014?</h4><p>In Panama it will be a matter of competition, as the market is simply too fragmented with 33 players. The margins have slipped and some lines of business are actually losing money. The automobile industry lost heavily in 2013, for example. Other property and casuality lines, such as fire, have not been profitable. There are tight margins on the technical aspects of the business. In health, everyone is competing on pricing and the claims are currently above desired ratios. This is putting pressure on the industry and may have an impact on the cost of insurance. Health businesses are also impacted by inflation. If medical expenses rise, then your health coverage premiums too need to increase. On the life side of the business, it largely depends on the interest rates and US policy going forward. Individual life insurance was a business that traditionally took most of its profits from investments of reserves. Today, it is very important not only to optimize investments but also to seek proper technical results.</p><h4>What is your forecast for the Panamanian economy for 2014?</h4><p>Panama will continue to grow. Perhaps not at 10% or 11%, but it will maintain a healthy level of growth nonetheless, expected at least in the range of 7.5%-8%. Meanwhile, I do not foresee any major political risks in the short term, and should the government be re-elected, it should continue to pursue business-friendly policies.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive destination for foreign investors?</h4><p>Mozambique has been, and will continue to be, a privileged investment destination, as international investors move to Africa in pursuit of fresher and more competitive markets for sources of raw materials. The country also offers viable locations for the processing of those resources in addition to the advantage that some African countries, including Mozambique, have in terms of labor, cost factors, social stability, and access to preferential markets, such as the EU, the US, the Southern African Development Community (SADC), and China. Over the past 15 years, Mozambique has received investments to the tune of between $3 billion and $5 billion per annum from all around the world in various sectors, notably natural resources, agriculture and agro-industry, transport, communications, tourism and hospitality, industry, banking, and insurance, to name a few. It does not come as a surprise to anyone that our business environment has been registering remarkable improvements thanks to a wave of reforms undertaken by the government in close collaboration with the private sector. For over 20 years, the government has been working with representatives of the private sector in the identification of bottlenecks to business development. Reforms in the public sector have also been undertaken allowing public institutions to render faster and more efficient services. These reforms have encompassed various institutions, such as customs services, notaries and conservatories, ministries, and provincial and district government authorities, among others. Legal instruments have also been reformed, including labor laws, the legal framework on investments, and the commercial code. Also, at the heart of the matter is the need to improve the articulation between all institutions directly involved in investment promotion and facilitation which, in the past, used to work in isolation. There is an urgent need to bring them to work more closely together. I am talking of institutions such as the CPI, GAZEDA, CEPAGRI, the ministries of agriculture, finance, mineral resources, IPEME, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the National Tourism Authority (INATUR), the Zambeze Development Office, and the Institute for the Promotion of Exports (IPEX).</p><h4>What is the significance of Mozambique's mid-2013 foreign currency credit rating upgrade by Fitch?</h4><p>We are delighted to know that our excellent development efforts and macroeconomic management are starting to be recognized by the international community, particularly by credit rating institutions such as Fitch and others. It is also very positive when Fitch recognizes, for example, that the expansion of Mozambique's coal sector has been gaining momentum, as well as the improvement of infrastructure. Therefore, Fitch's upgrade of the national economy is significant in the sense that it will be boost international investor and development partner confidence in Mozambique.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique is a stable country and the Mozambican people have proven capable of seeing beyond their differences."</div><h4>To what extent should international investors be concerned about stability in Mozambique given the current events regarding Renamo?</h4><p>Mozambique is a stable country and the Mozambican people have proven capable of seeing beyond their differences. We proved this in 1992 when the government and Renamo signed the Rome Peace Agreement, ending 16 years of armed conflict. We have had multi-party general elections and municipal elections, which are open for all forces of society to contribute to the way the country is run. HE Armando Guebuza, the President of the Republic, has been one of the key guarantors of this openness through a program called “Open and Inclusive Presidency," through which he consults with all our citizens on the way the social and economic development process must be undertaken. It is true to say that certain events lately have marred the positive image that Mozambique has established, but, once again, we will be able to overcome these issues through dialogue.</p><h4>Which are the key sectors for investment in the Mozambican economy going forward?</h4><p>Despite the emergence of mineral resources, agriculture remains a priority sector simply because it is the source of livelihood for most of our population. Given the availability of millions of hectares of arable land (about 35 million hectares), agriculture has the potential to generate substantial revenue through the export of cash crops such as rice, cotton, cashew nuts, and soya beans, among others, as well as covering the food security needs not only for Mozambique, but also for the SADC region. Other priority sectors include the mining sector, with a priority on the local processing of resources, notably coal and gas, agro-industry, general industry, hotels and tourism, banking and insurance, transport and communications, and construction.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Mozambican economy over the coming year?</h4><p>The economy should continue to grow at an average of 7% with the possibility of acceleration with the expected intensification of mining activity. In numerical terms, we expect real growth of 7.8% in 2014; inflation should be in the region of 5.6% and exports should continue to grow and diversify.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4> What is your vision for leading the bank, and what are your core management priorities?</h4><p>While our vision is still to become the world's best Arab bank, our route to achieving this has changed. The premise of the new plan is a simple philosophy of being driven by the customer agenda, or what we call “being core to our chosen customers." In that regard, moving away from a scale-to-scale model is important. Part of the problem with banks globally is that they tend to talk of market share in the same way as industrial firms, when really a bank's share of the revenue wallet is more important. In that statement, you are dealing with clear risk and return criteria. Within that context, our customer profiles may vary; in certain businesses this means retail customers, and in others portfolio customers. In the wholesale banking arena the focus leans much more toward certain industry segments, and subsequently specific customers. Our customer-oriented strategy has three major tenets. The first is to lift NBAD from the number five position in the UAE in commercial and retail banking to number one. In wholesale banking, sometimes called corporate banking—even though the two are different—we are reasonably strong. And in terms of local banks, we are the number one player. And yet, in the retail and commercial bracket, we are massively underweight. Being number five, in my view, is not acceptable if NBAD is to be a strong force in the domestic market.</p><h4>How is the rating significant in the post-2008 world?</h4><p>You may wonder how this little bank in the Middle East, in global terms, is able to compete in this arena. The answer, again, is simple—our rating. If you lack a good rating, no one wants to deal with you. The financial crisis of 2008 changed the world and corporations now decide whether or not they want to deal with you, and not, as formerly, the other way around—they assess you. Our strategy is to bank these selected 800 customers in five general groups. The financial institutions comprising banks, insurance companies, real money funds, and sovereign wealth funds is the predominant one. The second aspect is to bank the energy sector. The third is to bank real estate and family conglomerates, while the fourth is aviation, aviation services and transportation services, not including shipping. The last concerns  traders  and retailers. We have to build up internal competency in that area. My view is that there is significant change in the world that people have not quite come to grip with—namely that we are moving out of a North-South world and into a West-East world, and that the West-East corridor stretches from Western Africa to Eastern China. It removes most of Europe and does not include Central Asia or Eastern Europe. However, the major economic zone traverses Southeast Asia and India to that part of the world, and will be the driving force in the world for at least the next 50 years. Many people are calling this the Asian Century, but I believe it belongs to the West-East corridor. Asia is one of the critical driving factors, is outperforming from every angle, and will continue to do so, bringing along the Middle East and Africa for the ride. In terms of the formation of megacities of more than 10 million people and solid GDP per capita growth, the focus is on that region. Urbanization brings about a middle class, which brings about growth. When you look at the three regions and you look at their strengths, it is easy to identify a strong work ethics, entrepreneurship, and industrialization, as well as surplus liquidity in Asia. It is simply an economic powerhouse, and not just driven by China, India, and Indonesia. In Southeast Asia, we are starting to see the emergence of Vietnam, Myanmar, and the Greater Mekong region. These are countries that have large industrious populations. They are also markets that boast solid policy and know that growth should be driven by private enterprise. Then you have the Middle East, especially the Gulf, with hydrocarbons and investment surpluses. It is beginning to form infrastructure that naturally interlinks, which we see in the ports and airline business and will see more of in the services business. There is potential for the rest of the Middle East to become much more economically independent if it can sort out its political issues. Additionally, Africa, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, has been massively underscored, and boasts huge agricultural, mining, and energy potential. In certain parts of Africa, including West Africa, there is a trend toward urbanization and the emergence of a big middle class. This should probably not surprise the world, but it does. If you consider at economic history over the past 2000 years, for all but 400 years these three continents have dominated economic growth. We are establishing our wholesale network in those five industry groups across that corridor and will bank people from within the corridor and those outside the corridor within it. This includes the likes of Shell, BP, JP Morgan, and probably, much more significantly, the Bank of China, DBS, UOB, Samsung,  Emirates, Etihad, Mubadala, and so on. We will proficiently build flow products. What people don't realize is that lending is the lesser product. Foreign exchange, trade, finance, and cash management are the biggest portions of the revenue wallet. The wholesale banking sector of those segments that we have targeted for activity is worth $140 billion. We are seeing the huge movement of the revenue wallet out of Europe to this corridor, which will be the leading economic zone for the next few years. And we sit in the middle of it. If you look strategically at why the British were so successful, and why Emirates airline and Jebel Ali Port are so successful now, it comes down to physical logistics. Proximity to market and a position in the flow is what you require, and what Abu Dhabi has. This is quite significant and our bank has the potential to capture this opportunity.</p><div class="quote">“I want NBAD to be the best Arab bank in the world."</div><h4>How will NBAD expand abroad?</h4><p>We are looking to build five franchises, in addition to our UAE Gulf franchise, in five countries. Yet, this will take place a little further down the line; we need to get rings one and two in place first. We will look at destination markets of high growth and some volatility, which allows us to capitalize on our rating, high urbanization rate, aggressive GDP per capita, and urban growth. We want to create a business model that acknowledges that we are not going to be the number one bank in any of these countries, as that status is the preserve of a local bank, but one nonetheless that allows us to deploy significant offerings across our retail, commercial, and wholesale banking businesses around specific cities and specific targeted groups. For us, the affluent are important. We don't need 5,000 branches in these destinations to be effective and generate money. We are looking to target specific countries. It could be Egypt, Malaysia, or elsewhere. We are really only starting to formulate these five countries now. Nigeria is also a very attractive market, for example. The mistake that people make is to think that global banking works; it doesn't—not in terms of returns. It is becoming increasingly difficult, too, because of regulatory changes. We therefore have to strategically allocate our resources.</p><h4>Why should UAE depositors contemplate moving to NBAD?</h4><p>One of our value propositions, and I think this has been proven in times of crisis, is a solid rating and safety value. We are now one of the world's 50 safest banks, and the safest bank in the emerging markets. This is clearly something that corporations and individuals want to deal with. We should add to that our customer proposition in terms of improved service and dedication to a relationship, rather than a product-push approach, which is something I emphasize considerably. Customers since 2008 are looking for safety and quality service. We have a lot to do, but I think we are well on the way in terms of relationships. There are few banks that take this, rather than the product approach, and all of them besides us, have major operations in Asia, or are actually from the continent. This insight and knowledge of the customer is something we have to maximize.</p><h4>Where do you want to see NBAD in five years?</h4><p>I want NBAD to be the best Arab bank in the world, having created a strong business offering across the West-East corridor. I also want the bank to adopt a borderless approach in the way it operates, having grown to two-and-a-half times the size it is today, while maintaining balance sheet prudence. Domestically, we want to be number one in the retail and commercial spheres here in the UAE. Lastly, having done those things, we will start to build our five strategic franchises abroad—I think that Egypt and Malaysia will definitely be two of them.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the growth and development of Colombia and its infrastructure?</h4><p>The country is developing at an impressively fast pace, between 3% and 4%, and it was one of the best economic performers in Latin America during the 2008-2009 credit crisis. Therefore, in this context, Colombia has only been in a strong position to invest substantially in infrastructure for a few years. We are very positive about the future development of infrastructure projects here, however, since we observe the availability of funds and liquidity to invest in such projects. Some of the economic highlights of the past couple of years have been the restoration of the risk rating at an international level, at the same level as Brazil today, which encourages foreign investors to Colombia. Also, we have positively increased oil production to unprecedented levels. These two factors, linked to the openness of our economy and its attractive regulatory framework for foreign investors, have contributed to drive economic growth and development in the country. In the past, we had to make tax adjustments by sacrificing investment in infrastructure, a legacy of the previous two governments. This alone encourages us to be very hopeful for the future development of our infrastructure, considering also the fact that we have the support of the private sector and a public budgetary strategy geared towards its development. Additionally, as Colombia has increasingly become a global economic player (by the end of 2013, we will have signed 15 different free trade agreements), the need for infrastructure has risen. Before, infrastructure investment only accounted for 1% of GDP, and studies show that if we want to fully meet the potential growth of the country, we should increase that figure to 3.1% over the next 10 years, spelling an annual investment of between $10 billion and $15 billion over the next decade. The authorities and the nation at large have come to understand that globalization and economic development are part of this challenge, and we are all determined to address this. It is also worth mentioning that the development of the mining and hydrocarbon industries requires further infrastructure to consolidate the boom of recent years and meet the real potential of the country in this sector; we lack the capacity to transport raw materials from the center of the country to the main ports via road and rail. Overall, we have to understand that these huge investments help to drive the economy forward, confirming a determination to execute rapid development. This happened in other countries like Chile and Spain many years ago, and we need to understand that if the infrastructure locomotive moves off strongly, the economic repercussions will not be immediate, but rather be felt over the course of the next two decades. Investments always attract more investors by triggering a snowball effect that can last many years.</p><h4>What is the impact of climate change on Colombia's infrastructure development?</h4><p>Colombia has a unique geography with several climates within a single country. The very severe winter we had a couple of years ago made us realize that we need advances in technology and sophistication when building new infrastructure, especially roads, as we suffer from heavy rains for many months of the year. More complex construction and engineering methods are needed due to the geography and environment of our country and the worsening effects of climate change.</p><div class="quote">“Investments always attract more investors by triggering a snowball effect that can last many years."</div><h4>In your opinion, what are the main challenges ahead for Colombia in developing all the infrastructure projects it needs?</h4><p>First of all, the country needs efficient investment in infrastructure. For example, if we must build roads, let's do it in such a manner that allows transportation vehicles to work efficiently. Furthermore, it is crucial to develop the necessary infrastructure, rather than infrastructure built for political reasons. We have already shared our concerns with the government, and proposed efficiency and competitiveness studies before actually committing resources to infrastructure. Additionally, we think that it is very important to understand the need to ease the acquisition of environmental and community licenses to develop projects, because these are two of the main reasons why many infrastructure projects are not completed. We must understand the unique moment in which we are today, and then push forward with efficient and competitive investment, because if we miss out on this opportunity, we might not be able to invest such large amounts of money in infrastructure in the next 50 years or so. To this end, Congress is debating the new Infrastructure Bill. However, we consider that some points from the Fourth Generation of Concessions Plan, which focuses on road concessions, need to be changed to properly meet the national potential and develop efficient and competitive infrastructure, especially in terms of licenses. We put considerable emphasis on these points, because many of the infrastructure projects will be developed under the public-private partnership (PPP) scheme, whereby the public authorities' funds will cover from 70% to 90% of private investments. However, this public contribution is strictly linked to project completion, and slow licensing is among the main causes of uncompleted projects in Colombia.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SANLUIS Rassini received the GM Supplier of the Year Award in both 2012 and 2013 for its brake division. What is the significance of this recognition?</h4><p>We are very proud to have been awarded the GM Supplier of the Year Award both in 2012 and 2013, as the only Mexican supplier to receive the award two years in a row. The award recognizes our innovative technology, superior quality, outstanding launch support, crisis management, and total enterprise cost solutions. We have been working with GM for the past several years, developing a new technology that helped us win the GM award. Rassini designed a new two-piece rotor for the Corvette that reduced its weight by 18% and offers better heat dissipation than previous designs, making it safer. We have continued to grow our relationship with GM and will soon be on approximately six of every 10 new GM vehicles with either brakes or suspension components. This recognition from GM not only resulted in more business from the automaker, but comes along with major orders from other carmakers. These new contracts have led to the expansion of our foundry in Puebla, as well as the new plant we are opening in the US. All of this is a reflection of a great team effort, reliability, and customer loyalty.</p><h4>What is your outlook for target markets?</h4><p>Rassini continues to drive top and bottom line growth and focus on leveraging opportunities in the US, Mexico, and Brazil. Our consistent focus on technology and engineering development has enabled us to secure new contracts; more than 40 new platforms since 2012. More specifically, North America represents 71% of our sales, so we are very optimistic about this market. The vehicle production projections for 2014 in the region are above 16.8 million units, which is an increase of 8% over 2013. Mexico is increasing its production in a very accelerated way, and we are poised to leverage this growth as our headquarters, production plants, and operations facilities are strategically located throughout Mexico. Research shows that Mexico, which produced 2.9 million vehicles in 2013, will soon be producing 4 million vehicles per year. Mexico is ranked above Canada, Spain, the US, and the UK in automotive exports, while one of every four imported units by the US is assembled in Mexico. The Mexican automotive industry is expanding not only with the American automakers, but also with Japanese and German automakers. For example, Audi is opening its first plant in Puebla in 2014. European trade is also open due to the Mexican Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU, so we can export to the EU without paying duties. That is why Mexico has become a very important center for exports, since we can export to many markets at a lower cost than our competitors. I am very optimistic about what is going on based on realities on the ground, the investments already announced, and the activities that are currently happening. We have come a long way. It shows the competitiveness of Mexico because the Mexican labor force is excellent; the productivity of the labor force here is much more competitive than in China, and the logistics are also superior.</p><div class="quote">“We are very proud to have been awarded the GM Supplier of the Year Award both in 2012 and 2013."</div><h4>What do you have lined up for 2014?</h4><p>Rassini's strategy focuses on leveraging opportunities for growth in our business. We are launching 40 new platforms in 2014, and in 2015 we should have another 20. During 2013 SANLUIS Rassini obtained new business, which will result in revenues of approximately $500 million over the next six years. The company is expanding strongly and we continue to diversify in terms of products and customers. In order to meet the demand of our clients' new platforms, we are expanding our brake foundry and our machine center for rotors in Puebla. It is the largest brake rotor manufacturing facility with an integrated process in North America, and it will continue to expand as Rassini's business grows.</p><h4>What is the performance of the manufacturing plant in Puebla?</h4><p>In a word, excellent! We have increased the efficiency of the equipment over the past few years, especially since 2007. Now we have reached the point where we have to add physical capacity and additional machinery. Currently, 1,300 people are working in Puebla, and we continue to expand in the region. By 2016, we will be the number one supplier of brake rotors in North America. We are currently ranked within the top 100 North American suppliers and are one of the main suppliers to the “Detroit Three." We have a very close relationship with our clients, so we are always looking ahead and being proactive in defining what's coming next.</p><h4>Who are SANLUIS Rassini's main clients?</h4><p>Rassini has an extremely loyal customer base, with 65% of sales amongst the Detroit Three. Some of these relationships span 30 years. Rassini also supplies major European and Japanese automakers with operations in the Americas and in Europe, such as Maserati in Italy. Volkswagen, Nissan, Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, MAN, Scania, Honda, and Volvo, among others, are also customers of ours, which reduces our exposure to competitive weaknesses or financial difficulties at individual OEMs. Our company is also looking to supply heavy-duty suspensions for large trucks and buses for Mercedes-Benz from four plants—two in Mexico and two in the US. This is an expansion of the business we have had with this customer for many years in the Brazilian market, and we pride ourselves on gaining the trust of this client and receiving the first orders for North America. Our goal is to meet evolving customer needs and cultivate strong and long-standing relationships that enable us to be considered an essential and preferred supplier to the automotive industry.</p><h4>What are your growth expectations?</h4><p>Rassini is experiencing impressive growth and expects continued strong financial results in 2014 and ahead, and the increase in sales and productivity will be impressive in the coming years. We are poised to leverage this growth as our production plants and operations facilities are strategically located throughout Mexico, and are expecting to exceed $1 billion in sales next year.</p><h4>Looking at the automotive sector as a whole in the country, what is your role in Mexico?</h4><p>With a headquarters in Mexico City, four technological centers (located through North America and Brazil), and 13 manufacturing plants (two in the US, eight in Mexico, and three in Brazil), we are uniquely positioned to meet the growing automotive demand in Mexico and in the Americas. We are a technological leader in our markets, ranked within the top 100 North American suppliers by Automotive News. The automotive sector is huge in this country. Mexico employs roughly 1.7 million people a year in the sector, and it comprises 4% of Mexico's total GDP. Rassini is a major supplier of suspension and brake units, and as a company we constantly strive to improve our services. We made a new suspension system that is 30% lighter than previous designs and began to develop our own technology from scratch. It used to be that our clients gave us the blueprints, but now it is our own technology that we use, and we continue to work with universities to develop more innovative technology. Rassini has a very close relationship with the University of Ontario, the University of Michigan, and the UNAM, among others, and we are continuously working with the academic centers in the US and Mexico, such as the Tecnológico de Monterrey, which produces excellent engineers. Mexico is producing better people with greater skills every year. We have a proud team, and we also support the families of the workers; we donate computers and train teachers how to use them. We strive to go above and beyond to serve the communities where we operate.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe the role that Visabeira has played in developing Mozambique's economy over the past 22 years?</h4><p>Visabeira has been operating in Mozambique for the past 22 years, with companies active in most sectors of the economy—telecoms, tourism, agriculture, infrastructure, and services. This means that no matter which component of the nation has experienced development, one of our companies has always played an integral part. We are part of a strong network of different partners in Mozambique, and currently have 2,000 employees. We place great emphasis on training our people because, without staff equipped with the proper skill sets, we cannot succeed. This rapidly became apparent when we came to Mozambique. In each country where we are present, we adapt our strategy to reflect real changes. In order to play a role in overall development, it is necessary to pay attention to the market, and to innovate. This is the only way in which to participate in the development of the country.</p><h4>What motivated Visabeira to enter the Mozambican market at a time when there was still not much international interest in the country?</h4><p>When Visabeira started out in Mozambique, we had considerable know-how in terms of telecoms infrastructure. Mozambique was on a development path, and Visabeira identified an opportunity to combine the market with the country's capacities. When Visabeira decided to operate in what was a virgin market, we used our competencies to meet the market's demands of that time, where few other companies were able to do so. Today, many companies are coming here to take advantage of the existing opportunities, but at that time we considered ourselves to be pioneers. Importantly, we believed in the true potential of the market, and identified its opportunities. Our group understood this 22 years ago, and today it is a market that relies on our know-how.</p><div class="quote">“Companies thinking that they can operate here for two years and then leave have no future in Mozambique."</div><h4>To what extent is it necessary to think long term when investing in Mozambique?</h4><p>Mozambique is not a market for hot money. Companies thinking that they can operate here for two years and then leave have no future in Mozambique. It is a growing country, and so it is important for those companies entering the market to commit to it, and to its ongoing development. If you fail to take local realities on board, train local people, get to grips with regulations, or adopt a long-term perspective, you will fail. There have been oil and gas projects ongoing here for between 20 and 40 years. Everybody is aware of Mozambique's oil and gas reserves, but many are unaware that the first cubic foot of gas will actually be extracted in 2019. This perfectly underlines the long-term perspective, based on investments that are being made “now" in order to be able to export that gas in 2019. Billions of dollars are being invested in tomorrow, while current coal exports are at just 20,000 tons today. Such investments require the establishment of a skilled workforce. This is a capital-intensive industry, and cannot keep pace with investment activities without trained local people, as exclusive reliance on expatriate workers is insufficient. I personally came here to stay and improve our capacities. It is even possible for Mozambique to develop operations in Tanzania, Zimbabwe, and Botswana in time, and this is the goal of Visabeira: to be active in each country at a local level, but with a more international perspective.</p><h4>How is Visabeira building local human capital in Mozambique?</h4><p>We build human capital in different ways. One is by bringing expatriates to Mozambique. They can carry out on-the-job training. In addition, we take people from Mozambique and relocate them to Portugal. For example, in the tourism sector, Visabeira hotels in Portugal have many Mozambican people in training. They remain there for one or two years to develop the required skills. Another way in which we build human capital is by paying for technical studies through scholarships. Another means of achieving a solid workforce came about from Visabeira's decision 16 years ago to join an interesting local educational project. We duly became a shareholder in a vocational high school where students are being trained in the field of urban development, computer science, and telecoms engineering. This institution has evolved since then into the prestigious Mozambican organization called Transcom, which is part of the High Institute of Transport and Telecommunications. At mid- and high-school levels combined, we have about 2,500 students in total.</p><h4>How many educational and training projects do you have in Mozambique?</h4><p>I believe that the private sector's most important responsibility is education. However, private companies creating educational institutions must believe in the long-term value of education—it should not be geared exclusively to meeting business needs. In the technical field, higher education is crucial for the development of Mozambique, and requires a clear focus on technical training. There should also be a focus on the humanities, which are important in developing broader-based cultural awareness. But at the end of the day, we have an absolute need for skilled people in technical fields. And as long as an adequate number of institutions providing civil engineering, telecoms, mechanical, and other technical courses exist, we are headed in the right direction. Technical education is an expensive business, but this is the trade off. The important consideration for Visabeira is working with these partners, but with an emphasis on technical education.</p><h4>What are the growth sectors for Visabeira in Mozambique?</h4><p>We have identified a number of key areas that include infrastructure and railways. We perceive a need for substantial investment in the railway system, and will be paying particular attention to infrastructure. We also note significant interest in gas-related investment. We have started to prepare companies to be suppliers for oil and gas operators in the light of this. Everything is connected to oil and gas, although coal also presents an opportunity. This is what we have in mind, and what we are currently working on.</p><h4>What are your goals for Visabeira in Mozambique?</h4><p>Our main goal is to be a qualified company, which means becoming a supplier of services or products at a senior level for the core sectors of the economy, especially in the areas of telecoms and infrastructure. Another target lies in the field of tourism—here, we again want to be a qualified operator, to address the needs of the coming decade. The most important facet of this is to be seen to introduce services that the people can really trust. We are from Mozambique, we are part of the economic reality of the country, and we intend to be a partner of the various operators. Our sole objective is to supply high-quality services to the different fields in which we operate. This is the fundamental consideration.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE insurance market is saturated. What differentiates MetLife from its competitors?</h4><p>There are over 60 companies in the sector, making for pronounced competition for such a small market. Yet given persisting low penetration levels, this still stands out as an emerging market from an insurance standpoint, which in turn means that it has significant potential for continued growth and development. Among those 60 companies, there are some major players of international standing and smaller players that operate in niche segments. Generally speaking, we believe competition is healthy, because it affords the consumer options, and companies need to be on top of their game and offer the kind of service that will prevent customers from opting for the services of rivals. However, there is also something to be said for having strong, well-capitalized companies of a certain size that can continue to innovate. We have been in this market for over 50 years, and we have a long tradition and history here. We have seen this market grow and evolve over the years. We like to think that we've played an important part in that evolution. We have a diversified business, in terms of both products and distribution channels. Those are some of the characteristics that distinguish us from other competitors here in the UAE.</p><h4>There is a new regulation that requires mandatory health insurance for all workers in Dubai. How will this impact your business?</h4><p>The mandatory healthcare reform is a positive development, providing valuable and much-needed coverage for workers here in Dubai. It will be phased in over the next couple of years, but it is hard yet to predict its likely impact on the market and on our own business.</p><div class="quote">“The industry should have well-capitalized and financially strong companies."</div><h4>Which institutions do you work with closely in UAE?</h4><p>We work with various institutions including the UAE Insurance Authority, Dubai Health Authority (DHA), and the Health Authority Abu Dhabi (HAAD) and engage with the regulator to exchange ideas and best practices based on our experiences. We are also major players in the employee benefits field, providing life and medical insurance coverage to many companies here in the UAE. MetLife also works with employers to determine what some of the most important aspects of the decision will be for them.</p><h4>The UAE Insurance Authority is also working on regulations regarding capital adequacy ratios. What effect will this have on the insurance sector in the UAE?</h4><p>The industry should have well-capitalized and financially strong companies. This will help build trust from a consumer perspective, and we think the regulatory authorities' engagement and involvement in this area will be helpful to the industry. We believe that the local market still has room for growth and development. More structured and developed growth is better for business. To make that happen, we need to gradually increase the level of insurance awareness, and part of that is making sure there is trust in the financial standing of the industry as a whole, and in individual companies. This is definitely a step in the right direction.</p><h4>MetLife also signed an agreement with Citi to establish a distribution plan for 2025. What is your plan for the Middle East in 2015 and beyond?</h4><p>We already had an agreement with Citi to distribute credit-linked products, which was a global agreement of widespread coverage. That agreement was due to expire in 2015, so we have agreed to a 10-year extension to this agreement with Citi, as well as a series of enhancements, especially on the product front. As stated in a January press release, MetLife and Citi are pioneering the type of partnership required today to ensure that consumer needs are met in a consistent way, and providing enhanced value, products, and services to our clients. Those elements are all present in this agreement, and we are pleased to be able to work with Citi in this area going forward.</p><h4>How do you get the feedback you need from your customers to be able to provide better products and services?</h4><p>Steve Kandarian, MetLife Chairman, President, and CEO identified a customer-centric focus as the key to achieving a long-term, sustainable competitive advantage. Competitors can copy products and technology, but becoming a truly customer-centric organization takes years to achieve and is difficult to replicate. To achieve this, we have embarked on a major transformation in every aspect of the way we do business starting with the way we design our services and products. Part of the process is listening to what our customers are saying. To do that, we have measures that include what we call a Net Promoter Score, which allows us to survey customers, gaining feedback on how they view our products and services and our engagement with them. We measure that and use it as a baseline, embarking on activities that are intended to improve on that baseline, and then measure again, in a continuing process so as to ensure that we are making progress in different customer touch points. That is one of our major initiatives, not just in the UAE, but also across the world.</p><h4>MetLife Alico is rebranding to become simply MetLife. What is the strategy behind this brand change?</h4><p>One of the ways we run our business is to focus on what we call One MetLife, making sure that there is connectivity across the organization, even in a region as diverse as the Middle East. When MetLife acquired Alico, MetLife understood the value of the Alico brand, and it was important to preserve that value for a period of time at least, which is why we initially branded as MetLife Alico. As MetLife brand awareness has become stronger and more widespread, the aim is to move to a single brand, which is in keeping with the One MetLife approach. This proved highly motivational for our employees and associates, and also helped us to determine how to position ourselves in various markets. We have already moved to the single MetLife brand in many countries across EMEA, and we are getting ready to implement in other markets like the UAE where we currently have the MetLife Alico brand. This will be a central focus for us in 2014.</p><h4>You already have an agreement for takaful in Malaysia. What's your strategy in that regard in the UAE and the Middle East?</h4><p>The Asia region has recently announced a joint venture in Malaysia that covers both conventional insurance and takaful, in partnership with a leading Malaysian bank. For us here in the Middle East, we continue to look at takaful as a potential opportunity. There are regulatory aspects that one has to take into consideration when assessing this business. We had partnerships in the past with certain local takaful providers bringing expertise, and we provided knowledge on the product and a distribution front. We may well continue with this strategy. Takaful is a developed business in Malaysia, whereas it remains a nascent business here in the Middle East, meaning there is the potential for rapid expansion and growth in the segment.</p><h4>What is your outlook on the mainstream insurance sector in 2014?</h4><p>We had a good 2013 with strong growth, including here in the UAE, and we think that will be sustainable going into 2014. There are of course political and economic factors that can have unexpected effects on how business is done in the Middle East, but in a healthy and stable environment, I expect growth in the sector to exceed GDP growth, simply because the industry has been catching up to the ever-growing middle class in the country and the region at large. That tends to reflect how the insurance industry will grow in the future. All things considered, 2014 should bring continued growth in the life insurance sector.</p><h4>Some insurance companies are developing specialized products in anticipation of Expo 2020, in particular for the hospitality sector. What is your strategy for offering new products and services for 2020?</h4><p>First of all, Expo 2020 is a great achievement for Dubai, bringing exceptional growth opportunities, which can only be good news for the insurance sector as well. We tend to develop a wide range of portable and flexible products and services that can cater to specific needs and be distributed across a variety of channels, so we have good experience and know-how that we can bring to bear here. Expo 2020 will open up many opportunities for us, and it's something we can focus on in the coming months and years.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the development of the local economy over the past year?</h4><p>From an entrepreneurial point of view, I think it has been a positive period for the country; the government's main aim has been to do things differently than in the past. For example, it has allowed people to borrow money through Banca Solidaria, a newly established bank, which gives people with fewer economic resources an opportunity to change their lives. I think this tool will boost our country's development, as I believe Dominicans have great talent and creativity, but a lack of economic resources. The government has also taken important steps to boost the national economy in a few strategic sectors, such as agriculture, by providing broader funding opportunities. One good example of that would be the mango industry, which has grown well over the last year.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of the Dominican entrepreneurial spirit in the last few years?</h4><p>I can see that Dominicans are increasingly willing to take part in the growth of the country, and they are realizing the importance of working hand-in-hand with the government for the country's best interest. I can say the same about industrial and entrepreneur associations at the national level. At the same time, I think the government has to become more involved in providing support for their development and the further industrial growth of the Dominican Republic. Lately, we have also seen the establishment of different industrial clusters between Dominican companies that seek to unite efforts and optimize resources and activity in order to become more competitive and efficient, which is a very good sign of development at all levels.</p><div class="quote">“I can see that Dominicans are increasingly willing to take part in the growth of the country."</div><h4>What forms of incentives are needed for the further specialization of the national economy?</h4><p>The government has shown interest in achieving further specialization in certain economic sectors and, so far, the attitude is very positive. However, we are now trying to turn words into action. The cinema industry could be a good example in this regard. At the same time, we have to understand that, because of government mandates, it would take more than four years to see the results of the government's actions, and it can be largely affected by the attitude of the next national government.</p><h4>Do you think there is a long-term vision at the top level for the development of the country?</h4><p>I believe there is a long-term vision, because the government is taking steps that move away from the current mandate. However, I would argue that Dominicans do not see such long-term visions entirely. I understand people feel this way because, even though the government has changed, the final results of the government's actions and decisions have not materialized. Therefore, I would encourage the authorities to take that change further. Only then would society have a different view of politicians.</p><h4>What role does El Nuevo Diario play in bringing the authorities and society closer together?</h4><p>We have always aimed at displaying the government's action, regardless of political persuasion, because we believe that Dominicans must know what their government is doing. In this context, we do not discriminate between good action and bad action by the government; we try to show the reality of our country and government through the pages of El Nuevo Diario. That also applies to international news.</p><h4>What are the logistics and distribution challenges facing El Nuevo Diario?</h4><p>Due to the characteristics of the country, and the fact that not everybody has internet access in the Dominican Republic, El Nuevo Diario cannot reach all the geographic points of the country. Our ideal would be to reach the entire country; however, we have to understand that I have inherited a rather conservative company from my father. I personally have a more entrepreneurial point of view; my challenge is to make our company more commercial and attain national coverage. I aim to reach more and more geographical areas in the Dominican Republic. My duty now is to transmit this vision to all El Nuevo Diario employees because, at the end of the day, they will be the ones making such change possible.</p><h4>Where do you see El Nuevo Diario in the future?</h4><p>I see El Nuevo Diario becoming a nationwide newspaper that will be read by all types of people. Also, I think we must grow our share in the US market, as we have correspondents there. Therefore, we are working toward making the El Nuevo Diario brand better known among Dominicans.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What major investments have you made over the last five years?</h4><p>There has been some $500 million in e-government and ICT infrastructure spending done by the government. At the start of this administration, we developed an all-encompassing digital strategy that focused on two areas; firstly, to improve the level of service to citizens and, secondly, to increase the level of transparency. Those two things tied together were the criteria for selecting and improving the projects to be developed. As a result of this, we launched a program called Panama Sin Papel. It is a paperless initiative and its purpose is to empower citizens to conduct transactions with the government electronically. The program has a number of components. The total cost of the program is around $50 million and it has five pillars. The first component is the identification of the citizens, companies, and foreigners that want to do electronic transactions with the government, because they need to be given a password. We even implemented some innovative systems to facilitate this process. The second pillar is a portal tool, which we call Panama-Tramita. It identifies all the different transactions that you can do with the government. We are using process engineering to ensure that what is there is an efficient process, eliminating those steps deemed unnecessary. That is something that has helped us improve government efficiency and cut the time it takes to process every request. The third component is the interoperability and transaction system, which essentially handles all the forms when you apply for requests. It connects 19 government databases in order to avoid asking citizens to provide information that already exists in the databases of the government. This is an idea that we took from a similar legislation in Spain. The fourth pillar is to implement an electronic payment platform. The final element is the implementation of the electronic signature. Our paperless initiative has been replicated in many other countries in the region, and it has received awards from the Inter-American Development Bank. We have brought the Public Administration forward to the 21st century.</p><h4>Will the voting system be also implemented in the short term?</h4><p>We are very careful when we talk about the Electoral Tribunal, because it is an autonomous and independent entity. It has an excellent team of ICT professionals. We envision that electronic voting systems are the way of the future. We think that it is something that eventually will happen everywhere. We also believe that we have a very strong and solid platform to identify who is dealing with the government. For example, we have designed a kiosk that reads the national identification card and confirms that you are the cardholder by reading your retina or your fingerprints. We can ensure that the person doing the voting is the person authorized to vote. We are buying the latest technology out there. That is why the World Economic Forum ranked us number seven globally for the adoption of high-tech devices.</p><div class="quote">“According to the IDB, we rank third in bandwidth penetration in Latin America."</div><h4>How relevant is this recognition for your agency?</h4><p>Essentially, it says that what the government is doing is going in the right direction. The experts that participate in this evaluation believe that this is something that should be emulated by all governments. On the other hand, it is something that helps improve the competitiveness of our government and of the country in general. We are very proud of all the recognition that our agency has received.</p><h4>In which projects has President Martinelli focused his efforts over his term in office?</h4><p>The President has been very active in all of our undertakings. For example, we needed to have a government-only IP communications system; something that would interconnect all government agencies. We invested less than $10 million; however, the network saves us about $10 million a year in operating costs and charges from telephone operators. President Martinelli was a big supporter of the project and helped make it a reality. A similar thing happened when we proposed to move the government toward cloud computing. There are many small agencies that cannot afford what the new world demands of a modern information-processing center, things like telecommunications consultants and information security managers. Also, in today's world you need to provide service 24/7. You must make sure that the center maintains the right level of service to its users and the citizens. Smaller agencies cannot afford this. Hence, we decided to go to a cloud computer solution. We have three small clouds that are servicing 56 different government agencies. We are also saving significant amounts of money on operations, new investments, and licensing fees. We were one of the first countries in Latin America to adopt a strategy to go the cloud way.</p><h4>What is the importance of the creation of 1,105 free access points for the social and economic development of the country?</h4><p>President Martinelli ran on a campaign to reduce the digital divide. When we discussed this, we saw that the best way to do that was to provide internet access to all that wanted to be connected, particularly those with less resources. There was a law that essentially created a new right for citizens, consisting of internet at affordable prices, but nothing had been done about it. We looked at that as an opportunity for us to make the presidential promise possible. Now we have grown to over 1,100 access points and developed a national Wi-Fi network free of charge. We believe that the significant number of users registered is just a reflection of the acceptance of the program. It also goes hand in hand with the program implemented by the Ministry of Education to give computers to school children. The children go to their schools with their computers, and when they get home they have homework to do. They get connected to the internet through one of our access points. These computers are not only used by the people to whom they were given to but by their immediate family members as well. We have seen instances of computers being used by five different people. That is why we have so many citizens registered in our subscriber base. These programs together have allowed Panama to accelerate the use of digital devices by society in general, bringing it forward to the 21st century. Economically, it has also impacted the way many users are benefited by the network. We are recognized by many technology indexes as the number three or four in computer penetration, internet penetration, and in bandwidth use in Latin America. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) says that we are number three in bandwidth penetration. If we have to pinpoint one thing that has contributed to improving the quality of life for Panamanians, it is the National Internet Network that President Martinelli launched to fulfill a campaign promise to expand the opportunities that citizens have to learn and use the means of this era in their daily lives.</p><h4>How many Panamanians are connected to the National Internet Network?</h4><p>There are 1.3 million in total. We are excited about the significant growth that we have experienced, and we believe it is just a reflection of handing out 183,000 computers in the school system. In 2014, we will provide 116,000 additional computers, meaning that everyone from 7th to 12th grade will have a computer. In addition, primary schools are being given a computer at a ratio of 6:1. That means that for every six students there will be one computer. Also, all 40,000 teachers are being given computers. What we have done has really overhauled the education system. All this has increased exponentially the demand for internet and bandwidth. And, by the way, the internet program is being used for school homework, research, and surfing the internet. It is used to learn and to discover new things.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the level of technology in terms of broadband penetration?</h4><p>According to the IDB, we rank third in bandwidth penetration in Latin America. According to CEPAL, we have the cheapest internet costs in all of Latin America. The Latin Technology Index says that we are second in penetration. The World Economic Forum also points out that we are also second in cellular phone penetration. The combination of all these things points to the fact that the country is moving forward and reducing the digital divide. We are taking advantage of technologies to make Panamanians competitive vis—í —vis their peers around the world. That is very important for us. When you have an economy that is growing at a rate of 10% a year, the first thing that happens is that everybody gets employed. Once everyone is employed, you need to start working on productivity and efficiency. You need to ensure that your manpower is productive. What we aim to do with all the things that we have done is to improve Panama's competitiveness. This is reflected at the World Economic Forum, where we have advanced 19 positions. We occupy the second position in Latin America, and we are very proud of that.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has growth of the gas and coal industries determined your sector focus in recent years?</h4><p>As investment into the mining sector increases the port and transport infrastructure needs to keep pace with our competitors. We have therefore concentrated on the engineering opportunities at the port and petroleum downstream distribution infrastructure. There has been very little investment in this sector since the late 1960s, and in spite of Mozambican ports servicing six landlocked neighbors; we lacked LPG or bitumen terminals and adequate storage infrastructure. The entire Southern SADC Region depends on trucking from South Africa. We have, while upgrading and rehabilitating the Maputo Petroleum Terminal, introduced LPG and Bitumen Terminals, and are in the process of constructing storage facilities in association with Petromoc. We are doing the same in Beira port and propose subsequently to repeat it in Nacala port, too. This will help expand the domestic use of LPG, which is at present only available to around 5% of the population in northern Mozambique, thereby reducing dependence on wood charcoal for domestic cooking and its inherent environmental and health hazards.</p><h4>Do you feel that the commercialization of agriculture has the potential to be a major driver of economic growth?</h4><p>Around 70% of Mozambicans are rural subsistence farmers who do not produce in commercial volume; hence, they do not contribute to the formal economy. The challenge for the government is to educate these farmers, while creating and providing the infrastructure for commercial agriculture. This is so that within the medium term, rural Mozambicans become contributing members of the economy. Commercial agriculture has two important elements, the corporate sponsored large farms and the local entrepreneurial smallholdings. The large farms are important in providing initial investment to create the agricultural infrastructure and to employ the population on a large scale in economically productive activity, thus ensuring equitable growth. Then again, there has to be a balance between food crops, such as grain and beans, and cash crops like rubber, coffee, and oil seeds. Food crops are not commercially viable without government subsidy due to developed countries budgeting for a cheaper food bill for their large urban populations through agricultural subsidy.</p><div class="quote">“Mozambique has a land area twice that of Germany and a coastline of 2,400 kilometers with a population of just 20 million."</div><h4>What are Mozambique Holdings' initiatives in the agricultural sector?</h4><p>We have acquired 10,000 acres of land in Zambezia Province and are introducing rubber cultivation to Mozambique. After due diligence, we developed a nursery with technical assistance from Rubber Board of India to plant 2,000 plants as a pilot program two years ago. Since the progress of these plants is satisfactory, we have expanded the nursery and are planting a further 20,000 in 2014 and have budgeted to plant 1,000 acres over next five years. Since the process requires a large number of workers, we improved village conditions by providing an elementary school and a health center. We also employed all the able bodied villagers, numbering over 600 and created a 200 acre pigeon-pea farm, which is the common local crop that the villagers are skilled with. We will add further workers over time and teach them rubber-planting skills as we progress and introduce one or two more short-term crops, such as turmeric and ginger to balance the cash flows, since rubber is a long gestation crop. Thus, we plan to have an active work force of 3,000 people with a village community of 10,000 people around our farm within the medium term.</p><h4>What makes Mozambique an attractive destination for international investment?</h4><p>Mozambique has a land area twice that of Germany and a coastline of 2,400 kilometers with a population of just 20 million. It has vast arable land with ample water sources and stable ground water, offering vast agriculture and fishing opportunities. Mozambique's mineral and energy potential are well documented, and the country was the largest tourist destination during colonial times. Moreover, Mozambicans have been exposed to foreign cultures due to the country's long coastline. Mozambique is welcoming to overseas initiatives in entrepreneurship and technology. The government has also been actively promoting international investment to develop its resources and employ its people productively so that Mozambique can fulfill its potential and join the ranks of vibrant modern economies.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Invest AD have to offer international investors?</h4><p>Invest AD's mission is to provide global investors with attractive investment opportunities in the Middle East and Africa regions where we have operated successfully for over three decades. We offer equity funds and discretionary accounts with a proven track record of outperformance in recent years, and have also forged strategic, global relationships with partners in Western Europe, Russia, and East Asia. The attraction is high-quality access to some of the world's fastest growing economies, through a partner with wide and long-standing networks across the region. I believe that we are genuinely playing a part, however modest today, in the formation of new patterns of capital flow that will shape and rebalance the global economy over the coming years.</p><h4>Why does Invest AD have such a specific focus?</h4><p>This is because of its increased international profile, especially over the past decade, where Abu Dhabi has emerged as a key gateway to the Middle East and Africa regions. Intra-regional trade and investment have been growing steadily, and I can see from the official delegations that visit Abu Dhabi and the global reach of the Emirate's institutions, that international linkages are only going to grow further. Invest AD has a specific role to play in supporting global partners who also see the high potential of the region. A couple of years ago, we commissioned the Economist Intelligence Unit to survey the world's major institutional investors on their attitudes to investing in Africa, and the message was clear; almost all intended to significantly increase allocations to the continent over the subsequent five years. The main motivation for interest was the region's rising middle class and personal income; quite a shift for a continent that had previously attracted interest merely as a source of commodities.</p><div class="quote">“Invest AD's mission is to provide global investors with attractive investment opportunities."</div><h4>What are your connections in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China, and how do you engage with those parts of the world?</h4><p>We have been developing relationships with institutions in East Asia for a number of years. I believe it is a natural development for investment flows between the regions to rise significantly now, given that trade has already flourished. Currently, we manage private institutional money from Japan and also have partners in China. We also have a strategic agreement with the Korea Development Bank.</p><h4>What challenges do Invest AD's Africa-related plans face in terms of geography, language, and time zone, and how are you working to overcome them?</h4><p>We have plans to establish a presence in Morocco and are among the very few entities to have received a license from the Casablanca Finance City. This is a particularly interesting proposition as, in investment terms, much of the greater Northwest Africa region is uncharted territory and, by providing a gateway, Casablanca Finance City can help investors to participate in Africa's exciting transformation. It also seeks to establish itself as the window to investment opportunities in West Africa as a financial hub. The region is home to 520 million people, and its economy is developing rapidly thanks to intra-regional investment and trade flows, as well as through greater integration into the global economy.</p><h4>What is your policy toward developing human capital at Invest AD?</h4><p>When considering the factors involved in production, the human factor emerges as the most important. Your legacy is measured by what you have done to advance your people. In the UAE, we are blessed with leadership that has made its citizens the top priority. At Invest AD, we are committed to training our employees, but even more importantly, to making sure that they benefit from our everyday operational exposure to international finance. All new hires at Invest AD receive a thorough induction to its business areas, receiving training in technical skills, business skills, and management to encourage fast progress. Development and potential are regularly monitored so as to identify high-performing individuals who are likely to succeed in senior management roles. We also encourage our employees to interact with the community. We are proud supporters of autistic students at the Abu Dhabi Autism Center, and extend our means to facilitate their inclusion in society to be able to contribute to Abu Dhabi's economy and society.</p><h4>Is this shifting global economic paradigm affecting the operations of Invest AD?</h4><p>The global economy is undergoing a large-scale process of rebalancing, and the implications and impact are obviously going to be felt over many years. Everywhere you look, the world is being redefined. For example, India plans to send a spacecraft to Mars, and is truly competing with the US, Europe, and Russia in the space industry, which could have a knock-on effect on innovation in many fields. Meanwhile, China has not only become the manufacturing base of the world, but is also moving swiftly up the value chain. Here in the UAE, the key objective is to diversify our economy and build a knowledge base. In Africa, we see countries jumping several stages of development in small, but significant ways. For example, in Kenya, people who only a couple of years ago had no access to formal banking, are now receiving salaries and storing money deposits on their mobile phone accounts. Our job is to try to understand the changes and to position our offering through our different funds to clients accordingly. That is why, at Invest AD, we pursue on-the-ground research when exploring investment opportunities. Our portfolio managers are always on the go, especially in Africa, and place strong emphasis on direct contact with the senior management of companies, and policy makers.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[clear-mission]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since its foundation, how has Bancomext helped to promote Mexico's foreign trade network?</h4><p>Bancomext was established in 1937 with the goal of promoting Mexican exports around the world. Among development banks, Bancomext has a very clear mission, which is to assist Mexico in strengthening its position in the global arena. We constantly work to develop exports, but also to finance imports, predominantly of machinery and equipment as Mexico needs to increase its productivity through modernization. We are also helping to see a stronger internationalization of Mexican firms. And we need to see the Mexican content of our exports grow, which today is at a ratio of between 30% and 35%. Our goal as a development bank is to strengthen the growth of the country and boost employment. In 2013, our net growth in loans was around 34%. We basically grew at twice the average of other development banks. Bancomext is very much committed to the government's goal of providing additional financing at lower rates.</p><h4>How are the investment flows between Spain and Mexico developing, and how is Bancomext contributing to this?</h4><p>We have around 16 firms that are either Spanish firms investing in Mexico or Mexican firms investing abroad. Of those 16 firms, around six are related to tourism, another six are related to sustainable energy, and two are from the auto industry. In the tourism sector, Spanish firms have already been present in Mexico for many years. The economic situation has been difficult in Spain over the past five or six years. Not only in Spain, but in Europe as a whole, the possibility for these Spanish companies to grow in the local or regional market is not ideal. Mexico needs further investment in tourism, energy, and the automotive sector, and meanwhile there are large Spanish companies with world-class management, cutting-edge technology, and capacity that are keen to explore new markets. The role of Bancomext has been to help finance them in entering the Mexican market.</p><div class="quote">“As is the case in most economies, SMEs are the greatest provider of employment."</div><h4>How would you assess your work among SMEs, and how important are they for national growth?</h4><p>As is the case in most economies, SMEs are the greatest provider of employment, and play a significant role in GDP generation. At Bancomext we are trying to do two things. On the one hand, we need to continue supporting the major exporters, while on the other we want to see a greater participation of SMEs in global supply chains. For example, the number of SMEs we support grew by 135% over 2013. Last year we increased our agreements and our programs with the private sector from five to 11 banks. What we do is provide them with financing and guarantees, where the latter can represent up to 70%-75% of a loan. What really happens is that these banks are then willing to take on a much higher level of risk. Overall, the SME sector has the most potential for productivity growth. We don't only want to increase the number of firms, we also want to establish a national content target. We really want to participate in an effort that goes well beyond Bancomext's traditional role. This is an initiative that we will be working on with the Ministry of Economy and with ProMéxico. What we saw in 2013 was that it was basically a year of significant reforms, with the main thrust being toward increased productivity, growth, and development. As such, it was a year of politics, of setting the groundwork, while 2014 will be a year of administration.</p><h4>What are your growth expectations for Bancomext over the coming years?</h4><p>The President has set a goal of 15% growth in the development bank sector. Yet our goal will be to achieve growth of no less than 20%. This rate is possible for two basic reasons. One is that we still have very low rates of financial penetration, which confirms growth potential. And the second is that we are involved in high growth sectors, such as automotive, as well as logistics, tourism, and the energy sector. We also anticipate that much of the growth to take place will result from constitutional reforms regarding the energy sector.</p><h4>In 2013 Bancomext opened an office in China to promote Mexican exports. What is the significance of China and the Asian market in general for Bancomext?</h4><p>Last year, with the visit of the Chinese President to Mexico and the signing of numerous agreements, we achieved a specific status in our relationship with China. In the past, we had seen ourselves as competitors more than partners. We have a significant trade deficit with China; we import around $55 billion in goods and export just $6 billion. Yet with this new initiative between the two governments, we have been able to remove certain obstacles to trade. For example, we had previously been unable to export tequila or pork. And on the flip side we now also look forward to welcoming Chinese investment in Mexico. An agreement was also signed between Bancomext and China's Eximbank. There is no doubt that China has been an economic phenomenon, and it is destined to become the largest economy in the world within a few decades, and we need to establish a mutually advantageous relationship.</p><h4>How do you view the dependence of Mexico on the US market in terms of exports?</h4><p>Even though we have been diversifying our export markets, we still export 80% of our goods to the US. However, Mexico has managed to diversify more on the import side, especially from China. And with the US remaining one of the largest markets in the world we need to be more efficient and renew our economic and trade ties. That is why, as we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), we need to analyze our next steps, especially in the energy arena. In the last six years, half of GDP has been accounted for by trade. And even though trade is a very significant part of Mexico's growth story, it should have a much higher contribution. This can only happen if we integrate our SMEs into the global supply chain. We need a higher Mexican content among both local goods and exports.</p><h4>How will financial sector reform affect the banking sector, and what are your expectations?</h4><p>The effects of the reforms will manifest themselves gradually but consistently. What will happen at the end of the day is that the volume of loans in the economy will grow. Today private sector loans account for 26% of GDP; the expectation is to arrive at something close to 50% within the next 10 years. If this occurs, it is estimated that GDP growth will rise by at least half a percentage point. If you add to that what is happening in the energy and telecommunications sectors, as well as in other areas, Mexico will be able to grow by at least 4% or 5% per annum. We are working toward an erosion of all obstacles to lending in Mexico. These are good years for development banks because the reforms entail more flexibility and autonomy. Significant reforms took place over 2013, but President Peña Nieto's administration and the political parties are wise enough to recognize that through participation they were helping to advance their own ideas on how to create a better Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>For the last couple of years, Güneş Sigorta has been experiencing growth of about 12%-13%. What were the main factors behind this expansion?</h4><p>Güneş Sigorta has very strong and diversified distribution channels. We work mostly with private agencies and are present nationwide in every city, large or small. Of course, it's to our advantage that we're a subsidiary of one of the largest banks in Turkey, VakıfBank. Our success basically comes down to managing our channels with good relations and an efficient network.</p><h4>In which sectors of the Turkish economy do you see the most potential for Güneş Sigorta?</h4><p>Every line of business has potential in Turkey because the economy continues to grow and, therefore, the insurance sector grows along with it. Furthermore, the Turkish insurance sector remains under-penetrated, which leaves much room for expansion. There are many large foreign players in Turkey today, all having recognized the country's true potential. This makes for an environment of stiff competition. The motor insurance line is, of course, the main driver, meaning mainly third party motor liability, which, being compulsory, is easy to sell. This said, we're actually decreasing our market share in that area due to the considerable loss it entails. It's simply not a profitable line. Instead, we're increasing our market share in lines such as fire, engineering, marine, bank insurance, and also health. There's a lot of growth potential in those lines, and we've doubled our figures across the board.</p><div class="quote">“Every line of business has potential in Turkey because the economy continues to grow."</div><h4>As the market becomes more competitive, can you elaborate on the advantages Güneş Sigorta has over the newcomers?</h4><p>Our private agency distribution channel is one of our biggest advantages. Also, our bancassurance channel remains underutilized. VakıfBank is one of the largest banks in Turkey, and Güneş Sigorta is one of the biggest insurance companies. In the past, we didn't need to work together too much as our private agency distribution channels were doing fine. Yet today we recognize the advantage of cooperation with VakıfBank to expand our distribution and sales channels. We have integrated more and have many common projects. This has already resulted in 60-point growth in bancassurance, and we still see considerable room for more. VakıfBank has many retail customers, as do we, and so we can—and have—come together, and are now working on the customer relationship management (CRM) process. So by refocusing our main attention to bancassurance lines, we can take advantage of having a wide bank network to work with, thereby maintaining an advantage over newcomers. At the end of the day, all of the insurance companies essentially sell the same products, and mostly at the same prices. What differentiates one over another is the extent and quality of its distribution channel. If you have that and can manage it well, you have the advantage.</p><h4>Can you tell us about the level of foreign interest in Turkey's insurance sector?</h4><p>There's been a huge rise in foreign involvement. Foreign insurance companies today account for 85% of market share, up from just 35% six years ago. As a result, Güneş Sigorta is one of the few domestic insurance companies remaining, along with Anadolu Sigorta and Ak Sigorta, as well as some smaller companies.</p><h4>What's your outlook for the insurance sector?</h4><p>There is room for more domestic companies to emerge, and also for another large local player within the next five years. There are also many mutual companies, which also have considerable potential in this market.</p><h4>What regulatory or legal changes need to be made to further realize this potential?</h4><p>I don't think substantial changes are required. Being candidates for EU membership has already brought our regulatory framework in line with European and international standards. There are new laws regarding insurance, which are in place today. For example, the Treasury now audits the sector, and we have tougher regulations than even the EU. However, there are still some problems in terms of claims management, and with the judicial system, but I believe that we'll shortly have financial courts in place. The new law for that has been approved and is on its way. These financial courts will help out a lot, especially in motor and third-party motor liability cases, which can drag on and on in the current court system. Spain has done this, and we will have a similar system. It is estimated that it will be implemented during 2014. Other than that, there's no need for further regulations.</p><h4>Turkey is the 17th largest economy in the world, and yet in terms of the size of its insurance market it only ranks about 35th or 36th. What does Turkey need to do for its insurance sector to match the size of its economy?</h4><p>I think we're doing our homework well, and the future looks bright, yet existing competition is killing prices, and low prices in turn are killing off the chance of creating and selling new products. New companies often come in and try to attract clients by underselling the more established competition. Customers receive the lowest price when they need it, and so innovation is a struggle. But once these new players in the insurance sector settle in and prices stabilize back to normal, the sector will grow and expand. The usual insurance lines are in motor and health insurance. And yet, there are of course many more risks in life. For example, we're working on insurance policies that cover your children's educational costs. The time is not yet right for this, but it's an innovative new product. There is much potential in life insurance, and not just in pensions. As the economy grows, people will consider new life insurance options, too. Also, there are insurance opportunities in terms of covering the liabilities of lawyers or accountants. I expect growth to come from liabilities, personal liabilities, medical malpractice, and professional liabilities. Once the new financial courts are in place, there will be more liability claims. As things stand today, nobody wants to get bogged down in the legal system. But when the new courts are in place, doctors, for example, will need much more coverage. Right now they have low rates with low premiums, because they don't need it. But with a more efficient legal system in place, liability claims are sure to increase, which means more insurance policies and higher premiums.</p><h4>What are your future expectations for Güneş Sigorta?</h4><p>Last year was both good and bad. We saw solid growth in profitable lines, but we kept more reserves than in previous years, which made for some loss in 2013. With every new regulation we needed to keep new reserves. Our main losses were in third-party motor liability, although these were mostly from 10 years ago, and the reserves for those claims have been paid. Thus, in 2014, we expect business to improve, and to be profitable. By the end of 2014, we will be a different Güneş Sigorta from what we were in 2012. We expect a further 50- or 60-point growth year in 2014. Furthermore, we'll have the strength and potential to compete with newcomers.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>To what do you attribute Terpel's success over the past three years?</h4><p>We have a productive 45-year history of success in the industry. Our major achievements are the result of our ability to be present across Colombia, from La Guajira to Leticia. We are close to the people, and our primary motivation is to serve them, rather than vehicles. We reflect this clearly by sustaining a clean image of spotless service stations. We have also been expanding our coverage; we are leaders in aviation with a 68% market share. We also hold 46% of GMV, which supplies  natural gas for vehicles, as well as 44% in liquid fuels. Meanwhile, we hold a 38% stake in diesel and gasoline for industrial use, and 21% of the lubricants market, the only area where we are not the market leaders. Our operations feature 29 storage plants and over 2,000 gas stations located beyond the cities. We also serve 21 airports in Colombia, and serve four airports in the Dominican Republic. We are present in Panama and Ecuador in the liquids market, and in Peru and Mexico in the natural gas market. Meanwhile, we have sold our operations in Chile.</p><h4>What are the basic objectives of the Terpel Foundation?</h4><p>We are committed to being in alliance not just with the government, but also with the country. Everything we do must have social significance, and sustainability is our watchword. The foundations of life are crucial because we believe that education can bring about meaningful change for the country. For the future we need an educated population aware of how to manage Colombia's natural resources. And if we fail to ensure this, we will always be a dependent country. The foundation strives to help children to become leaders and change their environment. As friends of the country we also work on matters such as establishing domestic peace by working on every program we can to enhance the reintegration of people on the fringes of society.</p><div class="quote">“Everything we do must have social significance, and sustainability is our watchword."</div><h4>How are you working on reintegrating former combatants?</h4><p>We think peace will only be sustainable if we can integrate all such people into society. The National Reintegration Agency is doing a great job, although many people are opposed to the idea owing to the perceived risks. We have a positive experience of helping reintegrated individuals. This is the only way to find reconciliation with this part of the society, and the only way to ensure a peaceful future. Terpel believes in the reconciliation process.</p><h4>You mentioned that Terpel has sold its operations in Chile for $240 million. What was the strategy behind this move and what is your investment plan for the future?</h4><p>It was not really a strategic move. When the biggest group of shareholders bought the shares in Colombia, they also had a major share in Chilean operations. It was decided that they could not have a large share by acquisition, whereby they were given two years to sell the company. It was more a legal issue than a strategic one.  We sold it and used that income to pay off some of our debts, creating a larger investment opportunity in Colombia. In fact, our growth plans mainly target Colombia, for which we have two strategies. The first is to continue with the initiatives outlined before, and the second is to increase our station numbers in strategic locations where we have no affiliates.</p><h4>Can you briefly explain who your shareholders are and give us an overview of your financial results for 2013?</h4><p>Our main shareholders are made up of the third largest company in Chile, Empresas Copec, which has more than a 60% local market share. It is a very strong force with service stations and convenience stores, and shared with us its expertise in service provision, as it is perceived as being the best service providers in Chile. We are trying to adapt this for the Colombian market. The remaining companies are Colombian from many regions of the country. This process started in 1991, when many Colombians bought shares in Eco Petrol.</p><h4>You have been involved in the aviation market since 1972, when you started to distribute fuel to the industry. What is the importance of aviation to Terpel today?</h4><p>The aviation market remains crucial for Terpel, and we have an established pedigree in providing jet fuel. Our greatest asset is our network, the largest in the country, and which underpins our leading position in the market.</p><h4>In which ways is your network linked?</h4><p>We have credit card payment options and also something that no one else offers, namely Clubgazel, which is a point system integrated into our network.</p><h4>How many jobs have you created in Colombia and how do you invest in your people?</h4><p>In terms of job creation, Terpel is formed by 2,000 stations (90% owned by third parties), each of which employs about seven people, making a total of over 14,000 people. We also have 1,500 staff at at our head office. Importantly, we employ people in different regions and are therefore committed not only to the country overall, but to each region specifically. What we do for people is pay competitively, while at the same time creating what we consider to be quality jobs. People tend not to leave our company, which is reflected in our low turnover rates. We offer scholarships that allow some people to pursue postgraduate or intermediate studies. We also offer employees a day every month when they arrive early in the morning and leave after lunch in order to have more time with their families, among other initiatives.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is CBRE's strategy for 2014?</h4><p>It should be an interesting year, as we have been enjoying a pronounced recovery in certain Middle Eastern markets. We are aiming to expand our existing team and add new service lines, and we are actively looking at new locations from which to operate during the rest of the year.</p><h4>In which markets have you witnessed a recovery, and which markets and service lines do you plan to expand?</h4><p>The most active location is Dubai, where we see significant recovery in terms of rental and capital values and the arrival of investors, particularly from the Far East. Whilst the level of corporate real estate activity is not quite at 2007 levels, 2013 was nonetheless a very strong year. I expect this level to be surpassed in 2014.</p><div class="quote">“The construction sector is likely to enjoy a prosperous period over the next few years."</div><h4>What have you learned from the crisis of 2008?</h4><p>There are two important lessons to be learnt from the difficulties suffered from 2008; that Dubai's property market is cyclical and subject to the fundamental forces of supply and demand and that Dubai's real estate market is not unique and has been affected in similar ways to many other global markets. Although painful at the time, the experiences will help the development and investor markets in the UAE mature. The experiences have also led the government to introduce various forms of legislation to protect investors and control some components of speculation, which became excessive by 2007.</p><h4>What is your approach to Emiratization?</h4><p>Emiratization is an important priority of the government. All our vacancies at all times are open to all nationalities, and CBRE Middle East currently employs peoples from 22 different countries. We also have a scheme, whereby four Emirati graduates have been seconded for training to CBRE offices around the world including London, Boston, Singapore, and Hong Kong. As the commercial real estate markets rebound, the recruitment of qualified professionals in all our offices is an important driver for growth.</p><h4>You have mentioned that some corporates are coming here from Africa. What are the main advantages to having them in Dubai?</h4><p>The UAE, and in particular Dubai, has particular advantages for businesses operating over a large geographical area. The capacity and reach of the aviation sector here has created a natural hub for businesses operating across Middle East and Africa and the quality of life that the UAE can offer is becoming increasingly attractive as a recruitment advantage for corporate businesses. We therefore see some of our corporate clients who have traditionally operated on the continent of Africa relocating headquarter businesses, so as to benefit from these advantages.</p><h4>Construction is expected to have grown by 9% from 2013 to 2014. What is your forecast for Dubai's real estate sector?</h4><p>The construction sector is likely to enjoy a prosperous period over the next few years, with strong investment in real estate and infrastructural projects from both the private and public sectors. Abu Dhabi and Dubai both have ambitious infrastructural expansion plans proposed and strong business sentiment is stimulating new demand for commercial and residential real estate. Additional events like the World Expo and FIFA World Cup, the general growth in population and tourism, and the construction of real estate sectors are the ingredients for strong medium-term growth.</p><h4>What do you think EXPO 2020 will bring to the real estate sector and to Dubai's economy in general?</h4><p>There is no immediate and direct impact on the real estate market as a result of the 2020 Expo decision as the infrastructural expansion dedicated to this event has not yet been started. It does, however, further fuel positive sentiment and in particular has caused some international institutional investors to positively re-evaluate Dubai as an investment location. There does, however, have to be some caution shown by landlords who, in some cases, have tried to crystalize the “Expo effect" by increasing rents substantially. This action is not helpful to the long-term sustainability of Dubai's residential real estate market. As to the event itself, it sit very well with Dubai's medium-term strategy of attracting 20 million visitors by 2020, and perhaps a further five million visitors as a result of the Expo. This general tourism and leisure growth requires substantial amounts of real estate and generates a significant number of new jobs for the Emirate.</p><h4>Which of CBRE's products are the most profitable for you?</h4><p>CBRE's Middle East business is extremely well balanced between professional services and transactional services, and we are also lucky enough to have an extremely loyal client base across both these divisions. We see strong growth ahead particularly in respect of our commercial agency teams, our property management business, and our project management business. Our valuation and research teams also continue to be hungry for new professionals. Last year was a great year for us as all departments achieved growth, and I expect 2014 to be even better.</p><h4>How is CBRE improving or helping Dubai´s economy?</h4><p>We consider ourselves ambassadors for the country. There is quite some misunderstanding among corporations as to where Dubai sits in the context of the Middle East. Much of the news that comes from the region as a whole is negative. However, Dubai is a positive story and we take time to talk about opportunities in the competitive landscape that exists within the Middle East, principally within the UAE, and not exclusively in Abu Dhabi or in Dubai, but also in places such as Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>What kinds of projects do you undertake with the private sector?</h4><p>Our client base is split evenly between corporate and public sector work. The work that we do for the government entity is a form of consultancy, whereby we inform them on developments happening in the rest of the world. The fact that CBRE has roughly 500 offices around the world means that if there is a requirement to benchmark, for instance, or to look at some successful markets and at how the model would work in the Middle East, we can do this relatively easily. With regard to the private sector, we take time to look at retail and identify opportunities there. Retail is expending broadly and performing well by international standards. A key aspect of our business is looking at how retail businesses can pursue new routes into the market.</p><h4>For 2014, what will be the highlight for your investors in Dubai?</h4><p>We see an increasing number of investors from all over the world targeting Dubai, but this investment capital is partly frustrated by the lack of commercial investment stock available. I hope, therefore, that with Dubai's creation of an inbound investment office there will be a greater number of investment opportunities available to stimulate new capital flows into the Emirates.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Sasol is considered a pioneer in the GTL industry at large, and in Qatar specifically, having entered a joint venture with Qatar Petroleum on the ORYX GTL plant. How do you assess the commercial viability of such operations?</h4><p>It is no secret that the ORYX GTL plant is one of the most successful joint ventures in Qatar today. That is due to the combined resources of Qatar Petroleum, the lead partner in the joint venture, and Sasol. It is viable and it is successful. On the basis of the success that Sasol has been enjoying here in Qatar, we are now looking for other opportunities around the world. Gas conversion technology, however, has existed for over 60 years, and Sasol has been operating plants in South Africa using Fischer-Tropsch technology since 1952. What makes this one unique is that it is a low-temperature process, and therefore an economic venture.</p><h4>What future markets exist for diesel fuels that are created through the FT conversion process?</h4><p>Fuels created by gas conversion are inherently more environmentally friendly than conventional fuels created from fossil oil. There is a market demand for them, especially as GTL fuels are low in sulfur, they produce lower greenhouse gas emissions, and they have a high cetane number. Functionally speaking, GTL fuels are no different from petroleum-based fuels and can be used in two ways: as a fuel or as a blendstock.</p><div class="quote">“It is no secret that the ORYX GTL plant is one of the most successful joint ventures in Qatar today."</div><h4>Where are the products of the ORYX GTL plant exported?</h4><p>The ORYX GTL site currently produces three products. Some are for export and some are for domestic use. LPG, for example, is produced for domestic use in Qatar. Naphtha, a highly paraffinic product, is generally exported to Southern Asia and the Far East as cracker feedstock for chemical crackers and ethane crackers. The largest product by volume is diesel, which mainly goes to Europe and, more recently, to the Middle Eastern markets.</p><h4>What initiatives does Sasol undertake in order to ensure the sustainability of its operations here?</h4><p>Efficiency is core to our approach moving forward. In Qatar, we are looking at a higher level of carbon efficiency through the ORYX GTL plant. We're incorporating lessons learned in Qatar to maximize the efficiency of our next slate of projects. For example, there is an active program to reduce flaring, in line with Qatar's containment philosophy to have a lower carbon footprint. What we are learning from these modifications is that we can apply them in our new projects to lower their environmental impact and maintain the same level of production quality.</p><h4>What efforts with regard to corporate social responsibility (CSR) does Sasol focus on here in Qatar?</h4><p>Sasol is a company committed to the communities in which we operate. Our initiatives are aligned to support the Qatar National Vision 2030. For example, in 2012 we launched a program to highlight the abilities of people who are disabled, called “Definitely Able." Additionally, we are actively involved in supporting environmental issues. In partnership with Friends of the Environment Center Qatar, we are developing an application for smart phones and tablets that will bring the wealth of Qatar's bird and insect life to the palm of your hand. In April 2013, during the QP Environmental Fair, we brought a play from Lebanon that emphasized the importance of recycling to young people. These are just two examples of our investment in the community here in Qatar, a market to which we are committed for the long term.</p><h4>From a global perspective, how is the shale gas revolution affecting global markets, and how is that affecting Sasol specifically?</h4><p>Sasol has direct stakes in shale gas and is in a joint venture producing shale gas in Canada. We have seen in North America that shale has created a situation where there is a complete disassociation between the oil price and the gas price. The question is, what is the supply/demand balance in the future? It is clear to us that in the long term, demand for gas will rapidly increase, and shale will assist in meeting that demand. There has been a lot of new gas found off the coast of Africa, as well as in Australia and a number of other places. It looks like there will be a tight balance between supply and demand going forward. What we don't know is what will happen in terms of shale in China and other places in Europe. There is a lot of development on shale gas in the UK and other places. Whether demand will outstrip supply, only time will tell. Whatever the outcome, there is a continued need for self-sufficiency within markets, and this is based on having sufficient hydrocarbons and not having to import. GTL is one of the solutions available to gas-rich countries such as Qatar.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the energy sector in Qatar?</h4><p>For energy specifically, there is no indication that there will be an expansion of LNG production; however, there will be an expansion in refinery capacity for crude oil. That will produce growth, but it will depend on oil and gas prices. It is our understanding that the moratorium on an increased flow of gas from the North Field will be evaluated in the coming years. There is an indication that an increase of gas supply from the North Field will happen. There was a gas find that was announced in April 2013 of 2.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf). If there is an additional gas find, then in three to five years time there will be an increase in gas production. What we have found is that in Qatar it is looking at diversifying, meaning there are more C2, C3, and C4 going into gas treatment and chemicals. We have the two crackers with downstream production coming up, but that is petrochemicals. One of those crackers will be up and running by 2018, and that will start a different kind of increase, but not directly in energy. The energy sector depends very much on oil prices, and there is an indication that oil prices are a little bit softer, and that will impact on gas prices.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[a-local-undertaking]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What efforts are you making to address the needs of local and international companies in what has become a technology-heavy economy?</h4><p>Technology Control Company (TCC) is all about bringing in technologies from international companies. And, in 2008, when we the company was founded, we realized that there was a need for local critical solution ICT to be built utilizing the best technologies available. There is a distinct lack of technology transfer and a need for a local means of sourcing the latest technology for local firms. From the beginning we decided not to be box movers for international companies; we decided that we have to be a hands-on operation, keen on building our local capabilities. We are not resellers or distributors; we facilitate technology innovation for locals. There are certain niche sectors that we work in, such as security. Work in this area must be local and, therefore, our participation is key.</p><h4>In terms of security, what trends are you currently observing?</h4><p>Cyber security is a current trend that everyone is talking about. Business and personal consumption alike are today increasingly looking to cloud computing. Security has therefore become a crucial consideration and awareness is, in some ways, more important than the tools and techniques used to ensure it. Information is now shared and everything is mobile, which is precisely where we provide our services. We secure information from the end user to the service provider, and this instills confidence in the public when using their personal information. We are working in the areas of security and encryption; that is to say, making sure that end-user data is not in any way compromised. This is a large undertaking requiring considerable investment. We are developing a local service and participating with international partners to build and customize it. Additionally, analyzing data in Arabic also poses a challenge, and as a result of the demand our activity goes beyond simply providing technological capability.</p><h4>This year has been described as the Year of Encryption. Moving forward, do you have any plans for growth regionally?</h4><p>Yes, absolutely, as this is our core business. We have just launched our new secure token “Makeen." It is a national product, the first Saudi national encryption token, and the backbone for many encryption systems. The related device can encrypt and protect your data at a personal or corporate level. It was developed 100% by a local R&amp;D team. This said, we enjoy a healthy information exchange with experts at universities all over the world that enables us to expand our capability. We are training our Saudi team, which is a long-term process, but an essential one that will provide them with the skillset needed to develop their own techniques and methodology, and tailor it for the local market. We are in a position today to release a number of our products and offer our experience abroad, especially in the GCC. Security quite simply has to be a localized leveraging technology that is native to your region that can be customized for the local market. And by providing products to clients that they can then adjust instills considerable confidence.</p><div class="quote">“Business and personal consumption alike are today increasingly looking to cloud computing."</div><h4>In terms of your Saudi R&amp;D efforts, what are you doing to ensure that local information exchange is sustainable in the future?</h4><p>We have a program whereby new graduates work with us. They also participate in projects, thereby developing themselves, and work alongside our partners. We are building local capability because we believe that local knowledge is what we need to provide greater opportunities for ourselves and the wider industry.</p><h4>Technology, and especially encryption, is a very fast-moving field. What trends do you see on the horizon that you'll have to respond to going forward?</h4><p>Moving from a desktop network local to a wireless one, people increasingly conduct business by smartphone. They do not want to be dependent on a certain location at a certain time. We need to give them the flexibility to work from anywhere, and in order to do that we need to protect transmissions. Cyber security, in that respect, is more important than ever.</p><h4>Where do you hope to see TCC in five years in terms of growth and market position?</h4><p>We have a set strategy and are continuing to build our capability. We're also considering an entry into infrastructure, a new business line for us. TCC is therefore set to become a holding specialized in different critical solution systems. I hope that within five years we'll have become a regional company, with an especially strong presence in the GCC.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Shipping developed since starting in 2003?</h4><p>Oman Shipping Company was formed because there was a large volume of exports being moved on a freight-on-board (FOB) basis, where the buyer is responsible for the shipping, which meant we were losing the opportunity for a great deal of trade. Oman Shipping Company adds to the value chain of the Sultanate. For Omani producers, instead of shipping cargo only as far as the terminal, through Oman Shipping Company products can be delivered directly to the customer. We started in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, as all of our LNG was done on an FOB basis with around seven vessels, exporting predominantly to Japan and Spain. We have since decided to expand into the export of other products, such as chemicals and various refined oil products. Our portfolio basically consists of LNG vessels, product tankers, very large crude carriers (VLCCs), bulk carriers, and, recently, container ships. We are now quite diversified in terms of our shipping fleet. We currently operate about 42 vessels, whereas in 2003 we only had one vessel. Oman Shipping Company is fully owned by the government, 80% by the Ministry of Finance and 20% by Oman Oil Company, itself owned by the Ministry of Finance. One of the key strategies behind Oman Oil Company's participation as a shareholder is because it is the government's arm for investing in the energy sector, and so we are involved in many of its projects. Our major focus is on Oman and imports and exports, but if we do find opportunities where it makes sense for us to go ahead outside, then definitely we will do it. We are heavily involved in the imports and exports of Oman, and our key strategy is to enhance them.</p><h4>How do you cope with fluctuating global oil prices?</h4><p>Many of the vessels in our portfolio are on long-term charters, and so we are generally not affected by any fluctuation in the market. When the markets are low you maintain appropriate chartering, though whenever the market is high, you still get the fixed rate; this is a kind of long-term strategy. We do have a small portfolio that is subject to the market, and especially the crude market, which is very cyclical. Today's market for crude oil shipping is not what we would like it to be, but this will change. For example, before 2008, we were looking at rates over $100,000 a day just to charter one of these vessels. Today, we are talking about $7,000 to $20,000. The main reason for this is there was an oversupply of vessels as the market was high.</p><div class="quote">“With Duqm Port, the authorities are trying to attract what they call mother vessels."</div><h4>Where do you trade in the world?</h4><p>Our vessels trade worldwide. LNG is quite specific, however. It goes to Japan and Spain, and sometimes it goes to China when you have diversion cargoes. Fundamentally though, we do not control where the product goes. Our role is to provide the vessel, and make sure it is manned and technically managed—it is the charter who decides where to take it.</p><h4>How will Duqm build Oman's standing as a maritime hub?</h4><p>With Duqm Port, the authorities are trying to attract what they call mother vessels; huge containers that, instead of going to Jebel Ali, could stop at Duqm and save a huge amount of time. What they are trying to do is to have Duqm as the area to gather all these containers and then redistribute them through what they call “feeder vessels," like a trans-shipment port. But they also need to take into consideration the biggest competitor in the area, which is Jebel Ali, and which has the necessary infrastructure to support all major vessels in terms of logistics and services around the port's activities. Hopefully, we will be able to provide the same kind of infrastructure. Once we have the railroad, I am sure we will take a lot of business from Jebel Ali, because it is a lot more economical for the larger boats to come to Duqm, or even Salalah, than continuing on round the coast to Jebel Ali. The biggest advantage for the country is its strategic location. If you look at the Strait of Hormuz, it is a narrow corridor and a busy lane.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[route-canal]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will be the impact of the Panama Canal expansion?</h4><p>The Panama Canal expansion is an essential development, and this underpins the Panama Canal Authority's decision to proceed with the scheme. The planned investment is valued at around $5.25 billion, and we expect it to be complete in 1Q2015. We expect all the ports of the West and East coasts of the US, and also those in the Asia-Pacific region, to start adapting to accommodate the larger vessels that will pass through the canal. The new maximum capacity for a vessel coming through the canal will be about 50 feet deep. The majority of ships will hold up to 14,000 TEUs. Many ports know that they need funds to adapt to the new vessels. Hence, ports are expanding in Miami, Tampa, Savanna, Los Angeles, and Baltimore. The canal is going to be very important for them because much of the merchandise is destined to pass through them. Commerce is set to grow significantly, too. One of the main aspects of the expansion is that much of the natural gas coming from the US will go to South Korea, Japan, and China, the vessels of which will be able to pass through the canal. The canal is going to be an excellent route, enabling a greater volume of cargo between the US and Asia.</p><h4>What is the significance of the Pacific Alliance for Panama?</h4><p>The Pacific Alliance will be good for Panama. Today, Chile, Peru, Panama, and Mexico comprise 35% of the GDP of the entire Americas, and now Panama is set to be a part of that. We are in a country where we mostly sell services. We provide opportunities for investors to use Panama as a port of entry for goods that are being exported to all countries in the Alliance without incurring tax. I believe that it is important for us because this is a country where services contribute 82% to GDP. At the moment, we have treaties with three of the four countries, and I think that in 1Q2014 we can finish negotiations with Mexico. This agreement will grant Panama the opportunity to be part of the Pacific Alliance, which is a great source of excitement for us.</p><div class="quote">“The Panama Canal expansion is an essential development."</div><h4>In a recent visit by US Vice-President Joe Biden, he stated that relations between Panama and the US were at their best. What is your view on this?</h4><p>He saw the canal's current capability and its future possibilities, as well as what the US has been doing to prepare for the future. Also, he was very happy with how the Panamanian government is handling the country and expansion. For instance, he was pleasantly surprised with the quality of infrastructure in the country. He was also happy concerning the efforts being made to control and eradicate drugs in Panama. People are trying to smuggle illegal products through the Panama Canal; however, we recently stopped a boat that contained contraband ammunition and tools. I think the picture that he has of Panama today will serve future US relations well across the board.</p><h4>What are some of Panama's advantages as a destination for FDI?</h4><p>Currently, we have direct flights to Amsterdam, Madrid, and Paris, which are helping to attract visitors to Panama. When people see that major airlines are flying to Panama, it shows you that something is happening here in both the tourism and business markets. Air France has all of its seats fully booked five months in advance, for example. It is even considering upgrading from three flights a day to five. We always promote Panama as a point where all people from the Americas, Europe, and Asia meet to trade goods across Central America, North America, South America, and Europe. We have free trade agreements (FTAs) with the US, Europe, and certain countries in South America, such as Peru and Chile. We recently signed an FTA with Colombia and are in negotiations with Mexico, too. We have two free zones, one on the Atlantic coast and one on the Pacific coast. With that, we are opening up to the world. We are also improving our infrastructure by opening several new airports around the country.</p><h4>Following your recent visit to Taiwan, what is your outlook for relations with this country?</h4><p>Taiwan has an airline, EVA Air, which is part of the Star Alliance. Our main airline, 3, is also part of Star Alliance. However, they cannot do business together. Therefore, EVA Air is putting on more flights from Taipei to Latin America, while Copa is increasing frequency of flights from Latin America to Panama. We expect to see more people from Taiwan in Panama through these airlines via Latin America. Currently, it is impossible to fly from Taipei to Panama as it takes about 20 hours. However, we have a great deal of cooperation. We have a treaty and are sending goods, such as beef, to Taiwan. Also, we are trying to attract Taiwanese businesspeople to Panama allowing them to explore the advantages that Panama as a hub has in terms of sending information and merchandise from Taiwan to this region.</p><h4>With Panama growing three times faster than the Central America average, what is your economic outlook for the country and which sectors have the most growth potential?</h4><p>Ports are still going to be a very sound growth area. In fact, there are three new ports entering operation as a consortium, with two on the Atlantic, and one to shortly become our largest port. The latter port will be handled by the Panama Canal and will mainly be used for concessions. Its area of around 1,400 acres will provide companies with a logistics address, and we are heavily investing in both logistics and tourism. We are also promoting agriculture and financial services, as well as technology. We think that the commerce of Panama is excellent at attracting people from around the Americas. Yet the automotive market too is strong, and in 2013 sales grew by 20%, after 15% year-on-year growth in 2012. Banks offer seven-year loans on cars at an interest rate of around 7%-8%. Meanwhile, the free zone in Colombia is a major issue, and we also have difficulty with Venezuela, which is stalling our growth somewhat. The free zone accounts for around 50% of our GDP and, therefore, when a problem arises there, it impacts on GDP. However, in general, Panama is stable and enjoys solid activities. We also have a very important mining company that is planning to commence domestic operations in about three or four years with an investment of approximately $2 billion, but which is more likely to rise to $4 billion. When production starts, it expects an annual income of $2.3 billion with around $1 billion of that remaining in the economy annually. In short, we pursue activities that will promote further investment in Panama.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe your new facility in Santa Catarina, Nuevo Leon?</h4><p>The facility is a wind farm, a result of a joint effort made by Comexhidro Viento, Next Energy de México, and Conduit Capital, which, by using GE's latest technology, will benefit several municipalities surrounding Nuevo Leon. It will allow the districts to reduce the cost of electricity, while reducing pollution levels in the area. We have eight wind turbines of 2.75 MW, totaling 22 MW overall. The wind farm opened in June of 2013, and the performance to date has been impressive. However, its main impact will be seen in the reduction of the rates and tariffs that municipalities pay for public electricity.</p><h4>Is GE embracing wind energy on a wider scale?</h4><p>Mexico already has a solid framework for renewables, and we are certainly looking to participate more in this field and grow our business in it. And of course, any such undertaking would also need to complement our national energy resources portfolio. Certain areas are clearly more suited to the exploitation of wind energy, and we will continue to expand our operations there.</p><div class="quote">“A major factor is innovation and our continued investment in R&amp;D, which has been central to all GE operations."</div><h4>Was it a challenge to develop local talented players for your Queretaro engineering center?</h4><p>We are very proud of this center, where most of the engineers are working on turbines used in aviation and energy generation. They produce very high-quality work, and some extremely advanced aircraft components are being designed there, enabling us now to look into avionics. We are also looking to support the development of local engineering solutions for the oil and gas industry. Our cadre of around 1,700 engineers is expanding, possibly to over 2,200 people. Developing talent is key to the center's operations, and we have been fortunate in attracting local talent. We have teamed up with institutions to ensure we continue to do so. We enjoy a fruitful relationship with all the major technical universities in support of future talent and create further scholarships and programs for individual development. In fact, the first master class of aeronautical engineers graduated in 2012. Certain other companies undertake similar efforts in Queretaro, where the transformation observed has been amazing. This has already had an effect on the automotive industry, the supply chain for appliances, and the aerospace industry, and, as you know, there is a full cluster of aeronautical companies.</p><h4>What is the significance of Mexico for your company?</h4><p>We have long been committed to Mexico, which was home to our first plant established outside of the US. We have 18 manufacturing plants here, some of which are the most efficient of their kind in the world. The healthcare plant in Juárez has been the best in the world for the past two or three years. Most plants are geared toward exports, and so we are looking at ways to dedicate more capacity to products that are sold in Mexico itself. We continue to invest and introduce new lines, and if the oil and gas industry continues to grow it could provide an opportunity for us to support the key players in Mexico's energy production.</p><h4>What are the reasons behind your impressive growth?</h4><p>A major factor is innovation and our continued investment in R&amp;D, which has been central to all GE operations. Therefore, even in tougher times, we have an unflagging commitment to continued investment in all areas of our business. We continue to evolve our projects in the process making them more energy efficient. GE positions its portfolio of businesses by responding to global demands for infrastructure. We consistently invest in talent, regardless of the economic climate. And where necessary we export some of this talent, and there are certain leadership programs where you can observe the practice.</p><h4>What percentage of your income do you allocate to innovation and what is your attitude toward energy-efficiency programs?</h4><p>We allocate a huge 6% of our revenues to innovation, and spend over $1 billion on leadership programs in pursuit of excellence. Moreover, every product we produce aims for greater energy efficiency. For example, the new aircraft engines that we're looking at are 20%-30% more fuel efficient than previous models. We also focus heavily on the efficient use of data storage, and bear in mind that in the aeronautics industry an increase in efficiency of just 1% fuel savings in aviation could yield more than $30 billion in savings. Right now we are launching a new wind turbine of 2.2 MW, instead of the 1.7 MW design traditionally used, which proves that you can get more from the same coverage.</p><h4>What is the contribution of Mexico to your turnover for 2013?</h4><p>We measure ourselves more on orders and revenue than on net income figures by country. Latin America is a growth region for GE, and we hope to build on this. In Mexico we should achieve double-digit growth for 2013, and I expect 2014 to be the same. The target for growth regions is usually two to three times that of the overall economy, and we certainly expect this from Mexico going forward. Depending on how national reforms shape up, we view this positively, and if we are able to generate a further 1.5% GDP growth from those reforms, we should see it in our own numbers.</p><h4>Are you positive about the impact of the reforms?</h4><p>We think that in general the impact should be positive; however, we still have to explore the details, in particular with regard to energy reform. Secondary laws will explain just how this will all work. Without doubt there are tremendous opportunities to be reaped from the energy sector. And so combining all of the reforms together is positive in general, and should benefit growth, promote investment, and create jobs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the country and your company?</h4><p>For 2014-2015 we foresee gradual growth linked to that of the economy. Thereafter, should the reforms pan out as required we could see a minor increase in performance. If some of the larger projects in the energy arena materialize, we could increase our growth faster in the medium term. For the short term we anticipate moderate growth. We view these things in a couple of ways. We would have a stronger competitive position given the availability of better energy. We are very committed to the country and to leveraging some of the expertise and best practices we have used here in other countries as we engage with new industries, such as oil and gas. In deep-water exploration, too, we have expertise in other parts of the world that could be brought to support our customers in Mexico.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the success of UCL's first year in Qatar?</h4><p>It was extremely interesting to see the diversity of the students that we attracted. We offer three different Master's programs, with 29 students participating. We had originally hoped for 24 students, with eight in each program, so when we took on almost 30 students we were particularly satisfied. These students come from 13 or 14 different countries; nine are Qatari, and roughly one-third are from elsewhere in the region, and others from even further afield, like Europe and the US. As it was our first academic year, certain programs have required adjustment to adapt to the market needs and realities of the country. An example of this is technical and scientific training in our MSc in Conservation, a new course for the country that relies heavily on chemistry and material science. For this you need sophisticated laboratories and chemicals, and because a license is required for everything in Qatar, we had to adapt to accommodate these limitations. It has therefore been a learning curve for us, although we are happily entering our second year, with student recruitment almost twice what it was at the same time in 2012. Recruitment is working well through word-of-mouth and advertising, as well as through our collaboration with museums and international organizations. Real-world work experience is a crucial part of our programs, and we make sure that the students gain practical experience from their work placements. In addition, many of the placements take place in Qatar.</p><h4>Does UCL Qatar teach an international approach to managing museums?</h4><p>We teach an international approach to museum studies and conservation, but with a focus on what is needed and relevant in Qatar and the region. This is a booming region where a lot of big museum projects are underway. They need good content for the museums and outstanding exhibits, but they also need a strategy for interacting with their societies. Our programs in London are the same in terms of the admissions process and the degree, but the focus is different, as we are operating in a different environment.</p><div class="quote">“This is a booming region where a lot of big museum projects are underway."</div><h4>What are your thoughts on the development of a cultural atmosphere in Qatar?</h4><p>The Qatar National Vision 2030 states that people need to understand cultural values and develop an awareness of this in order to shape their own national identity. It also spells out the need to attract highly skilled expatriates to come and work here and to make them feel genuinely comfortable living here. Perhaps we can play a part in this by providing and organizing enlightening public lectures and events, and by contributing to the dynamic museums environment. This is a booming region with many large museum projects underway. They need good content and outstanding exhibits, but they also need a strategy for interacting with their societies. We have a dual role: to help make Qatar a more attractive place for skilled expatriate workers, and also to help the country develop its own national identity. We operate an intensive program of ongoing professional development that we deliver specifically for the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA), with six or seven of their staff reading for MA programs with us. We are partnered equally with QMA and Qatar Foundation. Our teaching includes visiting lecturers from UCL London who deliver intensive courses, providing more academic diversity than our nine faculty members could alone.</p><h4>What synergies exist between UCL in Qatar and the home campus in London?</h4><p>Being able to draw on UCL in London is important for us. Our close relationship with the UCL Institute of Archaeology means we can provide much more academic diversity than our nine faculty members could provide by themselves. Our teaching includes visiting lecturers from London who deliver intensive courses. Students may spend time in UCL-operated museums in London and get a chance to see how UCL works from the inside. We actively explore how we can broaden our students' experience.</p><h4>How would you like to see UCL expand in the short term?</h4><p>In addition to the MA in Archaeology, the MSc in Conservation, and the MA in Museum and Gallery Practice, we have launched an MA in Library and Information Studies, and a Diploma in Academic Research and Methods with the first students enrolling in late 2013. The latter is aimed at well-qualified candidates of notable potential. It is a six-month program that serves as a pre-Master's preparatory course. We hope to continue welcoming a practical number of students to each course. We will also attempt to expand further and respond more fully to market needs. Qatar finds itself increasingly at the forefront of academic knowledge and education with the goal of developing a knowledge-based economy. We can assist in this by providing advanced technical methods for studying the past and the interaction between people and their environment. Many of the sites that are being studied today are in the waters around Qatar, with the water level having risen over time. I think that the study of these settlements and attempts to understand how people treated the environment and moved around is particularly important for a country like Qatar, which contributes significantly to climate change.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The UAE's ICT sector is one of the most advanced markets in the Arab World according to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA). What' is your outlook on the sector and what are the main drivers of growth?</h4><p>In summary, the outlook for the sector continues to remain positive. This is due to a variety of factors including: a history of savvy investment and commercial decisions from the UAE's telecommunications service providers; the continued effective maintenance of, and investment in, telecommunications networks; and the ongoing strengthening of the sector's regulatory framework. These factors will be further buoyed by a positive economic outlook for the UAE and recovering global markets. Broadband has the potential to be a significant driver of growth for the telecommunications sector in the UAE. The UAE has one of the most advanced broadband networks in the world, utilizing the latest technologies that are capable of delivering extremely high-speed services. The challenge is now for telecommunications service providers to secure the growth potential that these networks offer by promoting a compelling set of packages to customers at competitive prices. In particular, if the licensees are successful in encouraging their subscribers to migrate to higher speed broadband services, thus enabling them to benefit from the existence of the UAE's high-speed networks, significant financial gains could be made. It should also be recognized that the UAE is still, after many years, continuing to experience robust growth in the uptake of mobile services. Mobile number portability (MNP) has recently been introduced, and we may potentially observe some interesting developments in the mobile services sector as licensees compete aggressively to retain and acquire new customers. Furthermore, fixed-line telephony service penetration levels are also continuing to grow; a situation that is in stark contrast to the majority of other countries worldwide where uptake levels have been falling rapidly.</p><h4>What improvements are you planning for 2014?</h4><p>In 2014, the TRA is placing a strong focus on further strengthening its corporate culture of excellence in order to facilitate the achievement of the vision and mission of the TRA. Within this context, a series of internal projects are underway to optimize the TRA's internal procedures and processes, and to ensure its way of doing things is in line with international best practice. The TRA also intends to place increased emphasis on improving the UAE's rankings in various international ICT indicators. This will force us to consider what measures we should introduce, and what changes are appropriate, in order for the UAE to be considered one of the best in the world in terms of its overall ICT ecosystem. The TRA will also continue to engage with third-party stakeholders throughout the regulatory decision-making process to ensure the views of all affected parties are considered. The TRA recently established the first ever Electronic Federal Network (FedNET) in the UAE. FedNET will provide high-speed connectivity and integration between the various information systems of UAE government departments. The network will connect all federal institutions in a way that raises efficiency and reduces costs. It will also help achieve a faster transition to smart government. Upon official completion of the implementation process, FedNET will provide information technology services within a collaborative and secure environment in order to efficiently meet the needs of the public. FedNet will facilitate the delivery of shared services and cloud services to federal entities. Both types of services will work toward achieving the necessary enablement and integration among services delivered through federal entities' e-government services. The project implementation started in the beginning of 2014 and is expected to be completed over a period of 18 months. FedNET is one of the initiatives falling under the mGovernment (mobile government) transformation roadmap, which focuses on establishing shared resources across various UAE government entities. In addition to FedNET, the project includes additional services including interconnectivity, digital identity, payment channels, cloud services, a trusted service manager, and mobile innovation center. The TRA has coordinated one of the first cross-role, cross-organization mobile technology training programs focused on government services in the world. Over the course of 2H2013, TRA and a team of international mobile technology experts assessed the various levels of readiness across different federal ministries, Emirate agencies, and municipal smart government groups. The findings from those assessment activities resulted in the creation of a flexible and scalable curriculum that will be presented across the UAE. Four role-based courses will be delivered in the program, including: mGov innovation training for managers, a four-day course focused on understanding how to best manage mobile technology complexity and increase the quality of mGov services; enabling IT staff to support mGov services through four days of in-depth technical discussions and hands-on labs to let IT staff experience mobile technologies first hand; and application development essentials for design and strategy over four days of application design experiences to help drive the development of high-quality mGov services. Over the course of the program in 2014, thousands of government staff will be trained and assessed. Training participants will be able to receive follow-on help from the TRA should they need it during the course of any mGov projects through mentors and trainers available at the TRA's Center of Digital Innovation. The ultimate goal of the TRA mGov Training Program is to help UAE government staff to achieve their full potential when it comes to deploying high-quality mGov services.</p><div class="quote">“The UAE provides a favorable and competitive environment for businesses."</div><h4>In an interview with Dubai Internet City's CEO, he mentioned that the availability of investors, political stability, access to thousands of international businesses, and a developed ICT society all contribute to making the UAE a compelling destination for entrepreneurship and new start-ups. What's your view on this?</h4><p>I strongly agree with this comment. There is no single factor that determines whether a specific location is attractive for prospective businesses. Instead, a range of factors are considered and the overall desirability of a particular location is determined by the extent to which that location can meet all of the businesses' individual requirements. One of the key areas of focus for the TRA is in ensuring that the delivery of ICT services in the UAE provides a favorable and competitive environment for businesses. This means that it's vital that telecommunications providers in the UAE offer a broad range of high-quality, reliable services at a reasonable cost. It is well known that telecommunications networks in the UAE are highly advanced. Prices are also generally competitive when considered on a regional level, and, indeed, mobile telephony prices are considered low by international standards. Further regulatory measures, such as the proposed introduction of the bitstream access service, a form of infrastructure sharing, will be expected to reduce the price of telecommunications services further in the future. The fundamental idea of the UAE's wise leadership is progress built on a knowledge-based economy. This is endorsed in the UAE Vision 2021, which sets goals for our country in the social, economic, health, educational, and related fields. The UAE Vision 2021 states that, “the UAE will become one of the best places in the world to do business." The UAE's laws, policies, and government services aim to promote businesses and push economic growth while securing the harmony of interests of the parties involved. The UAE's federal eGovernment program and the mobile government initiative aim to achieve this goal. In fact, the results can already be seen in the Ease of Doing Business 2014 report, jointly published by The World Bank and the International Finance Corporation. The UAE stood at 23rd amongst 189 countries assessed on the basis of regulations and framework for starting and conducting a business. The UAE government offers several such services through the electronic platform in a timesaving and cost-effective way with a focus on reducing paperwork.</p><h4>Approximately 85% of UAE residents have an internet connection. What does this figure mean for the TRA?</h4><p>The fact that 85% of UAE residents have an internet connection means a number of things. First, it means that the telecommunications providers in the UAE have done a good job in promoting the uptake of internet services. Second, it indicates that the TRA has, to date, offered a sound regulatory framework to facilitate the continued uptake of internet services. The challenge now is to ensure the regulatory framework remains appropriate for the continually changing needs of consumers and internet service providers. Third, it underscores that the time is right for businesses and government entities to invest in providing online services to consumers and residents. Such services have the potential to improve the efficiency of the organizations that provide the services by reducing the need for a consumer/resident facing presence, while the availability of such services can save significant time for users of the relevant service. Fourth, it indicates that businesses may need to alter the methods they use to reach and interact with potential customers. In particular, businesses that fail to provide an online presence may face difficulties in acquiring and retaining customers. Consumer behavior has changed as a result of the emergence of the internet, and so too must the behavior of businesses. In terms of the significance of the ICT sector for Dubai, we know that it's absolutely vital. The TRA recently commissioned an independent study to measure the macroeconomic impact of the telecommunications sector on the UAE's economy. On a conservative basis, it was estimated that, overall, the sector contributed around 8% of total UAE GDP in 2012, equivalent to AED106 billion. This figure includes both the direct impact, consisting of the contribution of the licensed telecommunications service providers and retailers, as well as an indirect impact that includes the productivity gains that accrue in the economy as a result of, for example, the ability of telecommunications services to increase the speed of communication and the diffusion of innovation.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>We last spoke with you for our 2012 edition. How has AmCham's role and membership changed and developed over that two-year period?</h4><p>As far as our role is concerned, we have worked very hard on advocacy for our members. Our ability to advocate strongly is continuously evolving, as is our relationship with senior levels of the government of Kazakhstan. We aim to work closely with the government, mainly through our regular meetings with the Prime Minister and Cabinet Ministers, to express our opinions and our members' opinions. We also coordinate, cooperate, and are supportive of government initiatives like the green economy and healthcare reform, working together with the ministers responsible for these initiatives. AmCham membership also changes from year to year. This is a healthy phenomenon, and something we work at to achieve. There are always new members joining, while others may be leaving the country or downsizing. The membership now consists primarily of large companies, but with a healthy mixture of small- and medium-sized companies. This reflects the current situation in Kazakhstan, as it is difficult for entrepreneurial start-ups and small companies to operate, and many do not last long. Larger companies inevitably have greater experience and resources, and many have operated in Russia and Ukraine or elsewhere in the CIS. This enables them to successfully navigate the difficulties common to this region. The government has set the goal of economic diversification, aiming to promote and support entrepreneurship, but the business environment is still extremely difficult for small businesses.</p><h4>What do you think needs to be done to make the environment more inviting for smaller businesses?</h4><p>There needs to be a realistic effort to open up the business environment for small companies, to encourage fresh ideas and innovative approaches, and to fill niches presently unoccupied. Instead, a lot of pressure is brought to bear from the tax authorities and financial regulation. Corruption and bribery is also a continuing problem. Small companies find it very hard to fight corruption since they don't have teams of lawyers or deep pockets to sustain battles against bureaucracy and the courts. This is not a problem only for SMEs, but for the larger companies that feel struggles of this nature distract them from their priority to build a healthy business. As for tax disputes, these are common in the corporate environment in many countries, but they are dealt with differently here. In Kazakhstan, such disputes are criminalized very quickly. The accepted practice in developed countries is to negotiate to resolve such disputes. Kazakhstan should adopt this approach, which would save time in finding an equitable solution without resorting to the criminal courts.</p><h4>What action has the government taken to improve the business environment?</h4><p>The government speaks a great deal about improving the business environment, but change is slow to come. A major plus is that corporate taxes are decreasing year by year, but legal and judicial reform has not progressed sufficiently and labor legislation, particularly relating to visas and work permits for foreign staff at foreign companies, creates major difficulties. Local content, meaning services, supplies, and staffing, is being pushed hard. The intention is to promote local businesses and to increase local employment, but quality and expertise are not always at the desired level. Of course foreign companies would be more than willing to source their supplies and services from local suppliers because it would entail significant savings. However, sectors requiring a high level of technological or other expertise, such as the oil industry, require top-quality equipment and services. They cannot operate otherwise. These companies have asked the government for more time to allow local companies to meet international standards and to train the specialized engineers needed for these industries. Another point of concern is the recent formation of the National Chamber of Entrepreneurs, created by the government last summer and entailing mandatory membership for all businesses, large and small, foreign and domestic, operating in Kazakhstan. This will create a chamber with over 1 million members. The largest members, defined as those with revenue of over $20 million per year, a modest threshold for a company that will encompass many AmCham members, will be required to pay annual membership fees of $50,000. The stated intention is to support small businesses, but it is not clear how this will be done. The chamber also has a quasi-political structure that appears more of a step back into the past than forward into the future. It remains to be seen what will come of this new government initiative, which will fully enter into force in 2015.</p><div class="quote">“AmCham grows year by year at an average rate of 20% and our membership diversity continues to increase."</div><h4>AmCham works closely with the government via the Prime Minister's Council to Improve the Investment Climate, a body created specifically for AmCham as the leading foreign investors' business association in Kazakhstan. How has this partnership contributed to a more enticing environment for investors?</h4><p>The Prime Minister's Council is a unique creation by the government and a good platform for dialogue between senior government policymakers and the business community. With regard to ongoing investor issues such as taxes, legal problems, and environmental and labor issues, we have brought up all of those subjects and begun serious debate on them. Each meeting consists of presentations by leading AmCham member companies, the five ambassadors from the US, the UK, the EU, Canada, and Switzerland, who are also part of the Council, and the ministers who are invited to attend the Council when a topic falling into their area of responsibility is up for discussion. There are many talented policymakers in the government, but progress is sometimes slow. Compared to other countries in the region, Kazakhstan is an excellent model for development, and this openness to dialogue is one of the country's most attractive characteristics. Foreign businesses that have been operating elsewhere in the CIS for a decade or more say it is easier here, and that Kazakhstan has a more open business environment, despite being a smaller market compared to Russia, for example.</p><h4>AmCham held the Economic Policy Forum on Healthcare Reform in 2013. What opportunities are open to foreign investors in this sector?</h4><p>Healthcare is a priority area for development in Kazakhstan, and business can play a very positive role in this. Updated medical schools and medical education is very much needed, but technology, management expertise, public health strategies involving new taxation approaches, and legal reform to rethink the responsibility of healthcare to the public and to private healthcare institutions are all needed. Kazakhstan inherited a Soviet health system that fell into decay. The government now devotes significant resources to improve and refashion healthcare, but this is a sensitive area that is a work in progress. Most people here, if they can afford it, still go abroad for medical treatment. This needs to be rectified, and the business community can help. The AmCham healthcare sector of the membership has grown significantly in the past few years, and many companies that had not previously considered health a growth industry now have prioritized it for the years ahead.</p><h4>What does the future hold for AmCham?</h4><p>AmCham grows year by year at an average rate of 20% and our membership diversity continues to increase. I personally am quite internationally attuned, so I constantly looking for countries and companies not currently represented by AmCham. I would love for it to become a UN of businesses. In addition to our traditional North American and European membership, I am glad to see that the Asia Pacific is growing, and by that I do not mean just China, but also the presence of companies from Japan, Korea, and Australia, plus firms from the UAE and many Turkish companies. It is a good mixture, and we find that we are all on the same wavelength when it comes to the issues that are of concern to us. AmCham itself has grown in terms of office space since the last time we met TBY, which reflects that we are doing a lot more in every way. We have 15 working groups, and all of those based in Almaty meet here. There are six groups in Almaty, four in Atyrau, several in Aktau, and more in Astana, too, and all are extremely active advocates for their business communities. It is not just the chief executives who visit the Prime Minister to voice concerns. AmCham members are active from the ground up, and the working groups express their views from the operational level. The groups often petition the government on certain issues, and then we take those issues into our meetings with the Prime Minister. They have become articulate and focused on the changes they hope to bring about. This is one of many reasons why I have high hopes for the future.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Franco-UAE trade relations?</h4><p>The UAE and France have strong and confident historical ties. Since the establishment of the Federation, leaders on both sides have cultivated an exceptional relationship that has strengthened trust and complicity, which benefits our trade and economic relationship. The UAE has become in recent years a strategic economic partner of France in the Middle East. Absorbing ‚¬3.53 billion of our exports, the UAE is our primary commercial market in the Gulf. Our bilateral trade generated a positive balance of ‚¬2.37 billion in 2012, the fourth largest global surplus for our country. Our exports are based on four sectors: food processing, aerospace, electrical and mechanical equipment, and consumer goods, including luxury goods. Our imports are mainly comprised of petroleum products (about 80%). Major French groups have long been established in the UAE and cover a wide variety of sectors, including oil, aviation, banking, insurance, retail, hospitality, and transport. In addition to this, several major projects have been carried out by French companies. Our dynamic bilateral trade relationship is reflected in growing interest from our businesses in the UAE. Today, we count 600 French companies in the country, and their numbers increase steadily by 10% annually. This is a sign of the UAE's dynamic economy. It also shows the performance of our companies, large and small, where their technologies and know-how meet the expectations of a country in search of the most innovative technologies.</p><h4>What priorities do you assign to economic cooperation between France and Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>Regarding our largest commercial market, we hope to maintain the density of our trade by increasing our market share in the country. Due to increasingly fierce foreign competition in the UAE, today more than ever, we must continue to intensify our efforts to strengthen our position in a market that is one of the most dynamic and most creditworthy in the Middle East. First and foremost, it is important that our champions, including Total, GDF Suez, Technip, Veolia, EADS, Airbus, Alstom, Thales, BNP, Société Générale, and Carrefour, successfully position themselves for major equipment programs launched in the emirate: the development of the oil sector and renewable energy, urban transport metro, tram, and bus projects in Abu Dhabi, and civil aviation, particularly in its industrial components. Secondly, it seems to me essential to reinforce the presence of our SMEs, whose expansion in the UAE remains insufficient. Several sectors are profitable for them; in particular, I think hydrocarbons, urban development, food, health, environment, and biotechnology. To this end, I place great emphasis on concerted actions designed to lend more visibility to our know-how. Thus, in the field of urban development we have launched an initiative that unites the French offer as a whole by creating Vivapolis, a real brand that promotes the French sustainable city, which will help our companies to succeed in the international marketplace in this sector. Vivapolis brings together more than 80 large and small companies that can provide global solutions to meet all the challenges of intensive urban development.</p><div class="quote">“France has put in place a very strong support system for companies established in the Gulf."</div><h4>At an institutional level, how does France organize itself in Abu Dhabi to support its business?</h4><p>To enhance economic development in Abu Dhabi and the Federation, France has put in place a very strong support system for companies established in the Gulf. This system is coordinated by the Economic Department of the Embassy. It includes a large office called UBIFRANCE, the French Trade Commission, which supports SMEs in their exports across the UAE by offering market analysis services, prospecting, and networking. It is also in charge of promoting the French offer, in terms of organizing French joint stands within the largest trade shows in Abu Dhabi and Dubai as well as individual technological conferences. Our companies can network with the French Chamber of Commerce here through the French Business Group (FBG), which promulgates advice and assistance and promotes the local integration of our businesses that get established in the Emirate. We also have a savvy businessmen section which gathers 30 men and women from the French business community in the UAE, named the “Foreign Trade Advisors of France," whose mission is to share their knowledge of the field with other businesses, especially SMEs that wish to enter the UAE market. I also want to mention the presence of an office of the French Agency for International Investment (IFA), which aims to facilitate the UAE investments in France, the office of Atout France, in charge of promoting the French offer and cooperation in the field of tourism, as well as SOPEXA to promote agribusiness. Some French regions, such as Rhí´ne-Alpes and Lorraine, have opened a representative office in the UAE to support the work of their companies.</p><h4>What are the issues surrounding the renewal of concessions for your oil champion, Total, and what are the factors behind its success?</h4><p>It is evident that the renewal of the partnership with Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) is a high priority for Total in relation to the size of the onshore oil fields of Abu Dhabi and the special relationship between the authorities of the Emirate and our oil group. Total Group provides ongoing technical assistance and provides staff. For over 50 years, it has been closely associated with the development and prosperity of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, and it is now the largest investor-partner of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Abu Dhabi in the energy sector. Total is committed to working with the UAE in the development of energy resources of the future, whether in its historical areas of excellence—oil and gas—or new energies, based on a long-term approach. Total Group is committed to sharing its expertise and technology to maintain its position as a major partner of ADNOC.</p><h4>The Abu Dhabi Investment Forum was held in Paris last May, in the presence of an Emirati government delegation from the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and more than 200 senior French officials, businessmen, and investors. What are your feelings on this forum? What lessons do you draw from it on the bilateral relationship between France and Abu Dhabi?</h4><p>It was a great pleasure for me to welcome the Abu Dhabi Investment Forum in Paris. I was very sensitive to the fact that the government of Abu Dhabi has decided to hold this forum in France, and I would like to thank the Chairman of the Abu Dhabi Department of Economic Development and all his delegation for the quality of this symposium, which aimed to promote economic relations between our two countries. The last event of its kind held in Paris dates back to 2007, so an event such as this one was long overdue. The Abu Dhabi Investment Forum in Paris allowed us to measure how important the investment opportunities are in strategic sectors such as industry, energy, transport, trade, finance, education, and tourism. The opportunities were so interesting that the government delegation from Abu Dhabi clearly expressed its desire to see more French companies, especially SMEs, positioning themselves on major projects for the economic diversification of the Emirate. The large number of French companies present has assessed the expectations of our business community vis-í -vis the UAE market. They were able to interact directly with key decision makers in the UAE, and I think I can say that this conference has fully achieved its objectives. I sincerely hope that it can be renewed in 2014 and am ready to give my full support to its organization.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the extent of the company's aluminum, alunite, and ferrous mining and processing activities, and its position in the mining sector?</h4><p>Det.Al is a leading group of companies in the Azerbaijani non-ferrous industry that produces aluminum oxide (alumina), primary aluminum, and semi-final aluminum products of bauxite and alunite ore. In light of our activities, we are pleased that 2014 was proclaimed the “Year of Industry." This initiative is part of a wider industrialization policy carried out on a large scale in Azerbaijan, through which hundreds of industrial enterprises have been built and a strong potential created in this area starting from the 1970s and 1980s. As in other sectors of the economy, great success has been achieved in the development of industry and the volume of industrial production increased by a factor of 2.7 in the last decade alone. Modern competitive industrial fields have been established, numerous projects have been implemented to improve industrial infrastructure, new workplaces have been created, and the country's industry has entered a new stage of development.</p><h4>You have just announced the production of semi-fabricated materials at a new smelter. How do you expect the production, sale, and export of these products to develop over the coming years?</h4><p>In 2012, when President HE Ilham Aliyev inaugurated Det.Al's aluminum complex's first phase, he noted that “a new period has begun in the Azerbaijan metallurgical industry." There is no doubt that the President's sagacious internal and external politics have helped with the development of the non-oil sector, the expansion of investment programs, the protection of macroeconomic stability, and the implementation of industrial capacity building programs, which have all had a positive impact on the activities and development of Det.Al. This approach to economic growth is guided by the “from a strong economy to strong state" principle. The inauguration of Det.Al's aluminum complex in January 2012, the annual capacity of which is 50,000 tons, and the inauguration of the Det.Al aluminum semi-final production plant in January 2014, exemplify the success of this growth strategy. Det.Al's metal casting and continuous rolling plant and the rolling and coating plant both have an annual capacity of 50,000 tons and meet international standards. The main contractor that built the two new plants was China Non-Ferrous Metals Processing Technology Co., Ltd (CNPT). The contractor has been in charge of building large-scale aluminum plants in China belonging to Chinalco and Chalco, so the company has a formidable reputation and over 45 years of experience in the non-ferrous metal processing field. In addition to Chinalco, the company's clients also include Canada's Alcan, Alcoa of the US, and Switzerland's Hydro. During the production and installation of equipment in order to meet our demands, the producer assumed European standards as a basis to ensure the quality of the products. The most important components originate from the US, Italy, Germany, and Japan. The liquid aluminum extracted from the electrolysis baths is transported to the metal casting and continuous rolling plant for the production of 50,000 tons of aluminum continuous casting coils with a thickness of 6 mm-8 mm per year. These coils serve as raw materials for the production of flat rolled products. Two new fields were established in the newly opened rolling and coating plant, namely the cold rolling area, with 50,000 tons in annual production capacity, and the coating area, with 17,000 tons in annual production capacity. The products will be used in the production of automobile parts, the chemical and food industry, construction, electric materials, communication cables, freezer chambers, piping systems, kitchen equipment, high-pressure chambers, fuel tanks, storage tanks, metal cans, lids for glass cans, and other packaging materials.</p><div class="quote">“Det.Al's newly opened aluminum semi-final production plants will contribute to the development of the non-oil sector."</div><h4>What does Det.Al's collaboration with international institutions consist of?</h4><p>In order to export manufactured products, contracts have already been signed with Turkish, Italian, Polish, Egyptian, Russian, and Ukrainian companies. The companies are satisfied with the quality of the products that we send. We are currently working on producing final goods from aluminum semi-finished products. Efforts are underway to build new plants for the production of foil for technical and food products, different types of sandwich panels, wire, and other final goods. Det.Al's newly opened aluminum semi-final production plants will contribute to the development of the non-oil sector, the diversification of the economy, the strengthening of the industrial potential of the regions, the country's industry, and the non-ferrous metallurgical industry.</p><h4>What efforts does the company make to meet international standards?</h4><p>At present, the certification process is continuing. Det.Al is cooperating with major certification companies that have great reputations in the international certification field. The result of the audit process shows that for manufactured products the institute will be awarded the EN 573-3, EN 485-1, EN 485-2, and EN 485-4 certification of compliance, the quality management system ISO 9001:2008, and the ISO 14001 Environmental Management System and OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety Management System certificates.</p><h4>How is Det.Al contributing to job creation in Azerbaijan?</h4><p>The newly built aluminum semi-final production plants will stimulate job creation, carrying out the production of new goods in the region. They will assist in the development of SMEs in the country, the reinforcement of industrial potential in the regions of Azerbaijan, and the creation of new non-oil industry institutes, causing the formation of industrial development opportunities on the basis of innovation. We are proud of realizing our motto; “from strong economy to strong state," and of playing a role in Azerbaijan's development into a highly developed economy in the region and around the world, thus supporting the development policy of our President, HE Ilham Aliyev.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess bilateral relations between Panama and the US?</h4><p>We enjoy a rich history of positive bilateral relations with the US. Our ties are a key element in our foreign affairs policies and strategy. This has always been the case, regardless of the administration in power.</p><h4>How have ties with the EU evolved since the signing of the free trade agreement (FTA) in August 2013?</h4><p>Following the signing of this FTA, relations between Panama and the EU definitely changed and ensured stronger regional ties between Central America and Europe. This, along with the fact that Panama is the main investment partner of the EU in the region, also means more responsibility for our country when looking at ties between Panama and the EU. The trade pillar is, of course, accompanied by both a political and cooperative agreement. It will lead our country to put more emphasis on global matters that have importance also for the EU. We have shown this by being more outspoken on the Syrian and Iranian situation, both of which are pressing issues for Brussels.</p><div class="quote">“I think that for the last five years we have achieved a lot at a regional level and in placing Panama in the international arena."</div><h4>Since Panama has shown interest in being part of the Pacific Alliance, what's the relevance of such a partnership for the country?</h4><p>Joining the Pacific Alliance is a normal and natural move for Panama, a country that has been moving forward in terms of regional trade integration. In this context, we are already partners with the founding members of the Alliance and we aim at closing a future agreement with Mexico, a country with which we have also had long historical ties. We are confident and hopeful to conclude a trade agreement with Mexico before President Martinelli finishes his term in office. Therefore, taking this context into consideration, it is only normal that Panama advances to a new stage, which is joining the Pacific Alliance. If we have not done it before, it has been due to technical issues regarding the conclusion of trade agreements with some of the members of the Alliance. Ultimately, we see the Pacific Alliance as a key element for advancing our strategy to become closer with Asia. In fact, Martinelli's administration has always stated its aim to sign trade agreements with South Korea and, hopefully, Japan. We also have an important flow of trade with China. The Pacific Alliance is to become a key element in the process of the transformation and development of Panama's foreign affairs policies and strategies.</p><h4>How could Panama benefit from closer ties with the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean region?</h4><p>I think both countries can benefit from closer ties; the Dominican Republic considers itself as a gateway to the Caribbean region, something Panama also believes of itself, in terms of transport, capacity and trade. It is normal and natural for Panama to have such a belief, as we are both situated in the middle of the American continent. I think Panama is another platform for Caribbean countries, and therefore we can complement each other in a balanced way. For us, bilateral ties with the Dominican Republic are key and they have helped us to better address issues in the Caribbean region and to better understand its realities.</p><h4>Which sectors have the most potential to further develop trade ties with the Dominican Republic?</h4><p>Panama is a services-oriented economy, so we believe that we can provide the Dominican Republic with excellent services to support its foreign trade. At the same time, I think we can benefit from light-manufacturing works from the Dominican Republic. For example, the light-manufacturing sector could benefit significantly from closer ties between both countries, as well as the agriculture industry. In this context, the agriculture industry would also include equipment, fertilizers, and related products.</p><h4>What are your foreign affairs priorities for 2014?</h4><p>As a minister, I want to put more emphasis on finishing off President Martinelli's term in as successful a way as possible. When I took charge of the ministry I promised to take Panama's foreign affairs vessel to a safe port. I think that for the last five years we have achieved a lot at a regional level and in placing Panama in the international arena. I want to consolidate the good relations that have been established during this term. In addition, I will continue pushing forward that idea of Panama as a small but influential country, whose main goal is to engage with all the international players while working to preserve the interests of our country. That sort of standing will be Martinelli's legacy at the end of his term, and we have to hand over a positive aggregate after five years of working at the helm of the ministry.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You began your tenure on very strong footing, at the helm of a robust and diversified stock market that accounts for 77% of the region's liquidity. In 2014, many new IPOs are expected. How will you deal with these new entrants, and what are your plans moving forward?</h4><p>Our new X-Stream INET trading platform, the latest in NASDAQ OMX's trading technologies, which is to be deployed by the end of 2014, is more than capable of accommodating all future IPOs, both from a local context, but also from a regional perspective, particularly if you consider the likelihood of cross-listings. The platform is also highly customizable and can accommodate the listing and trading of multiple security formats, which positions us well for future developments in the capital market. It is also worth noting that a recent regulatory policy initiative is also set to have an impact on the way we deal with IPOs. In fact a number of activities have been underway focused on updating processes in the primary and secondary markets. To put this into context it is worth revisiting the Capital Market Authority's 2012 annual report, which was published in 1Q2013, within which HE Mohammed Abdulmalik Al Sheikh, the Chairman and CEO of the Capital Market Authority (CMA), in his first statement to the market, outlined four primary initiatives for implementation, foremost amongst which was the application of Chapter Three of the Capital Market Law, which defines the roles and responsibilities, authorities, and controls prescribed on the Saudi Stock Exchange. The outcome of this regulatory initiative will not only empower the Saudi Stock Exchange by allowing us to activate our full scope of responsibilities, but it will also introduce a number of transient challenges that will be dealt with in an orderly and collaborative manner with our regulator to ensure the continued wellbeing of our capital markets. Ultimately we are confident that the full implementation of this initiative will open the door to a number of capital market development opportunities. As part of this initiative, for example, the Saudi Stock Exchange will assume jurisdiction for setting listing conditions for all types of securities. Currently all listing requirements are determined by the CMA, and are prescribed within the provisions of its Listing Rules. The migration of these incubated responsibilities to the Saudi Stock Exchange will allow us to work more actively with our regulator to consider further optimizations to our capital markets, primary amongst which would be the possible adoption of a tiered stock market structure, allowing a separate SME market to be born with its own listing conditions and, potentially, its own trading rules. Stimulating SMEs has been a major topic of discussion in Saudi Arabia over the last few years, with a broad range of policymakers weighing in to influence the viability and contribution of these enterprises to the creation of a sustainable and compelling economic growth story for the Kingdom. Our role in supporting this important segment of our economy seems quite clear.</p><h4>What will you be doing, in that respect, to protect investors?</h4><p>The Saudi Stock Exchange, by virtue of law, sits as both the national securities exchange and sole securities depository in the Kingdom. As such we are in a very privileged position acting as the exclusive gateway to the Saudi capital markets. As a result of this exclusivity we are not only a commercial entity seeking to grow our business with the aim of generating strong and sustainable financial performance, but we are also a national interest entrusted with tremendous social and economic responsibilities, primary amongst which is upholding the integrity of our capital market and protecting its stakeholders. We will continue to honor this privilege and responsibility by continuously acting with due regard to our corporate socioeconomic obligations, and by empowering our issuers, members, data vendors, and investors with cutting-edge market technologies and a highly liquid and efficient trading platform. We must also require and foster a high degree of disclosure, transparency, and corporate governance amongst our issuers by evolving ourselves into a representative beacon of excellence. It is by these fundamental means that we protect our investors. Ultimately, investors shoulder the burden of the investment decisions they make, while we simply facilitate the provision of the information they need to make that decision, and offer them a highly liquid platform to efficiently act on it. In this spirit, we recently enhanced the quality of the information investors receive by introducing the IFSAH XBRL-based issuer disclosure system. This platform allows issuers to post bi-lingual corporate announcements and financial reports using standardized electronic templates designed to enhance the investment decision-making process, by making it easier for investors to compare financial performance indicators across companies. We also worked closely with the CMA and our members on the recently approved regulatory framework to govern listed companies suffering from significant levels of capital erosion. The framework is scheduled to enter into force in July, 2014, with the primary purpose of ensuring that investors are made fully aware of an issuer's status as a distressed company prior to being able to buy its shares. Going forward, our aim is to adopt progressive and innovative approaches to fostering a knowledge-based investor culture. For example, we are studying different means of stimulating wider and deeper analyst research of our listed companies, perhaps through the introduction of a research funding model to subsidize the efforts of research houses. We are also working on introducing an interactive investor relations platform and call center to enhance the communication of listed companies with their shareholders and the general investing public.</p><div class="quote">“We promote economic diversification by providing companies with an efficient venue for accessing capital."</div><h4>There is a rumor that you are hoping to open the market to FDI. Is there a timeline for that?</h4><p>As far as the Saudi capital markets are concerned, I think that the issue of allowing direct foreign portfolio investments has been discussed and debated at many levels and, ultimately, I believe it is a simple matter of “when" rather than “if" Saudi Arabia enacts policies to allow such investment flows. As a member of the global community, we have implicit harmonization commitments that we must continue to work actively to honor. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that the Saudi Stock Exchange is already positioning itself well for any potential changes to foreign investment policy. Indeed, the IFSAH issuer disclosures system, since its launch in June, 2013, has enabled all of our listed companies to announce their periodic financial results in both English and Arabic. We will continue to lay down the required groundwork to ensure that the Saudi Stock Exchange is ready for this highly anticipated policy shift.</p><h4>How do you think the market will react when that change occurs?</h4><p>I think the market has, to a certain extent, already started to react. The Saudi stock market, over the course of 2013, has grown by around 25% in terms of market capitalization. Over the same period, the Tadawul All Share Index (TASI) has outperformed the MSCI World Index, the Emerging Markets Index, whilst marginally underperforming the Frontier Markets Index. This appreciation has occurred under the backdrop of trading metrics that show a decline of 29% in year-on-year trading values, a 36% decline in volumes traded, and a 31% decline in transactions conducted. Although our liquidity metrics remain relatively robust, from a regional perspective, the statistics nevertheless suggest that investors may be adopting a longer-term investment horizon compared to historical standards, perhaps increasing their exposure to prime issuers in preemption of the entry of foreign investors into the market.</p><h4>Energy and insurance have both been strong segments over 2H2013. Which sectors do you envisage being strong in 2014?</h4><p>I think that both the consumer- and infrastructure-related segments will continue to do well in 2014 in light of the projected growth in the non-oil economy, and continued government infrastructure spending. The healthcare sector is also likely to expand with the potential of further IPOs in this segment.</p><h4>How does the Saudi Stock Exchange promote economic diversification?</h4><p>We promote economic diversification by providing companies with an efficient venue for accessing capital. We augment this operational aspect of our business by conducting various marketing and educational activities. Indeed, the Saudi Stock Exchange has been very active in reaching out to family-owned businesses across the Kingdom with the aim of enhancing awareness about the virtues of becoming a listed company, particularly in areas related to business continuity, corporate governance, inheritance and succession planning. In fact, over the course of the last two years we have conducted three IPO events in three of the key provinces in the Kingdom. These events have attracted the attendance of more than 220 family-owned businesses, resulting in more than 70 one-on-one meetings, of which around 50% have culminated in companies seeking further counsel from licensed financial advisors. Ultimately, we are committed to growing the national economy by offering value-added capital raising frameworks for all sectors of our market, with an invigorated focus on SMEs. We believe that the new developments in our ecosystem will provide us with the right tools to achieve this.</p><p>© The Business Year - March 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

Porsche has new products coming, and it is no secret to anyone that we are expanding our product line; hence, we have decided to grow our facilities to better serve our clients. When the number of clients grows, you must expand your facilities and human capital; it is a natural investment. We have a showroom in downtown Beirut and on Corniche El Nahr. Given the economic growth of the Metn region and our need to reach out to our customers, we decided to open another branch outside of Beirut. Our objective is to create a Porsche hub for our clients and enthusiasts. I believe this is a big step for Porsche in Lebanon; our facility is now open and is experiencing huge success.</p><h4>How many cars did you sell 2012, and what are you expecting for 2013?</h4><p>In 2012, we delivered around 300 cars in Lebanon. Due to the high perception of the Lebanese consumer regarding sports cars, we have a high ratio of sports cars sold over four-door sedans, such as SUVs like the Cayenne or four-door Panamera. In the region, because the Lebanese consumer is very educated, aware, and trendy, our sales of sports cars are quite high. Moreover, I think Lebanon has a nice road network as well. Although it is not the nicest in the world, you can climb up the mountains on winding roads; you have uphill and downhill stretches, and you can visit beautiful villages where you can enjoy your car in safety.</p><div class="quote">“Lebanese clients are cultivated toward brands, and they know exactly what they want."</div><h4>In terms of the new product lines that you are introducing, what models are you expecting in the short term?</h4><p>For the time being, we have the Panamera. It appeals to many customers that want a sporty car in a four-door sedan, while retaining a Porsche feel in the driving pleasure. We have the Cayenne, which is a very versatile SUVs, as well as the Carrera and all its variants, which range from the Carrera up to the 911 Turbo S. We have both the Cayman, which is a two-door, two-seater coupe, and the Boxster in both versions (Cayman and Cayman S, Boxster and Boxster S). The addition to this product line, as Porsche has already announced, is a smaller version of the SUV, which is due to be launched in early 2Q2014. It will be called the Macan, and is a four-door SUV that is a little bit smaller than the Cayenne. This car is perfect for the Lebanese consumer and the local road network. Being smaller than the Cayenne, it takes up less space and it is a sporty model, despite being an SUV. I think it will reach more clients. We are working toward its launch, and the car itself is wonderful. All we need is a little stability in Lebanon to be able to meet our sales targets.</p><h4>How are Lebanese consumers different from your other clients in the Middle East?</h4><p>First of all, I have to say that the Lebanese client is very demanding. Lebanese clients are cultivated toward brands, and they know exactly what they want. When a client comes into the showroom, he knows what he wants and the options available. We find pleasure in configuring a car for a client who already knows what he wants. We closely discuss the specifications with the client to deliver the perfect product according to their wishes.</p><h4>What is your view on the tax levels for luxury cars in Lebanon?</h4><p>The cheapest place on the planet to buy a car is the GCC region. The custom duties are very convenient, at just 4%. There is barely anything to be paid in terms of taxes. On the other hand, in Lebanon, the tax structure is quite high. Around the year 2000, the government reduced it to 50% on high-end cars. As a result, the tax structure is as such: the buyer incurs 50% taxes, 10% VAT, and around another 6.5% for road tax and registration fees, which means that the price is not aligned with the GCC market. Because Lebanese people have businesses in GCC countries, and there is a lot of human talent in the GCC, they travel around Lebanon and every time they come here, they complain of how the prices in Dubai and Saudi Arabia are much cheaper. We hope that there will come a day when our taxes are aligned with the GCC. This would be an opportunity for us because it would definitely increase our sales.</p><h4>Despite the high taxes, you are still selling and growing. What is driving this growth?</h4><p>Today, the economy is stagnant, but we sell cars because we have excellent products in addition to the service we provide to our clients. In times of limited sales, the competition becomes tougher, and we need to keep our clients satisfied. In addition to this, a lot of our business revolves around Lebanese expatriates or those with businesses beyond the country who like to have a car in Lebanon.</p><h4>What sales target are you aiming for in 2013?</h4><p>I anticipate around 15% more sales than in 2012, and the introduction of new models will help achieve this. We also have the Turbo S and the 911GT3, which are arriving in October 2013, and the face-lifted Panamera launched in August. Because they are newly introduced models, there will be an appetite for them, and this will help us achieve our targets.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the luxury car segment in the medium term?</h4><p>We are bound to grow. The whole luxury industry around the world is booming, especially due to the growth of emerging markets like China and India. When you have notable demand, the manufacturers sell more, develop new products, and invest in R&amp;D. And so they give us better products to sell. The problem is that, again, in our part of the world, the market is split between very low-end and very high-end products. This happens in countries that face economic instability. The trend is currently toward low-end models. That is why in Lebanon we see many cars being sold in that segment, and a lot of competition in terms of the financing and insurance of such models.</p><h4>What role does pre-owned cars sales play in your operations?</h4><p>The pre-owned cars sector is a very important business model. When we introduced pre-owned cars as a separate profit center in 2006, we thought that we needed to give the pre-owned customer the same experience that we give to a new car customer. We have created a showroom that is fully decorated as per Porsche CI, with specialized sellers, and we have introduced programs like extended warranties for pre-owned cars. Customers who want to buy a pre-owned car get the same experience as buying a new car, and enjoy the peace of mind of a warranty. For every two new cars we sell, we sell another 1.2 pre-owned vehicles. Because of the profile of our customers, they tend to take quite good care of their cars. When we give warranties, the car is almost brand new.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Now that the company's headquarters have been re-located to the UAE, how will operations be affected in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>It was my superior's idea to relocate to Jebel Ali two years ago. He called us for a meeting in Mainz-Germany to explain the idea, and I agreed 100%. I believed that being closer to the customer would solve many problems. Being in the Middle East and learning the culture and the environment would generally benefit the company's operations here. In addition, the process time would be reduced and better results could be attained faster than any competitor. We initiated that, and we continue to work on it to be ahead of any competition.</p><h4>How would you characterize the regulatory environment for diagnostics in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>In Saudi Arabia, and especially in the medical sector, business has been growing very rapidly. The Royal Crown has set rules to empower a Saudi Arabian version of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Saudi Food &amp; Drug Authority (SFDA) is the same. It is very strict and sharp, reporting results directly to the Crown. While I believe that it was a good idea, the first implementation lacked some awareness of the new rules and regulations.</p><div class="quote">“In Saudi Arabia, and especially in the medical sector, business has been growing very rapidly."</div><h4>Is Roche going to be involved in the King Abdullah Medical Center project?</h4><p>In my position as Head of Diagnostics, I was involved in every Ministry of Health laboratory. The project involved 2,000 polyclinics, from which we received a significant share. We are supplying more than half of the Ministry of Health sites in Saudi Arabia. With our unique instruments and services, we have secured complete customer satisfaction, with many people praising our work. However, the competition is there and it is very strong. Unfortunately, not every company shares the same commitment to better quality for patients in the Kingdom. We continue to try our best to be the partner of choice for in-vitro diagnostics, and to deliver the basis for better medical decisions at the government, Ministry of Health, and private level.</p><h4>In which lines of business do you see the most growth?</h4><p>In all sectors, our figures are growing rapidly. This indicates that our healthcare sector is greatly improving in the country. There is a trend toward the automation of laboratories, which again is a positive development aimed at improving the quality and consistency of healthcare.</p><h4>How is Roche positioned to capitalize on the healthcare boom in the GCC?</h4><p>Roche is uniquely positioned as being not only the world market leader in in-vitro diagnostics, but as well offers the broadest portfolio of solutions. Roche is among the top-10 companies in the world when it comes to spending in innovation, and everything we do is driven by our aim to deliver what patients need. In the Middle East in particular, we are the only global diagnostics company that has established its own affiliate in the region. We take all decisions locally, close to our customers in the GCC. We have our scientifically trained marketing personnel available to support our team anytime; we maintain a stock of reagents and instruments for the entire region in the UAE, so that we can ensure product quality and availability. Our Customer Support Center takes calls from our end-customers to help them with expert knowledge to directly answer their technical and application requests. All together, we maintain the largest customer support organization in the Middle East in our industry.</p><h4>What role do women play in Roche in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>Roche has a new office and the company has developed an entire department for female Saudi employees. We currently have a private office for eight women who are not salespeople or field service engineers, but medical technologists that are knowledgeable about Roche products. They can work in areas such as technical support, workflow solutions, and the training center. Now, female Roche employees can take part in our organization, and the Roche target is to achieve a 10% total head count, as part of our Saudization efforts. Roche premises in Saudi Arabia have fulfilled the requirement to provide all female employees with the privacy of their own entrance and washroom. Before the end of 2013, Roche hired the first woman to join the Roche team in Saudi Arabia, and we aim to hire more women for our team. Currently, we are interviewing to see who has the right degree in medical devices or applied sciences to meet the requirements for working with us.</p><h4>Are people traveling from other regions into Saudi Arabia for medical tourism?</h4><p>Medical tourism here is limited. However, in Saudi Arabia there is an offer mandated by the Royal King to separate conjoined twins free of charge, which is carried out free of charge for countries all across the globe. Any conjoined twins can be separated in Saudi Arabia. The process generally costs millions of dollars, and is extremely complicated. In fact, very poor people who cannot afford treatment for complicated diseases are also often personally invited by the royal family to be treated in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Looking ahead toward the coming two years, what are your targets, and how do you plan to achieve them?</h4><p>We want to become the trusted partner of choice for in-vitro diagnostics throughout the region. We have achieved this with many important healthcare providers, such as the King Faisal Hospital, military hospitals, the Ministry of Health, Sheikh Khalifa Medical City in Abu Dhabi, and the Sulaiman Al Habib Medical Group. But there are a lot of new projects coming up in Saudi Arabia, and we want to ensure that more facilities use us as the provider of high-quality diagnostics to ensure better medical decisions for patients in the Kingdom.</p><h4>What advice would you offer to future generation of medical specialists?</h4><p>If you know what you want to do, there is no advice I can give other than follow that dream. For me, I had no intention of being involved in business or in the private sector. However, the job I am doing now is more related to the technology, and I gave a recent presentation to high-level doctors on molecular trends. To talk to someone in my position 20 years ago, I would simply tell them to know what field they want to join and decide what they want to be, not the other way around.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[More Than Trade]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[more-than-trade]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state of relations between the EU and the Andean Community, particularly Colombia and Ecuador?</h4><p>The relationship has changed over the years. When I came here about 30 years ago, Colombia had mainly a relationship of development cooperation with most EU countries. In the 1990s, the EU opened a delegation in Colombia that was almost exclusively focused on development cooperation. Gradually, the competencies of the EU have been broadened and relations with Colombia diversified. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, the role of the EU Delegations has been further expanded. Today our main tasks, apart from cooperation, are also political and trade relations. In the meantime, traditional development cooperation is shifting to other types of cooperation, better adapted to the interests of middle-income countries such as Colombia. By 2020 development cooperation will be phasing out, and cooperation in science and technology, higher education, trade, and others will have been strengthened. Colombia is already an upper middle-income country that itself provides cooperation to other countries. Our task now is to evolve in our relationship and transmit the values in the EU's main areas of competence, particularly in foreign relations and security policy. Thanks to our trade agreement, our relationship is also evolving into a bilateral relationship between equal partners, where we enjoy the same rights and are bound by the same obligations. Previously, Colombia had unilateral access to the EU market, where the EU defined the preferential access conditions for which Colombia had to comply with certain conditions. Our trade agreement is a multi-party agreement that covers both Colombia and Peru. As for Ecuador, it stepped out of negotiations for reasons of internal politics. Its government has already expressed, however, the wish to restart the negotiations process. Overall, our relationships with Latin American countries are very good. In some third countries, the EU member states are more prominent than in others as they are historically and culturally more related, such as Portugal, Spain, and Italy. Nowadays, we see that countries like Poland, Austria, Finland, the Czech Republic, and others also want to have a foothold in Colombia and become more active. That is a very positive development, and it also diversifies relations within the EU.</p><h4>How significant is the Erasmus Mundi program?</h4><p>Erasmus Mundi covers countries outside of the EU. It is quite specific in that it enhances exchange between students. Also, a number of European countries, such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain, have their own bilateral scholarship programs. Beyond that, there are a large number of regional programs as well, both in the Andean Community and in Latin America as a whole. Many European and Latin American universities in Colombia develop programs together, covering various areas: innovation, research, and teaching. There is much inter-university cooperation, far more than we are even aware of, considering many programs are organized without the EU Delegation's involvement or assistance. Many universities in Europe find their way whilst looking for funding. Colombia is involved in many programs both in fundamental and applied research.</p><div class="quote">“We are very active and have a strategy that is compulsorily shared by all our member states."</div><h4>What is your vision of the future trade relationship between the EU and Colombia, and also the Andean Community overall?</h4><p>Our trade agreement consists of a multi-party agreement that was meant to be a region-to-region association agreement, therefore including the whole Andean Community; however, Ecuador and Bolivia opted out during the negotiation phase. The final text of the agreement allows for Ecuador and Bolivia to join when they feel ready. Ecuador recently expressed the desire to resume negotiations with the EU. Bolivia has also shown renewed interest. I am convinced that, through such an agreement, our relationship will be strengthened as mentioned before. The aim of the trade agreement is not only to open up our markets, but also to get to know our products and our culture, and to attract investments from Europe to Colombia as well as the other way around. Colombia is a very large country with great potential and there is still a lot still to do in areas where Europe can contribute, such as infrastructure development. Our trade agreement is different from normal free trade agreements (FTAs) in that it includes an essential clause dealing with the respect of human rights, as well as clear objectives regarding labor rights and sustainable development. These commitments are very important for the EU, and we are very strict requesting our own companies to respect them when they invest abroad. We expect that through our commercial exchanges there will be a kind of positive “contamination effect" resulting from these investments. In order to ensure an effective monitoring of these commitments, the necessary mechanisms will be established within the first year of the agreement's implementation, including a sub-committee with government representatives from both sides and a public forum for the participation of civil society.</p><h4>What do you think are the particularities of the Colombian market and the Andean Community in general in terms of attracting foreign investment?</h4><p>Political differences exist, as we know; furthermore, legislation in Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Colombia is different. Colombia has a trade-oriented policy and business-friendly environment, having signed trade agreements with a large number of countries. It is definitely looking beyond its borders and also beyond its traditional partners, namely the US and the EU. Colombians are enthusiastic, disciplined, and highly educated. One of the main challenges for Colombia to compete in a globalized world is modernizing its infrastructure, not just in terms of roads, trains, ports, and airports, but also in regard to logistics: storage facilities and equipment, and cold storage for goods. For services there seems to be less of a problem. Tourism may be hampered by difficulties in transport. Overall, I think both have a lot of potential to attract investment and intensify the relationship. Another challenge is language; people need to be bilingual, or even trilingual. I often remind young people of the option of not necessarily learning English, but possibly to consider a less straightforward choice for languages like Hungarian or Polish, because that way they would have a considerable competitive advantage and create more of a niche for employment for themselves.</p><h4>What role is the EU taking in promoting the defense and respect of human rights in Colombia, be it labor rights, minority rights, or women's rights?</h4><p>We are very active and have a strategy that is compulsorily shared by all our member states. We have regular meetings with government and civil society, and participate in different platforms that they organize. The Colombians are very open to discussing human rights, especially under the current government. They discuss the topic openly and address the issues where they are still lagging behind. They openly share their results, both their successes and their failures. We have attended a number of regional mesas, or workshops, where various civil society organizations and public institutions participate, as far as one can within the existing security environment. This is all very encouraging, but it is important that we continue talking openly about it and promote it. The respect of human rights is one of the EU's “export products." It is something we want and need to promote, and that we strongly believe in. It is hard for some governments to process and deal with the many cases of human rights abuse that occur. It can be hard to investigate each case effectively, and it can be difficult politically, financially, and also logistically, especially in the tense and volatile security environment that Colombia faces. There can also be vested interests that you have to deal with, be it national or regional, economic, or political.</p><h4>A new visa registration system has been created that will affect Colombians traveling to the EU. What changes will this new system bring?</h4><p>The new visa registration system establishes a network between all the visa systems in the Schengen area countries: they will now all be linked. There is a logistical impediment that has to be dealt with which is that new visa applicants now have to present themselves at an embassy to register their fingerprints. Previously the system was more flexible, particularly for travellers to Spain. People could obtain their visas through travel agencies. With the new system, however, once you register your fingerprints they remain in the system for five years. The Schengen countries may become more flexible with visas now that the Visa Information System (VIS) is in place; some countries are showing already more flexibility regarding the validity period of the visas they grant. The visa registration system protects the data, so that the fingerprints and names cannot be abused by others; everybody's travel history can be seen only by the authorized authorities. Frequent and bona fide travellers will be able to travel without major hindrance.</p><p>© The Business Year - April 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[deep-impact]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2013, the IFC tripled its average annual investments in Mexico. What factors prompted this increase in project funding?</h4><p>Before 2013, our average of new investments was between $250 million and $300 million a year. To some extent, the year ending in June 2013 was an outlier and was the result of a business plan that we put in place in 2010. It was a strategy of repositioning in the market, aiming for higher impact, and gaining higher relevance in the business community of Mexico. Our approach was two-pronged: on the one side, we wanted to increase the percentage of our portfolio in Mexico, because Mexico is a large country, with developmental needs, a positive outlook in terms of growth, and is open to external investment, particularly with the reforms lining up. We also wanted to rebalance our investment portfolio, because it was relatively skewed to financial intermediaries, and we wanted to have more investments in the real sector. We started repositioning IFC in the marketplace, looking primarily to sectors of Mexico's greatest competitiveness, and in sectors where there is more content in terms of innovation and employment potential.</p><h4>Which sectors are you focusing on?</h4><p>We came across a study that was done at the end of 2009 by BCG and adapted the results of the study to understand what our best options were for positioning ourselves with respect to what IFC does. We looked at the sectors with comparative competitive advantage and developmental impact. We measured the results in one case vis-í -vis domestic demand, and in the other case via the relationship of the competitiveness of these sectors globally compared to Mexico. For instance, financial services provides a combination of domestic demand and developmental impact that we are looking for as in Mexico private credit penetration is 26% of the GDP, one of the lowest in Latin America. Besides financial services we defined housing, food and beverage, health services, and education as competitive sectors where IFC can play a role. Key sectors that are driven by external markets where Mexico competes globally and have a high developmental impact on the economy include some sectors that we don't yet play a role in, such as steel. Tourism, for example, is important but it is on the boundary. Other sectors we included were health services, business services, information technology, electronic and electrical equipment, industries requiring heavy machinery, and innovative manufacturing. These are the sectors that we are seeing, and in some we were able to increase our presence, while in some other cases it is a work in progress.</p><h4>Why is Mexico important to the IFC investment strategy in Latin America?</h4><p>Mexico is now one of the 10 highest portfolio contributors in the IFC portfolio. However, it was not like that until quite recently, because it was perceived inside the IFC that Mexico did not need the support of the IFC anymore. However, Mexico's income inequality and the economic crisis of 2008 and 2009 hit Mexico severely and increased the levels of poverty, showing that the IFC still had a role in Mexico. Following the crisis, the World Bank very quickly put in place a financial support program, and our reactivation was a little slower because, unlike the World Bank, we are market driven, meaning we go where the market tells us. There are areas where we have played an important role, especially in renewable energy. We have invested a great deal in wind power in Oaxaca. We have European investors as well, and we invested in a solar-electric power plant in Baja California. It is a 30-MW plant and the first merchant solar-power plant, meaning it is an important project.</p><div class="quote">“We measure our impact in terms of the productivity that we inject into a sector by supporting a project."</div><h4>What is the importance of your investment plan in the petrochemical park that Braskem Idesa is building in Veracruz for the petrochemical industry in Mexico, and what are your expectations regarding its impact for the economy of the region?</h4><p>We started working to develop the relationship with Idesa, the Mexican partner of this project, in 2009. After a year and a half of talks, they called us with an offer for a major, challenging project. We realized the project's importance, and agreed to offer support. It has been awarded international recognition and the financial arrangers and backers have been arranged. We believed that the project was important because it was the largest petrochemical project in the country for 25 years. We had committed a relatively large amount of money to it as well, roughly $630 million, or more or less half of our own balance sheet, with the other half coming from external banks. The project is only a kilometer away from the city of Veracruz. The impact on development fields has resulted in manufacturing jobs, plastic production, and various groups have been enticed by the success to move employment back to the area.</p><h4>What other projects do you expect to influence the economy in different areas of the country?</h4><p>The World Bank has different outreach programs based on where you are located in the world. In reality, we are in a higher-middle income country. Normally, the role of the World Bank as a lender to the government decreases over time while the IFC's role increases. It needs to be filtered through some elements of our mission. For example, we do not displace private investors or private banks. If there is a project such as this one, in theory, it can be financed with maturities of 15-17 years. Without multilateral interventions, we do not impose or look for our presence. If there were a role for a catalyst or an absorber of residual risk, then would we play that role. We were interested in Veracruz because the income distribution in Mexico is uneven. There are some islands of wealth that could be a part of developed nations, but there are other areas that are extremely poor. These areas are frontier regions. We try to focus on these frontier regions, but they are resistant to industrial development.</p><h4>Given the IFC's international expertise, in which ways do its investments contribute to the sustainable development of the Mexican economy?</h4><p>We measure our impact in terms of the productivity that we inject into a sector by supporting a project, either through employment generation, supply chain creation, indirect employment, and sustainability that is driven by projects with high standards of environmental, social, and community impact. We have serious measurements in terms of developmental objectives that we monitor yearly so we can justify the impact that we had anticipated when we justified our commitment of investment.</p><h4>What do you do to support SMEs, and what is your role in terms of job creation in Mexico?</h4><p>In Mexico, we believe that we have made a number of important investments, but we could do more. We were with Compartamos and other microfinance organizations. We always need a financial intermediary, because SMEs are not always able to bridge the gap. These financial intermediaries can be commercial banks, which we support by lending operations to specific sectors. We have also supported equity investments in local banks. That is the way we channel our funding into SMEs.</p><h4>How do you feel about the impact of the energy reform on the country?</h4><p>There are some who estimate that the greatest transformative event that could spur the growth of the Mexican economy is the impact of the Energy Reform Plan combined with the National Infrastructure Plan. Energy reform can free up around $25 billion of investment for the private sector in the energy sector alone. The total envelope is around $60 billion. Around half comes from PEMEX and the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). The other half, to double the market, is going to be from private investments. The first estimates of the impact as far as energy reform for employment between 2015 and 2018 will be 500,000 new jobs. Public-private partnerships (PPPs) should add about $8 billion to $10 billion per year. If they only achieve half of what they plan, we are talking about $15 billion to $20 billion in investments, which can easily increase the GDP by 3.5%. In theory, energy reform can spur the economy by as much as 5%.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Sweden has a long-standing relationship with Mozambique. In fact, it started in 1964 when the first President of The Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO), Eduardo Mondlane, visited Sweden requesting support for the Mozambican Institute in Tanzania, the cradle of Mozambican independence. Consequently, in 2014 we celebrate 50 years of cooperation between Swedes and Mozambicans. Sweden has continued to nurture its presence in Mozambique since independence in 1975 in the areas of diplomacy, development cooperation, and trade.</p><p>In October 2013, I had the opportunity to visit Mozambique with a delegation from Sweden, to learn more about our common experience and to contribute to the vibrant continuation of our relations. I was very well received by Prime Minister Dr. Alberto Vaquina and had the opportunity to meet with politicians, business people, academics, and members of civil society, among others. Meeting with Mozambican institutions like the Investment Promotion Centre (CPI), the National Bank of Investment (BNI), and the Institute of Directors (IoD), as well as with representatives from Swedish businesses established in Mozambique, I recognized their enthusiasm for the exciting economic developments that are currently taking place here. I could both see and feel that Mozambique is on the move and undergoing dynamic development.</p><div class="quote">“Sweden has continued to nurture its presence in Mozambique since independence in 1975."</div><p>I observed Mozambique's transformation into a market economy and a multiparty democracy. And while the journey has been impressive, further improvement is still required. I think transparency is a key issue, as corruption is a major obstacle to economic development, not only in Mozambique, but in many other countries, distorting markets and competition. Being a politician myself, I hope and count on the 2014 elections consolidating multiparty democracy and providing ample space for all political parties.</p><p>Clearly then, Mozambique faces many challenges, with a young and growing population that needs education and professional training, as well as quality health services, in order to capture the opportunities of strong economic growth. Through development cooperation, Sweden will continue to work with the government of Mozambique to respond to these challenges. We will also encourage Swedish companies to consider business opportunities in Mozambique.</p><p>Swedish technology from Ericsson is used to develop telecommunications in Mozambique and ABB transformers are being used in both public and private energy projects around the country. Atlas Copco and Sandvik provide machinery and services for the mining industry, whereas Volvo Construction Equipment is used in the construction industry. There is definitely room for more Swedish companies to bring their business to Mozambique. If they respond to the challenges of building their investments on a long-term basis, providing technology and know-how, as well as training young Mozambicans for this new phase of development, I am convinced that they will enjoy success. Swedish-Mozambican trade and business links should be improved in the years to come and I feel very strongly about promoting these, as there are mutual benefits for our two countries.</p><p>Our development cooperation program is significant and covers a number of sectors, channeled mainly through the public sector, but also through the private sector and civil society. Sweden has a rather unique cooperation program with the University of Eduardo Mondlane, which has been ongoing since 1978, resulting in knowledge transfer and research in fields such as agriculture, veterinary science, engineering, and archeology. During the 16 years of war, Sweden was not only one of the major donors of humanitarian aid, but also continued to invest in areas such as education and energy. These are crucial sectors of development for Mozambique and we are pleased that Swedish science and technology, as well as industrial expertise, has been used to accelerate economic growth. We are proud to be longstanding partners with Mozambique, during both good times and bad.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[by-all-means]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the main advantages of being in the Dubai Airport Free Zone?</h4><p>As an international, global company, under the Airbus Group umbrella are Airbus Aircraft, Airbus Helicopters, and Airbus Space and Defense. The first task is to be present and have an industrial footprint where we do business. We employ talented individuals from all over the world, and not only rely on European manpower. We need to be open to joint ventures and to industries being developed in countries where we have our main business activities. Our home companies are in France, Germany, the UK, and Spain, but if we were only present in those four countries and dealing with the world from there, you can image the limitations we would come up against. That is why the decision was taken a long time ago to go international. If we have significant business in the Middle East, we have to have offices as close as possible to those markets. This in turn will generate interest from other countries to engage in industrial endeavors. At that point you can begin to deal with these countries not merely as supplier, but also as partner. Such exchange fosters a climate of loyalty and established relations. In that spirit, and to better coordinate and support our clients, we opened a full subsidiary of Airbus in 2006 covering the Middle East and North Africa region. We handle all aspects of business including marketing, sales, contracts, and customer relations. It also includes all customer service activities such as spare parts, pilot training, and technical support. The customer base now includes over 40 airlines in nearly 30 countries in the region.</p><h4>What is the Airbus strategy for 2014?</h4><p>We now have a backlog of 5,559 units, which is about eight years' worth of production; this is unique in the industry. In 2013 we broke a record in terms of deliveries, achieving a new record of 626 aircraft. We also had a very successful air show, with a total of 160 orders and commitments worth $44 billion. Overall, 2013 was an excellent year. It will be difficult in 2014 to reach the same heights, because when a company orders 100 aircraft one year, it can't repeat the order the following year. However, there will be more orders and I am convinced that we are going to sell more aircraft than we produce per year. In 2013, we sold around 1,619 units and this year we aim to do better. This year will be significant with the entry into service of the A350 XWB and the first flight of the A320neo, which has developed and proven to be very successful, with over 2,600 units sold since its launch.</p><div class="quote">“The Al Maktoum International Airport, in parallel with World Expo 2020, will be excellent for the Emirates."</div><h4>How will the Al Maktoum International Airport help your business?</h4><p>The Al Maktoum International Airport, in parallel with World Expo 2020, will be excellent for the Emirates. First of all, the World Expo will arrive in 2020 and Dubai must gear up to get ready for the massive amount of tourists attending. Therefore, the airport has to be ready. This is a tight deadline and Al Maktoum needs to shoulder its part of the burden. Al Maktoum will act as a magnet for greater traffic and business, and will in turn demand additional aircraft. UAE carriers will most probably review their plans according to the Al Maktoum airport and World Expo 2020, but this will not materialize immediately—it is still six years away but since our delivery is premium and we have a backlog of eight years, some of the orders must take place in 2014 or 2015. Unfortunately, I don't think Al Maktoum will be fully complete by 2020 given its huge scale. Therefore, it will live in parallel with the existing airport. For a while, we will see two airports bring traffic to Dubai, which will be one of the top two hubs in the world based on the number of passengers transiting through the two airports. Then, Al Maktoum will generate an additional requirement for capacity over the coming year or two. Companies have to order now to receive delivery by 2020.</p><h4>What solutions is Airbus bringing to Al Maktoum International Airport?</h4><p>We have subsidiary called ProSky, which is dedicated to the development and support of modern air traffic management (ATM) systems globally. The goal is to achieve the highest operational efficiencies with more direct routings, resulting in around 10% less aircraft fuel consumption and significant reductions in CO2 and noise emissions. Airbus is interacting with, and helping to develop, ATM programs such as Single European Sky ATM Research (SESAR) in Europe, and NextGen in the US. A major Airbus ProSky goal is to accelerate the implementation of both systems and link them together to capitalize on technological and operational synergies. The number of aircraft to be absorbed in the region will depend on Al Maktoum International Airport and also on the restructuring. This will be our challenge for the next five years, and we are here to help them by all means through all of our companies.</p><h4>What kinds of partnerships are you planning for 2014?</h4><p>We'll be focusing on the A320neo and A350 XWB, because we believe this to be the aircraft needed in the region. Of course, we will continue with the A380, too. This is obvious—it is our iconic product, and we will be pushing it hard. Of course, we still have the A330, too. People thought it would fade away, but in 2013 we sold 77 of them. For an aircraft that is “dying," we are still producing it and people are buying it. It is a miracle. In 2014, we have to deliver our first A380 to Qatar, as well as the first A350 ever in the world. This is the first delivery, and it is to be made to Qatar in 2014.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[positive-boom]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the current growth of the construction and real estate sectors in Colombia?</h4><p>We have to differentiate between segments of the construction sector. For example, the housing segment is clearly experiencing a very positive boom in all echelons of society, especially in Colombia's so called “strata" 5 and 6, where prices are growing very rapidly. Strata 4, meaning the middle class, is a segment in full swing and still establishing itself as a key social player of significance to the housing market. Regarding the lower strata, government-led programs are also driving housing market development. Meanwhile, the situation in the office, industrial, and logistics segments is essentially the same; the construction of infrastructure and new units in these segments is currently seeing excellent growth. For example, the stock of office space in Bogotá—1.6 million sqm—is twice what it was back in 2008, and we predict that it will grow by more than 50% in the next five years, reaching 2.5 million sqm. All in all, we can attribute this to Colombia being a new market in an emerging economy. The situation described above is the one we are experiencing right now in Medellí­n and Bogotá, while in other cities like Bucaramanga, Cali, and Barranquilla we are observing these trends, too. As per logistics and industrial real estate, Colombia is not an industrial country per se, except Medellí­n and Bogotá, even though the latter is more a traditional logistics and distribution center. Finally, the retail segment is slowly emerging thanks to the increasing participation of Chilean companies.</p><h4>In your opinion, what infrastructure projects does Bogotá require today?</h4><p>I think that in terms of corporate solutions, Bogotá needs office blocks with a single owner, as this structure is almost non-existent here. Multinational companies require an average of 700 sqm of quality office space, and Bogotá cannot meet this demand today because most of the buildings are condo-type properties with many different owners owning smaller office suites. Ideally, these offices should be located in strata 6, as this area represents more than 70% of the city's current quality office stock. Also, I think over the next few years we might see interesting office and business projects moving outside the business center of Bogotá, which should contribute to the development of other outlying areas of the city.</p><div class="quote">“We arrived here in 2000 and ever since have been expanding our operations in the country."</div><h4>What are the needs of other Colombian cities like Cali, Barranquilla, or Medellí­n?</h4><p>Medellí­n is a market that also attracts the commercial offices of multinational companies that in most cases also have operations in Bogota. I would say Medellí­n is an interesting market due to the fact that it is a big city with its own economic engine. And regarding the other two cities, as well as Cartagena, I believe they will benefit from the free trade agreements (FTAs) the country has signed, with special emphasis on the industrial sector. Bogotá and Medellí­n will benefit more from the FTAs from a logistics and distribution point of view. We will start seeing the results of the FTAs during 2014 and 2015, because it takes companies an average of between two and five years from the signing of an agreement to commence operations in the related countries.</p><h4>Is Colombian construction and real estate prone to the emergence of a real estate bubble?</h4><p>I think this is a booming sector in Colombia's economy and that perhaps there is already a real estate bubble today; however, if this exists, it does not reflect what happened in certain European markets like Spain. Perhaps certain cities and segments suffer from a lag in delivering completed infrastructure originating from the pre-sale financing structure that dominates the Colombian market. I also think that Barranquilla might be experiencing a speculation wave regarding prices of housing units in strata 5 and 6 due to the general belief that the city will become a major economic engine for the country and see massive growth over the coming years. This is certainly boosting sales of housing units by people keen to lease later on when the growth wave hits the city.</p><h4>Which real estate products are most attractive for institutional investors and what opportunities does the construction sector offer in Colombia?</h4><p>Real estate assets here have mostly fragmented ownerships and therefore there are very few assets that can generate appetite from institutional investors. They have to focus on the financing to develop new projects, but local developers are keep financing their projects through pre-sales to smaller investors. This structure offers very few risks, because construction commences only once the property is financed, and never before. This is slowly changing as the pre-sale financing structure for commercial developments is expected to come to an end within the next few years. Institutional and foreign investors will soon get more opportunities on their desks.</p><h4>Since the hospitality sector in Colombia is one of the most attractive in the region, what are your expectations for the development of the Caribbean area of Colombia?</h4><p>Colombia's Caribbean area features Cartagena, Barranquilla, and Santa Marta, an area of 300 kilometers of coast. Cartagena is a very attractive tourism destination with strong maritime port infrastructure, and it has a large industrial and logistics potential. Barranquilla is traditionally an industrial city that has been growing rapidly over the past few years. Barranquilla is the third-most important maritime port in Colombia followed by Santa Marta; the latter is a smaller city and therefore the size of projects are also smaller, with lower expectations for future industrial growth. However, the entire area is also consolidating itself as a very attractive tourism destination.</p><h4>What led to the arrival of Jones Lang LaSalle in Colombia?</h4><p>We arrived here in 2000 and ever since have been expanding our operations in the country. At the moment, we number over 50 employees, when a year ago we were 40. Our future expectations are also highly positive; Colombia has six cities with over 1 million inhabitants and Bogotá accounts for a quarter of national GDP. This is interesting when compared to other cities such as Santiago, Lima, or Buenos Aires, which account for over half of their respective countries' economic output. Colombia is an emerging economy that offers interesting potential, because so much remains to be done.</p><h4>How does Jones Lang LaSalle differentiate itself from its rivals in the industry?</h4><p>When large multinationals like Citibank, Microsoft, or Adidas look to outsource the management of their real estate portfolios, we are one of the only two companies in the world capable of offering them the right solutions. Our focus is on offering worldwide coverage and we are 100% Jones Lang LaSalle, exclusively operating everywhere with our own offices rather than through franchises. Therefore, we have more coherent processes and a more global vision than our competitors.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As a Venezuelan bank, what know-how and expertise are you bringing to the country?</h4><p>Being from Venezuela, we have experienced a political transformation over the past 15 years. One of the good things about transformation is that it opens the eyes of entrepreneurs. We define a good country as one where wealth is distributed. Most people in these countries are surviving thanks to microfinance; however, in most cases the interest rates are 10% per week, sometimes, 1% a day. This creates a very harsh loan environment for ordinary people in the micro world, who are often unable to source sufficient funding for their micro business. In the Dominican Republic, 70% of internal production derives from the micro business, but less than 10% of those people are banked. The banking system therefore is overlooking the bulk of the economy generating most of the national wealth. What we bring from Venezuela is our experience of linking all sides together for better dialog.</p><h4>How do your operations add value for clients?</h4><p>We wanted to make a tangible impact in the micro business. Although some banks had announced providing micro business loans, because of their large size the structure was highly complicated. If you come to us for a loan of Ps2,000 ($50), you do not want to wait two weeks for that to be approved. If you came to us for an even higher loan of Ps8,000 to repair your taxi, for example, you would not want to wait for a week because your car being parked means lost revenue. The large banks have those problems because they are not flexible enough to understand the dynamic turnaround times of micro business. We, on the other hand, issue credit on the spot.</p><div class="quote">“70% of internal production derives from the micro business, but less than 10% of those people are banked."</div><h4>How do you approach your potential clients, both geographically and in terms of services?</h4><p>The regular form of doing business is to open branches, but branches have overheads. To cover the cost, you have to create certain businesses that will enable you to meet those costs. Therefore, what we do is acquire the efficiency of a network by accessing more than 2,000 “Colmados," or convenience stores, which deliver us to our target community without the expense of dedicated branches. This said, we have been opening a few, as we do also need a visible presence. When we acquired the bank, it had only one branch but now has nine. Hopefully, we will close 2013 with 10 branches.</p><h4>What is the array of products and services that you offer, and how do you think that you can extend your portfolio according to those needs?</h4><p>For insurance companies, their base clients are not consumers, but those that sell the insurance, such as the brokers. Ultimately, very few people call the insurance company; they call the broker. Therefore, insurers arrange new products for brokers to promote and sell. This is what we do in the micro world. We use the agents to sound out the needs of the community. Once I receive information, I try to create a forum for one product to approach and satisfy that need. It is a complete cycle, and a social approach that comes from Venezuela. Not everybody has the same standard of living, or indeed the same perception of what this means. You cannot assess a good standard of living solely in terms of owning consumer electronics, or an air-conditioned home. A good standard of living is having a secure and sustainable lifestyle.</p><h4>What is the significance of your operations with the US?</h4><p>The second most important city of the Dominican Republic, as they say, is New York, which is home to 1.8 million Dominicans. Remittances represent about a $3.8 billion per year, of which 60% comes from New York alone. We are present in New York, but not in the banking form, due to the associated high capital expenditure required, which in any case is not what the Dominican community is looking for. We have tried to pursue the business of transferring funds from New York to the Dominican Republic.</p><h4>With the economy and the main demographics increasing, how will the main drivers in the local banking sector evolve?</h4><p>Something that I have noticed in my three-and-a-half years here is a change in the banking sector. One reason for that change is competition from abroad, which the major players are aware of. This sees the banks competing more aggressively today in response, one result of which is a wider range of products on offer at even lower interest rates.</p><h4>Do you foresee any mergers and acquisitions within the finance sector?</h4><p>Some of the larger banks have already started merging with one another, allowing themselves time to prepare for the competition that comes with more experience and funds, and are aggressive. The banking sector has to reduce the offer. All banks are players, but, globally speaking, they need to focus on the banking offer. With the increasing minimum capital requirements, we will see more and more banks merging or leaving the market. That is one of the events we are preparing for. Today, we are third in our niche, having risen from 17th place in less than three-and-a-half years. We have more than $40 million in assets, which ranks us above most banks engaged in multi-banking. Our paid-in capital is also among the highest and three times the threshold stipulated for the multi-banking universe. Thus, we are steadfastly progressing to the next step, which we will hopefully reach in 2014, namely entering that universe.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe Bakcell's 2013 performance?</h4><p>It was a year of strong performance that greatly exceeded 2012. Some of the major trends that we saw in the marketplace included, in the first half of the year, many business customers deciding they wanted to stay where they were in anticipation of mobile number portability (MNP). As it transpired, that didn't occur, so in the second half of the year we saw a significant uptake of business customers. This confirmed that we have the best network, the best data services, and that we represent a strong brand as a communications and distribution network. We saw a major shift from mobile broadband to mobile internet, whereby a large part of our strategy focused on small screen data. Our research indicates that we are still the market leaders in dongles and in small screen data but, for us, the focus was on moving people onto using the internet on their handsets, rather than laptops. That strategy has paid off significantly for us. We are the only operator in the marketplace to have our own branded handsets, Bakcell smartphones, which has been a successful initiative for us. There are over 60,000 iPhones on our network. We have higher-end customers using more services and engaging with our brand. We have also moved up the value chain in terms of customer value, which has led to an uptake of higher-revenue customers. Many of our packages today are focused on higher-spending customers, although we still provide good value for our regular customers. We re-launched a product called “Klass" under the “New Klass" title during the year, which was a first for this market in terms of bundling voice minutes, SMS, and data capacity. This picked up significantly in terms of monthly sales volumes, and these are monthly recurring customers that are closely engaged with our brand and products. Through our network unification process, we formed a subsidiary into which we placed our radio assets that today operates as a large national network called AzerConnect.</p><h4>Can you talk about your own brand smartphone? What informed the decision to launch this product?</h4><p>It is an Android smartphone of high quality that features a 4.3-inch screen. Our strategy was to move from piling data via dongles onto our network to getting people to use their handsets to access and use the internet. The increasing sales of this terminal proved to be a key element of our 2013 strategy. The Bakcell smartphone was a means of achieving this quickly, and also of leveraging the trust invested in the Bakcell brand, especially in the area of mobile data and internet connectivity. The Sür@ (Bakcell 3G service) brand and the Bakcell brand are well known for providing the best mobile data and mobile internet services. Therefore, combining these with a handset of good quality and high functionality was an obvious step for us. Approximately 45% of the market uses Sür@. The key consideration with smartphones is to get people to use the internet on the go. We have seen a significant rise in the tablet segment in 2013 and are pushing smartphones and bigger screens in 2014, as well as devices that are somewhere between tablets and smartphones. What we see are more people using their phones to access the internet on a more ongoing basis. Dongles tend to be heavily oriented toward YouTube and Skype and similar programs. With handsets the array of uses is much broader.</p><div class="quote">“Manchester United has named us as their number one global partner in the mobile arena."</div><h4>What is Bakcell's interest in mobile applications?</h4><p>We don't own an app store, as there are a number of challenges surrounding them in Azerbaijan. For many, you have to first register a credit card, the penetration of which is low in Azerbaijan. Thus, purchasing an application can be a challenging activity for many customers. Moreover, many applications are in the English language, not even in Russian, and certainly not Azerbaijani. That being said, our partner Manchester United has launched an app globally in five languages, one of which was Azerbaijani. That was an important indication of how important our relationship with the club is to them. Generally, many customers are still at the experimental stage. They are downloading free apps rather than paid-for ones. The challenge, then, is to encourage customers to move to paid apps.</p><h4>What sort of developments did you see in the Azerbaijani telecoms sector in 2013?</h4><p>We saw the trends shift from news and information to entertainment. Compared to the beginning of the year, the latter showed that people were accessing more social media, YouTube, videos, and similar websites. In the past, people limited their internet traffic because it was thought to be expensive. Yet having realized that it doesn't cost that much, it has become an alternative medium of entertainment. This effectively marks the beginning of a cultural shift in this type of market.</p><h4>To what extent have you grown your 3G and 4G networks?</h4><p>We have increased our traffic by more than 100%, and our revenues have grown substantially as a result. I think the number of regular users has increased dramatically and it is that regular usage that counts in terms of changing the nature of how people use their devices. We still believe there is a long way to go in 3G, especially beyond the peninsula. We offer good coverage and its improvement will allow us to access even more customers. We are looking at technology to widen our coverage dramatically compared to the competition. The motive behind the launch of an LTE network is the availability of LTE-enabled devices. For example, Apple does not yet enable iPhones for LTE in Azerbaijan, despite the fact that they are compatible. We will build the LTE system, but it is a focus for somewhere further down the line. First of all we need to monetize our 3G segment.</p><h4>How has your partnership with Manchester United been beneficial?</h4><p>We have the highest brand potential index (BPI) of all three major operators. We have increased our BPI, which is a measure of various elements of the brand, more than our competitors. Manchester United has named us as their number one global partner in the mobile arena. A major challenge for us was to take what was clearly an international brand and make it relevant to people here in Azerbaijan. To do this we provided all-weather football pitches in local neighborhoods with coaches and partnered the local football federation here to provide grassroots training for children in many local neighborhoods. We sponsored these schemes in partnership with Manchester United, which brought football to the fore at the local level in Azerbaijan. We also organized the Manchester United Summer Soccer School in Baku and provided Azerbaijani children a wonderful opportunity. As a result, 32 children were selected via nationwide trials, who were then brought to Baku to attend football schools with professional coaching from Manchester United. One fortunate individual was then invited to train with Manchester United. We signed a five-year partnership with the Association of Football Federations of Azerbaijan (AFFA), and today support football development throughout Azerbaijan, as well as the national team. Having this link with a global brand has lent us recognition and boosted our own brand equity.</p><h4>Can you talk about Bakcell's CSR platform?</h4><p>We have two primary focal points regarding CSR. One is development through sport and the other is helping people become more comfortable and familiar with IT, predominately communications and the internet. To achieve this we work with a number of partners, including Manchester United and its global partner, UNICEF. We seek to leverage the relationships we have as well as pursuing individual projects.</p><h4>What do you expect to be the main events for Bakcell in 2014?</h4><p>I expect MNP to gain momentum throughout the year. It has been long awaited and I think foresee a period of momentum building. In other major developments we are seeing fixed-line broadband providers begin to move back into the market. They created a market opportunity for the mobile providers with their limited offering at the time, whereby we observed stronger growth in fixed line in the latter part of 2013. I in fact expect to see a stronger fixed-line performance this year, which will motivate us to present greater mobility proposition to our customers. Content will begin to play an increasingly important role in the offers that we all need to bring to our customers. We will have to consider more comprehensively the role of media and content in our offer. That is part of the flexibility of the mobile operators that others don't have; we can provide tailored content to much smaller customer groups.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you describe your role in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry?</h4><p>Right now, we are in charge of the accountancy issues of over 4,000 educational institutions and centers within the Antioquia region. We carry out a fully comprehensive and integrated process whereby we provide specialists in economics, communications, and marketing, among other areas. However, we base our entire activity on new technologies. In the beginning, the company used to sell software, and then we started to install networks and offer services. We also have our software production center. We like to call ourselves a shared service center that provides fully integrated solutions to businesses by generating value-added for companies by contributing to the efficiency of the processes. For example, in Antioquia there are 125 municipalities; however, there are many remote places that lack access to locally managed funds and resources. We provide a unique technological platform for over 4,000 educational centers by grouping them together under 480 educational funds, and we provide the required platform for these centers to better administrate and control their activity and development. If each of these centers were to do such activity independently, the costs would sky rocket. We make it possible by simplifying these processes and enabling the region of Antioquia to have better access and more secure data on the economic performance of these centers, among other things.</p><h4>What are the different services you provide to the public and private sector?</h4><p>From our early stages of developing the company, we started providing software solutions and packages to government authorities and institutions. Since then, we have understood the possibilities of that market niche, considering that most of the players have traditionally focused on the private sector. In this context, we understand that we can easily become a strong player if we focus more resources and efforts on providing services to the public sector.</p><div class="quote">“Innovation for us is to see what others do not see and to do things in a different way."</div><h4>What do you think is the potential for BPO in Colombia?</h4><p>I think it hides a unique and very interesting potential, especially in regard to the public sector, which in the last few years has come to enjoy the benefits of such practice when high levels of technology are applied. However, I would say that the currently active players in the market lack the know-how of the needs within the public sector, but we, luckily, have developed such abilities thanks to our long-standing business activity in this field.</p><h4>ADA has been publicly recognized as one of the leading companies in the Colombian IT sector by the Ministry of Trade, Commerce, and Tourism. How have you managed to achieve such a position in the market?</h4><p>This has been possible thanks to continuous efforts from our commercial and engineering teams. Such recognition just proves the current trends within the company; we have grown and over the last few years we have expanded our activity thanks to new market niches and commercial partnerships with international counterparts.</p><h4>ADA is in a partnership with TOTVS, which recently signed an agreement with IBM to consolidate its sales in emerging markets. What is the importance of the Colombian market for these companies?</h4><p>Colombia has shown one of the strongest growth rates in the entire Latin American region. Additionally, Colombia has signed many free trade agreements (FTAs) with the main economic markets worldwide. Also, our country enjoys higher levels of institutionalization than other regional countries; we have one of the largest populations in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico, and our middle class is rapidly developing.</p><h4>What are the main investments lined up for the near future?</h4><p>We have an ongoing project in Antioquia, the Manantiales Technological Park. We bought a couple of slots of 6,000 sqm alongside Quipux, a company specializing in intelligent mobility systems, to open offices and establish a data center in the park; that would enable us to expand our premises with an eight- to 10-story building. Also, we aim to continue supporting e-processes related to the financial field in the region of Antioquia with many of its main municipalities.</p><h4>What is the significance of innovation for ADA?</h4><p>Innovation for us is to see what others do not see and to do things in a different way, more efficiently, securely, and with greater value-added. It is all about thinking outside the box to stand out and help our clients to achieve more with less. For us, it is very important to integrate all the tools and elements technology offers and integrate processes, and to be very critical with our work and performance, since that will enable us to grow and improve our services. These items, along with perseverance, are what can push our company to the next level when it comes to competition and help us differentiate our offering from our competitors.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[me-to-you]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your company developed since it began operating in Kazakhstan in 2005?</h4><p>When I joined DPD in 2009, it was a small company employing no more than 10 people. Over the course of a whole month, we exported just 60,000 tons. Today, in stark contrast, we can transport over 180,000 tons in one day, and have approximately 200 staff. For DPD, it has been an amazing time because the company grew as companies started to look for opportunities to minimize their transportation expenses. Previously, they would pay whatever it cost to use an air transportation company. Then, companies began to calculate costs, and DPD was mostly focused on road transportation, our core product. The most important considerations in logistics are price and transit time. DPD covers the major cities like Astana, Karaganda, and Shymkent, generally within two days, and in fact our service is comparable with air transit time, but far cheaper. We began growing rapidly in terms of the figures, albeit from a small base, growing four fold. In 2013, we grew by 70% in year-on-year terms. Now, the base is large and we are still moving fast.</p><h4>How has your transport network expanded over the past few years?</h4><p>In 2009, we had three branches, and the three additional branches we opened in 2013 give us total of 12. The other branches were opened over a period of five years. Today, we have one of the largest office networks in Kazakhstan. The majority of transport companies will tell you they will deliver to any city in Kazakhstan, but they don't have their own offices there, merely partners and connections. We used to operate through partners, but then we saw the risk to quality and reliability, and therefore committed to opening our own offices. We invested in our network in 2011, and within just two months we already felt the results and business started to grow more rapidly.</p><div class="quote">“We are ready to invest significantly in our business as we are customer- rather than bottom-line oriented."</div><h4>DPD's extensive investment in its network has clearly paid dividends for the company. What else contributed to the company's success?</h4><p>It is significant to stress here that our direct competitors send a truck from Almaty to Astana, for example, and tell their customers that they will deliver their package, but are unable to say what day it will arrive as they first wait until the truck is full. It may take a day or even three days to leave. We do not use this model, and instead tell the customer the exact transit time. It doesn't matter whether this truck is full or not, it will still leave Almaty. This is the most important consideration because more than 60% of our costs as a company are transport related. If you are a private transport company, you never send a half-full truck, as it constitutes lost revenue. Once we committed to invest, the first six years registered a loss. At the same time, we were trying to establish a solid network and good service. And today, customers know that our transit time is the best in comparison to our competitors'. In this manner, for the past two years we have been making profits and creating dividends for our stakeholders.</p><h4>Who are your main clients in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>Our clients are almost 100% engaged in the automotive segment. All of the auto brands deliver their spare parts to Kazakhstan through us. We also have many retail customers, and the main brands at the shops in the major shopping malls are all delivered by our company—sports brands, fashion, shoes, many of the IT companies, and also the main internet shops. We have a number of segments, but do not transport perishables. We focus, rather, on transporting high-value equipment and objects.</p><h4>What benefits does the “My DPD" online service, launched in October 2013, bring to your customers?</h4><p>As a customer, you can now see the history of your shipments online, which makes it like your own tracking service. You can generate all kinds of reports, such as the price per kilo, when and where you sent shipments, and who received them. You can also place orders without calling customer services. We have yet to quantify what the advantage of this is in monetary terms, but we enjoy good customer feedback. In road transportation, no other company does something similar to this. International companies are focused on air transportation, but our exclusive focus on road transportation ensures superlative quality service that our competitors cannot match. I think that more than 50% of our customers are international, and in revenue terms, more than 80% derives from international business.</p><h4>What are the strengths and challenges of the transportation sector in Kazakhstan?</h4><p>The strength is that if you have consistency in terms of your assets, you can cover the majority of the major cities, weather permitting, in one or two days. However, there are issues regarding the conditions of roads. This is a particular issue in the Caspian region, where parts of the road network are closed during heavy rain or snow.</p><h4>What impact will the Western Europe-Western China expressway have on the transportation sector?</h4><p>It will have a great impact, as we are already observing positive developments. Kazakhstan will for sure play a larger role in the region. The Silk Road ran through here, and as we are located between China, Russia, and Europe we need efficient infrastructure to continue this legacy. The Customs Union between Russia and Kazakhstan today allows Russian customers to clear their goods in Kazakhstan and then transport to Russia without a border stop. In the future, our location will bring many benefits to our country.</p><h4>How does DPD differentiate itself from its competitors?</h4><p>We are ready to invest significantly in our business as we are customer- rather than bottom-line oriented, and are working today with an eye to the future. Even now that we are a profitable concern, business and logistics are moving from B2B to B2C. E-commerce is developing remarkably fast. We are also flexible and have moved into B2C, which is a completely different business. When it started, this business line was not profitable for us. Yet having started this business on January 1, 2013, it turned a profit after three months. Now we are close to becoming the number one in terms of e-commerce, and are servicing the largest international brands in Kazakhstan.</p><h4>How do envisage your future development?</h4><p>Our 2014 plan has budgeted for growth of over 40%, which is optimistic, but realistic. This year just 2% of our revenue stemmed from B2C, but for 2014 we have budgeted for a rate of 15%. We have forecast 2% growth in profitability of this segment, as it is a low profit business, although in terms of volume, it already accounts for 20% of our business activity. Previously, the average weight of our parcels was around 200 kg, but when we started to migrate to B2C, the average weight started to decrease dramatically. Next year, we are thinking that it will account for more than 45% in volume terms.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What were the highlights and milestones for Efes in 2013</h4><p>Overall, 2013 was an unusual year for the beer industry, and also for other beverages as well because we practically did not have a summer in Kazakhstan. The summer months represent our core business, and the overall industry was negatively affected by the bad weather conditions. We still did well in 2013 compared to the overall industry. Our estimations suggest that the industry will decline by around 5% in 2013 compared to 2012. We succeeded to remain with same volume as in 2012, which was slightly better than the industry average. However, there were also some positive changes; the market is become more structured and richer in terms of brands. In 2013, almost 30 new brands/products appeared on the market, some of which were ours, while others belonged to our competitors. This was a good development for beer culture in the country, as consumers are becoming more aware of different varieties, tastes, and qualities. There are benefits. The competition structure has also changed. A new player joined the game, which is also good because this is like a pool and whoever contributes to the pool will help the overall beer industry.</p><h4>Efes recently launched Zhigulevskoye unfiltered beer. What are some of the other recent and planned additions to the Efes range?</h4><p>At the beginning of 2013, we integrated our operations with those of SAB Miller in Kazakhstan. This integration was completed at an earlier stage in Russia and Ukraine. It allowed us to start operating with SAB Miller's portfolio in Kazakhstan, which is very rich and contains five important brands and many stock-keeping units (SKUs). Now, our portfolio is much richer. We have 13 brands in total and 64 SKUs—quite a large variety. We launched Zhigulevskoye in the second half of 2012 and it became a success story very quickly. There is an overall trend toward Zhigulevskoye because there is no player in the market that does not have a Zhigulevskoye brand today, which is almost the same for Russia. We can talk about it as if it is its own segment. Unlike other players, our Zhigulevskoye Razlivnoe is upper mainstream, not lower mainstream. First, we launched the lager type, and then we introduced the mild version, which is easier to drink. In summer 2013, we launched an unfiltered version, which was a first for the market. It is unfiltered with a different production style. When the bottle stays still it looks transparent, until you shake it. Consumers get the real taste when they shake the bottle as they pour the beer into a glass. This is a totally new product for Kazakhstan. Recently, we launched Kruzhka Svezhego Mild in a 250 ml bottle. It is very unique with the slogan “immediate refreshment," because you can consume it whenever and wherever you want since it is just several sips. Our goal is to create new consumption occasions, to move away from the idea that beer should be drunk in specific place. This is a new category. At first, we were expecting mostly younger consumers to be interested in this product; however, the overall demand is surprisingly quite wide. It has only been in the market for a short time, but has given us some very promising results already.</p><div class="quote">“The taxation on alcohol should not be made on the volume of product, but on the alcohol content of the product."</div><h4>What were the best-selling beers in 2013?</h4><p>Bely Medved is still the top selling beer in our portfolio; it represents almost 20% of the Kazakhstan market, followed by Kruzhka Svezhego, another one of our strong brands. It is the second largest brand in the market. Then comes Karagandinskoe, our local brand from Karaganda. Zhigulevskoye's performance is also quite high. We have already reached almost a 5% market share with Zhigulevskoye in just one year, which is a fantastic result.</p><h4>What trends have you noticed in the alcoholic beverages market?</h4><p>One trend we have noticed is upsizing. Consumers are paying more attention to larger package sizes. We have launched two brands in a one-liter bottle, Karaganda and Zhigulevskoye, with very successful results. It is very convenient and has sharing possibilities. That gives an advantage, especially for home consumption. We have also launched a smaller bottle, which serves more immediate consumption needs. Mild beer, alcohol-wise, is also becoming much more popular. It now represents more than 10% of the market.</p><h4>Efes is very active in regards to corporate social responsibility (CSR). How is the company working toward this goal?</h4><p>Over 2013, we have started many projects that I am proud of. Saving the golden eagles was a highlight, and we continue to work toward this goal. We are collaborating with a state organization protecting eagles in Kazakhstan because it is considered the national symbol of the country. Another thing that made us very proud is receiving the Golden Heart Award, which is given to people or organizations that make significant investments in charity or show great social responsibility. Also, we are now very much focused on responsible consumption, and we have launched several projects in this regard. We have organized a team informing sales points about underage sales in Kazakhstan (under 21 years). We are voluntarily informing our clients to respect the regulations. Secondly, in 2013 we started an excellent project by signing agreements with some Horeca outlets to provide sober drivers for Efes drinkers. If you went out drinking and have a car, Efes Kazakhstan pays for a driver; it is a service that is very appreciated. We also have distributed small devices with which you can check your own alcohol level. It shows if you are already over the drunk driving limit. In some outlets, we have installed larger, more sophisticated devices so you can check the alcohol rate yourself. In Karaganda, we have started numerous projects with the local administration to help society. There was a so-called “Babushka Pazaar," where old women sold homegrown vegetables on the streets. Together with the city administration we have created a covered bazaar with stands so they have a place to sit and are protected from the rain and sun. We will continue such projects also in the future.</p><h4>The government has noted that it intends to increase the excise tax on alcohol, initially regarding hard liquor, with low alcohol products to be considered in 2014. What is your view of this move and of government regulation of the market in general?</h4><p>At the moment, we know that the tax on beer will not increase in 2014. The taxation on alcohol should not be made on the volume of product, but on the alcohol content of the product. That is our argument, and we keep on defending that. It seems that the government thinks and acts in line with this global trend. We know that taxes will increase for products with  alcohol content above 30%, and I think it will create a better consumer choice in the end.</p><h4>Efes' goal is to double business by 2020. What strategies will the company employ to achieve this goal?</h4><p>We are still keen on achieving that goal, and are ahead of our targets. We still believe that it will happen and it may happen even earlier than 2020. Beside doubling our business, which was the vision in 2010, we also added another ambition: to be the most admired FMCG company in Kazakhstan. That encompasses everything from being an ideal employer to being a trustworthy partner to distributers and consumers. In all of this, we have project groups working on how we can improve our skills, and that obviously has a lot to do with the people of Efes. We have clear investments for training management and attracting new staff, while still engaging with existing employees.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The History of Credit]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-history-of-credit]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Crédito Real evolved since it was established 20 years ago?</h4><p>It all started as an idea to establish a consumer finance company to facilitate the sale of MABE household products to consumers. When we considered the mechanics involved, we decided it would be best to establish a company separate from MABE and finance both the products of MABE and its competitors. We knew that the market was greatly undersupplied, which meant there was a considerable growth opportunity. Some 20 years later, and the market remains underserviced. The business climate has changed notably, however. When we started out in the finance business only 15% of people had a credit history, whereas today the number is closer to 60%. Most of our market's relationship with the banking system is limited to payroll via debit card. This involves a social group that does not earn enough to be able to save; they withdraw 100% of their wages.</p><h4>What makes your company a leader in this sector?</h4><p>We have always had competitors, but our direct competitors are not commercial banks, but traditional entities. Our key difference is that we've been able to fund ourselves, both in the national and international markets. With this funding we've been able to outgrow the competition, and are able to offer a bigger and better range of products to our customers at their best convenience.</p><div class="quote">“Everybody targeting the SME sector is looking for intermediaries that know how to lend to this sector, such as ourselves."</div><h4>What was the significance of listing on the Mexico Stock Exchange in 2012?</h4><p>It was a major accomplishment after 20 years in the market to be able to take the company public, as there are few such companies in Mexico. The sector in which we have long worked is just starting to develop. Our company is really not known by end consumers, even though it's a very large company when you see the numbers.</p><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved over the past three years, and what will your growth strategy focus on going forward?</h4><p>We started our business with durable goods loans, leveraging our synergy with MABE. From there we moved into the payroll loans business in 2004. Then, in 2007, we started providing group loans. From then on our portfolio has been evolving more toward payroll loans because of their maturity. Group loans have a very short maturity of about three months. In contrast, the maturity of durable goods loans is about a year and of payroll loans over three years. Around 57% of our loans are payroll loans and 43% are from the other business lines. Today we are the leaders in the public sector payroll loans business. We want to remain at that level, and I forecast growth of between 15% and 20% per annum. Two years ago we undertook an analysis of used car financing. We focus on the base of the pyramid and look at products that traditional banks have, but that are not doing hugely well at the base. At Crédito Real, we've built expertise in analyzing people and making fast credit decisions at the very low end of the pyramid where people don't have a credit history. We look at traditional products, such as auto financing, but we look at how we can do it differently to access low-income people. We discovered that the competition was not coming from traditional banks, but entities similar to ourselves. The largest contributor to growth over the coming years will definitely come from used car sales and SME loans. These are virgin markets with huge growth potential, and also because of the significant government support programs that will be made available.</p><h4>What is Crédito Real's role in supporting SMEs, and how important are they in terms of national growth?</h4><p>Two years ago we also started financing SMEs, especially the smaller ones. They are established businesses that lack traditional finance. They exist between the informal and formal economies, and as such offer real opportunities. A year ago, when President Peña Nieto took office, he announced many programs to support companies willing to lend money to this sector of the economy. That's when we really concentrated on it. We already work with Nafinsa, and have enjoyed a great relationship for around 15 years. Today, it is seeking to lend more to SMEs in the same way as Bancomext. Everybody targeting the SME sector is looking for intermediaries that know how to lend to this sector, such as ourselves. There are many players already in the market. Banks have had SME-oriented products for many years, and yet there are many niches within SMEs that need to be addressed. We are focusing on the smaller of those that generate revenue of between Ps5 million and Ps50 million a year. You cannot really base a credit assessment on their own financials, which is why we focus on analyzing the owner of the company. If, for example, we are to lend money to a beauty salon, much of its income is in cash, so the only way to know its true financial capacity is to familiarize yourself with the business. We send people to observe the business, whereupon we can better assess what kind of loan we can provide. This is something the banks don't do today. We never wait for people to come to us; we approach customers on the street and directly at their businesses.</p><h4>How do your latest acquisitions fit into your strategy?</h4><p>We've learned with the microcredit business that we're not operators, but are very good at finding them. For example, now that we're going into the SME business we have started conducting a nationwide analysis. We found two or three interesting companies and purchased one last year. This company has existed for more than a decade, but failed to grow because it lacked the financing, only growing its portfolio to Ps600 million. It had the potential to grow to perhaps Ps2 billion. Now we work with that company as a partner, and they continue operating it themselves. What we buy is an exclusivity agreement. Traditional banks were approaching payroll lenders, so the way to retain them was to purchase a stake in their company. We are doing the same with car financing, having just signed an agreement for a used car business in Mexico that has also been in operation for a couple of years. We have been good at identifying people with innovative business models. Our strategy for the future will be the same, namely to look for financing opportunities through people that are interested in non-traditional activities and that are profitable but unable to grow.</p><h4>How do you view the development of the financial sector in the country?</h4><p>We are behind most Latin American countries not only in market participation, but also in technology, scope, and product range, and urgently need to catch up. If financial reform guarantees that collections are made easier, then more institutions would be willing to lend money, thereby growing the sector. We need to see how the reforms materialize. I approve of the proposed reform in general because it appears to be pro-business. Time will reveal its effectiveness, however.</p><h4>How do you think the reform process will impact your operations?</h4><p>We've gone over the whole reform program, and our operations will remain the same. We are in the process of applying to the authorities for a banking license, but we don't want to be a traditional bank. There are a few things in the reform and in the laws that make it easier to operate as a bank in the future. The application process will take between 18 and 24 months. We have sufficient capital to become a bank, but getting a banking license doesn't mean that you need to operate as one. It's useful simply to have the option at some stage to do so.</p><h4>How will government support influence your business?</h4><p>There have always been support programs, but today they are expanding in scope. That's good for us too, since we are not pursuing the same pool of customers as the traditional banks. There's space for everybody. Yet, as the country develops financially, companies like ours will inevitably merge with the banks to benefit from being able to offer the full range of services from high-tier business to the lower end all under one roof. However, I think we are still some years away from that scenario.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The importance of innovation and technology for propelling Turkey's economy forward has been clearly recognized by the current government. What programs or initiatives from the Ministry to increase the country's technological capacity have seen the most success?</h4><p>Our Ministry has determined supporting and improving R&amp;D and innovation activities as its duty and prime field of activity in order to develop the technological capacity of the country. These activities are being supported by the many programs we have implemented. In this context, our Ministry is actively carrying out support programs such as technology development zones (TGB), an industrial thesis program (SAN-TEZ), R&amp;D centers, a techno-entrepreneurship capital support program, and other support programs aimed at increasing visibility and encouraging marketing. Our Ministry not only provides infrastructure support for TGBs, which are established within or nearby universities as a platform-hosting collaboration between the university and industry, but also provides support and exemptions for the companies, entrepreneurs, and academics operating within the TGBs. A project contract is signed between the Ministry and the companies that carry out projects within the scope of the SAN-TEZ, which is implemented with the aim of institutionalizing public sector-industry-university collaboration and increasing R&amp;D performance in the country in case the project is considered eligible for support by the Evaluation Committee. While projects are supported within the scope of the program at a rate of 75%, the cost of the remainder is covered by the enterprises themselves. Enterprises that perform R&amp;D activities within the country carry out their innovation programs with a defined subject, duration, budget, and personnel requirements and employ at least 50 R&amp;D personnel, becoming certified as R&amp;D centers by the Evaluation Committee. These enterprises also benefit from the incentives and exemptions stated in the law. We have launched the techno-entrepreneurship capital support program in order to transform the business-related and technology- and innovation-oriented ideas of qualified young people into enterprises that create value-added and have the potential to create qualified employment, thus stimulating the culture of entrepreneurship. We grant a maximum TL100,000 a year to the entrepreneurs considered to be worthy of gaining support within the scope of Law No 5746. We also provide support for local enterprises in our country within the Technological Product Advertisement and Marketing Program in order to introduce and market the technological products that are developed as the result of R&amp;D activities.</p><h4>How would you assess your current position in the country's ongoing e-transformation process, and what are the main obstacles that Turkey must still overcome?</h4><p>An e-transformation generally enables information and communication technologies to be used more intensively in the exchange of information, services, and goods between public institutions and organizations and individuals and enterprises, while providing faster, more productive, and cost-efficient works and transactions. For a successful implementation of the e-transformation process, it is important to collect all public data in a single center.</p><div class="quote">“Our Ministry has determined supporting and improving R&amp;D and innovation activities as its duty and prime field of activity."</div><h4>As Turkey's energy demand grows, what role will technological advancements play in increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of the country's energy generation and distribution matrices?</h4><p>Due to its geopolitical position and scientific, technological, and industrial development potential, as well as its fast growth and growing population, our country will have to increase its energy supply. It is crucial that the country's energy investments take the lead in meeting the energy demands of the market and of households. Considering the share of energy costs in our country's current account deficit, its importance in industrial production, and its role in global conjuncture, energy efficiency is the most significant actor in this field, along with diversification, localization, and cost reduction. It is crucial to make energy savings and ensure energy efficiency in all fields, from primary energy supply to consumption, in order to be able to be globally competitive. The role of technology in energy savings cannot be ignored, and the latest technological improvements ensure the best energy preservation. There are several measures being taken in order to ensure energy savings, such as the transfer of electricity distribution and generation lines underground and the use of aluminum cables instead of copper cables. Effective and efficient energy production and consumption should be one of the main goals of our country.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to implement the Smart Cities concept in Turkey?</h4><p>Turkey aims to carry out its development goal of increasing social welfare and increasing its industrial sector to a level at which it can be competitive in the international arena. This paves the way for a considerable increase in energy demand. It is estimated that this tendency will continue to increase in the following years in our country, which aims to become one of the top-10 economies in the world by 2023. It is anticipated that the problems regarding energy production and consumption will decrease through the introduction of advanced technological solutions like smart grids. A smart grid can be defined as a smart electric grid that coordinates the behavior and activities of all stakeholders to ensure more reliable, economic, and safer electric services. Smart grids are integrated systems that provide situation analysis, prevent power cuts through automatic scaling systems, control overloads and fault conditions, and regulate energy consumption and loss. Considering the fact that approximately TL100 billion is clocked on utility meters used by subscribers annually, a great amount of electricity could be saved through the prevention of energy loss. Furthermore, the use of smart grids will catalyze energy production from natural resources such as sun and wind, and decrease the use of environmentally hazardous and extraneous fossil fuels like petrol and natural gas. The First International Istanbul Smart Grid Congress and Exhibition (ICSG 2013) was held by the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology on May 9-10, 2013 in Istanbul with the participation of PM Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in order to introduce the latest developments in smart grid systems in our country and in the international arena and to determine a road map for the period ahead. More than 1,200 local and foreign participants attended the ICSG 2013. Several sessions on smart grids, as well as a comprehensive panel, were held during the two-day congress, while local and foreign companies exhibited their products at the fairground. The Second Istanbul International Smart Grid Congress and Exhibition (ICSG 2014) will be organized at the WOW Hotel Congress and Exhibition Hall in Istanbul on May 8-9, 2014. It is estimated that the event will make a huge contribution to the more rational management of increasing energy demand in the world, as well as related policies and strategies on smart meters, smart facilities, and automation systems. With this event, we intend to create a more effective, powerful, and prestigious Turkey on the global platform by upgrading to a smart meter system in the direction of our country's 2023 strategic vision. There are 36 million electric meters, 23 million water meters, and 10 million gas meters in our country. The Utility Meters Commission (SAYKOM) was established within the body of our Ministry upon the publication of the relevant legislation in the Turkish Official Gazette No. 28,603 dated March 30, 2013. Technical working groups were established within the body of the commission with the participation of the representatives of related public institutions, associations, universities, and importers and exporters. As a phase of upgrading to smart meters in 2014 in accordance with Vision 2023, activities are ongoing in several areas, such as the setting of minimum criteria for electric meters, gas meters, water meters, as well as for communication equipment and criteria for data security and interoperability.</p><h4>In 2013, Turkey saw many international companies establishing or expanding their R&amp;D centers in the country. How would you characterize the level of foreign interest in Turkey as an R&amp;D base?</h4><p>Economic growth and a positive environment has triggered an increase in foreign investment. Many of these investments have been made in the field of R&amp;D. Within the scope of Law No. 5746, companies that carry out R&amp;D activities in the country, employ at least 50 full-time equivalent personnel, and fulfill several other requirements, are certified as R&amp;D centers. These enterprises also utilize other incentives and exemptions. This law also directly aims to attract foreign investment to the country. Around 26 of the 153 currently active R&amp;D centers have foreign origins.</p><h4>How is the Ministry working to reverse the effects of brain drain and increase Turkey's domestic human capital?</h4><p>The political determination of the government concerning the fields of science, technology, and innovation over the last decade has reflected on science and technology indicators, which are also internationally recognized. Legal regulations, along with the support and exemptions that we have recently put into force in the national and public innovation system, have primarily had an impact on the share of R&amp;D expenditures in GDP. This rate, recorded at 0.48% in 2003, has increased to 0.92% as of 2012. The budgets of public institutions and organizations providing R&amp;D and innovation support mechanisms have increased year after year. The budgets of support programs implemented by the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology have also increased day by day, while new support programs have been added to existing programs, particularly with the aim of boosting the commercialization of technological products in order to meet requirements. This increases the amount of R&amp;D expenditures. Also, the Ministry is taking steps to increase the share of the private sector in R&amp;D expenditures and enable the private sector to invest in R&amp;D. Exemptions and incentives provided for R&amp;D centers and technology development zones are the primary elements that foster private sector growth. Our country needs a qualified workforce to increase the industrial profile of low and medium-low technology to such an industrial level whereby these enterprises can produce high value-added products and exports. We need to keep the human resources required to create value in sectors within the high and medium-high technology class and to introduce sustainable success in these fields. This is key to countering the loss of qualified people who went abroad for education in these fields over the past years. Our Ministry has been organizing Target Turkey Workshops for the past four years through the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) in order to bring back scientists to Turkey. There are also Europe-based works in addition to US-based ones. The last Target Turkey Workshop was held in Berlin. Furthermore, Law No. 2232, pertaining to the returning-home research fellowship program, is intended to accelerate the process of reverse brain drain, especially for Turkish citizens who have research experience in the fields of natural sciences, engineering and technology, social and human sciences, medical sciences, and agricultural sciences, and thus enable them to continue their studies in Turkey. Within the scope of this program, researchers are granted a monthly scholarship of TL3,250 for two years and researchers working for universities and units of public R&amp;D units are granted research support up to TL30,000. Hence, all of our efforts have provided the desired results, and 248 researchers have returned to the country while 717 scientists have temporarily studied in Turkey for joint works.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's goals and expectations for 2014?</h4><p>We intend to support well-grounded economics by developing our technology and products in the fields that have significant impact on the foreign trade deficit and by creating an industry that is based on R&amp;D and innovation. We have already embedded the issue of the technological transformation of companies into the policies of the Industrial Strategy. We wish to empower our presence in the world markets with high value-added technologies and competitive trademarks through supporting R&amp;D and innovation. In this direction, we form and support interfaces that will contribute to the development of cooperation and the infrastructure required for innovation, while also intending to enable our society and industrialists, including SMEs and large-scale corporates, to be more innovation orientated. Moreover, we wish to carry out our activities effectively by conducting some studies like impact analysis in order to see to what extent our support programs have reached their goals.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Haji Saeed Lootah, the founder of Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB), in November 2013 received the EFICA Lifetime Achievement Award for his role in developing the Islamic banking sector. How significant is this for DIB?</h4><p>Clearly this is a huge honor for us and a testament to our belief in DIB and the principles that it was founded on way back in 1975. Established as the first fully fledged Islamic bank in the world nearly four decades ago, we are globally acknowledged as pioneers in the field of Islamic finance. This award further emphasizes the seriousness and commitment of the industry leaders of the country to this fast growing sector in the financial industry. The awarding of the bank's founder to me reiterates that industry experts have acknowledged the importance of Islamic finance, the contribution of DIB, and the role of the man himself. We are a cornerstone of the UAE economy, and will continue to use our expertise and financial strength to further the development and progress of this great nation.</p><h4>How does the bank maintain solid customer relations?</h4><p>Our aim is to strengthen and deepen customer relationships while continuously improving the quality of interaction experience across the bank. With this objective at the forefront, we have continuously invested in technology and related infrastructure, ensuring that we deliver high-quality and value-added services to our customers across a multitude of user-friendly touch points, from branches to automated machines, express centers, online platforms, and even mobile devices. We want our customers to know that no matter where they are, we are ready to serve them with the same consistent high-quality experience across all our channels.</p><h4>In your opinion, what is the current state of the Islamic finance industry?</h4><p>Islamic finance is now a clearly established and globally acknowledged phenomenon. The progression over the last four decades, since the inception of DIB, has been massive. Many, including western countries, seriously believe that this sector offers a more plausible alternative to the age-old conventional model of finance. No wonder then that Islamic finance and banking in the UAE has been growing at nearly double the pace of the conventional sector over the last few years. That said, there is still some progress to be made, particularly in the field of innovation around products and offerings. Liquidity management solutions, factoring, and receivables financing including distributor and supplier finance are typical examples of where Islamic finance can play a major role once quality structures are established in these areas. Further tightening of risk management processes and enhancing operational efficiencies will also go a long way in building a long-term and sustainable model. There are roughly 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, which is significant. Meanwhile, the sector boasts assets of around $1.5 trillion. That represents just 1% roughly of the total global market, which means that we have just scratched the tip of the iceberg. However, trend analysis over the past two decades suggests a CAGR of 20%. Now one might argue that the denominator is small, and hence double-digit growth easy to achieve, but clearly there is growth, which is sustainable. Islamic finance, as an industry, proved to be highly resilient and stable during the global financial crisis, which is a major factor in its growing acceptability around the globe.</p><div class="quote">“All banks have weathered the storm quite well, making sure that prudence has a central seat at the table."</div><h4>DIB has signed a partnership with global human resource consultancy Aon Hewitt. How will this partnership improve your staff?</h4><p>While customers are at the center of everything we do, we also realize that investment in human capital is crucial for any organization, and not just ours. And, clearly, a partnership with Aon Hewitt actually allows us to bring best practices to the forefront within the human resource arena. The aim of this alliance is to not just review staff remuneration and compensation, but also to identify best fit and talent to support DIB's strategic agenda over the medium term.</p><h4>What role has the bank played in the overall development of the economy?</h4><p>DIB has been synonymous with the growth of Dubai and the UAE. As we have positioned Islamic finance to be a key component of the financial sector in the country, we engaged with the stakeholders across the market, including the government and using our expertise and heritage, and concluded some of the largest landmark deals in the history of Islamic finance. Some of these included huge debt capital market transactions around fund raising for infrastructure development, airports, ports and shipping, and aviation. That said, we have not forgotten the backbone of the UAE economy, which is trade and built around the large SME segment in the country. Contrary to popular belief, the UAE's business world is actually 85% composed of SMEs. We have established comprehensive solutions for this sector, catering specifically to their liquidity management needs. In addition, we also underpin the broader UAE economy through the supportive financing of national housing loans and the development of large commercial real estate projects.</p><h4>How well protected is the real estate sector following the global financial crisis?</h4><p>We witnessed a degree of instability within the real estate market from about 2008 to 2011. The market, however, has clearly rebounded on the back of its core fundamentals. Moreover, the regulators have taken solid steps toward ensuring there are no repeat bubbles in the future. As a result, the real estate industry is now on a solid and sustainable growth trajectory. Transaction numbers are on the rise as the markets stabilize, and the country is once again attracting investment in this sector. And though new projects are being launched similar to before, the primary demand today is coming from the end user, which is a great sign and will ensure future stability and sustainability.</p><h4>What is the significance of Dubai's successful bid for Expo 2020?</h4><p>EXPO 2020 will attract local and international investment, both financial and intellectual, in the fields of finance, services, infrastructure, transportation and logistics, tourism, hospitality, digital technologies, the media, and energy and alternative energy to name a few, leading to significant innovation in the Emirate. The above will have a domino effect on trade, investment, technology, construction, and other related sectors, not just in Dubai, but in the UAE as a whole. The Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates that the Expo could boost GDP by $23 billion, or 24.4%, over 2015-21. There is also the expectation of new job creation of around 300,000 during the period, particularly in the area of construction, hospitality, transportation, logistics, retail, and services. Dubai's infrastructure will get a further boost, including schools, universities, medical clinics, hospitals, roads, ports, and airports. Finally, the brand value of Dubai is expected to grow by $8 billion to $57 billion, according to Brand Finance.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the development of the financial services sector in the UAE?</h4><p>I think the finance sector within the UAE, thanks to the UAE Central Bank and the authorities, has become highly resilient. All banks have weathered the storm quite well, making sure that prudence has a central seat at the table, along with a strengthening of the risk management framework and surrounding corporate governance and compliance infrastructure. The future now looks very positive as the upbeat nature of the economy foretells, and the banks will be a key beneficiary of this growth momentum. All the banks in the country have weathered the crisis well, thanks to the timely and decisive steps taken by the government and the regulators in early stages, which has put the financial sector on a robust and sound growth platform in this booming economic environment.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been C.A.T. Group's historic role in the contracting sector in the 20th century?</h4><p>The C.A.T. Group, founded in 1937 by Emile Bustani and his partners Abdallah El Khoury and Shukri Shammas, played a significant and proud role in the history of 20th century contracting, experiencing the turmoil of the Middle East, while preserving its culture of excellence. Our group has a spirit and tradition, values its employees, and provides them with the best working environment even in very difficult and unsafe areas. When C.A.T. was established, there were no Lebanese contractors and, in the late 1950s, C.A.T. became the biggest contracting company in the MENA region. We were also the first family business in the Middle East run by professional management, and not by the families or shareholders themselves. The mission of the C.A.T. Group is to offer a wide range of integrated engineering, procurement, and construction services based on up-to-date knowledge, quality assurance, safety, quality workmanship, cost awareness, and on-time delivery. Our group operates in diverse sectors, such as oil and gas, pipeline, mechanical, buildings, civil engineering, and roads.</p><h4>How are C.A.T. Group's international operations developing?</h4><p>After more than 75 years, C.A.T. Group still has an eminent presence in the GCC, the Middle East, and Africa, thanks to its culture of excellence and its commitment to providing the best services to its clients. In Saudi Arabia, we successfully completed important projects in the oil and gas, mechanical, and pipeline sectors and we have an important portfolio of ongoing projects for Aramco, Maaden, and many other clients. Our strong presence in Nigeria allows us to execute significant volumes of civil works, such as roads, highways, bridges, and water plants in many states. Qatar is also an important market for C.A.T. Group since we have completed prestigious projects there, such as one of the world's largest district cooling plants executed on a design and build basis; the Integrated District Cooling Plant (IDCP), which was installed in The Pearl Qatar in 2010 and which will service more than 80 apartment towers, beachfront villas, townhouses, shopping complexes, offices, schools, and hotels throughout the island, ultimately supplying more than 130,000 tons of refrigeration to the island's estimated 50,000 residents in the Porto Arabia project in The Pearl Qatar. We are currently closing on three of the main central utility plants for the New Doha International Airport as well as the Doha Land Infrastructure Works for Msheireb Properties. In the UAE, we are working in the oil and gas, pipelines, and heavy mechanical sectors. We have successfully built several district cooling plants in the UAE. The C.A.T. Group is also active in Kuwait. In addition, our presence in Basra in Iraq allows us to target important projects in the oil and gas and pipeline sectors. Over the past few years, we have also completed a number of noteworthy projects in Lebanon, including the Marina Towers, the An Nahar Building, and the Lebanese Order of Physicians' headquarters.</p><div class="quote">“The construction sector in Lebanon is widely relying on private real estate developments."</div><h4>How do you assess Lebanon's construction sector?</h4><p>Lebanon's construction sector experienced an overall decline of around 11.7 % in 2012 relative to 2011. The construction sector in Lebanon is widely relying on private real estate developments. Public projects in Lebanon are very rare and are put on hold mainly because the government does not have the budget to fund them. The government has made no significant investments in infrastructure, though Lebanon badly needs to improve its infrastructure and build power plants to cover the country's needs in electricity, water treatment, and solid waste management to preserve our environment, which is seriously threatened. It also needs to double sustainable energy projects to reduce the country's dependence on oil and natural gas. In my opinion, cooperation between the public and private sectors can help the government to overcome this impasse. However, without a well-defined and clear legal and financial framework, recognition of shared interests and balanced contract risk allocation, the public-private partnership (PPP) cannot be successful.</p><h4>What has been the focus of your growth strategy in recent years, and where do you see more potential for the company to grow?</h4><p>Although we are living in a politically unstable region where nobody knows what will happen next, as was the case in Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Tunisia, the region still has high potential. Accordingly, we continue to focus on areas of business wherein we already have a presence, and at the same time we are looking to develop our expertise and know-how in others regions, such as Africa and Eastern Europe. The Group's leadership, culture, vision, efficient financial management, risk management, systems and procedures, and high-level skill have always helped our group's businesses achieve their potential.</p><h4>What are C.A.T. Group's competitive advantages?</h4><p>The competitive advantages of the C.A.T. Group results from matching core competencies to the opportunities offered to us. C.A.T. Group has a unique history and a culture that allow us to create an edge over our competitors. C.A.T.'s solid reputation is underpinned by its firm commitment to provide the best services to its clients, based on quality, safety, and timely delivery. We consistently seek to meet or even exceed our clients' expectations, which in turn enable us to establish long-term relationships with them. Our intentional emphasis on quality and transparency keeps us on the right track with subcontractors and suppliers, which we consider on the same level as our real partners. We are also distinguished because we invest in our people, our most valuable assets; we respect and appreciate them.</p><h4>How has C.A.T. Group managed to transfer its success to so many different markets?</h4><p>The secrets of the success of the C.A.T. Group are its culture of excellence and the commitment of its people to deliver, most of the time, in very difficult areas. The C.A.T. culture provides the key by opening up to new markets, which ultimately results in our flexibility from one region to another, supported by unwavering corporate standards, system, and policies. Being deeply rooted, we have the ability to deal with different types of clients, adapting ourselves to their culture, needs, and expectations. Dealing with GCC clients may differ considerably from dealing with Nigerian or other African clients. For example, for some clients, safety is of prime concern, while for others cost may be a more important element. We are also very transparent in the way we share information, and achieve considerable synergy between our departments, divisions, and areas, all of which are very important. Success is gradually built by learning from one's own mistakes.</p><h4>Where do you see the construction sector in Lebanon developing over the next decade, and where do you envision C.A.T. Group?</h4><p>For the construction sector, it is very hard to say and is unpredictable as it does not only depend on the situation in Lebanon, but also in the region as a whole. Without stability, you cannot develop a country, and Lebanon must achieve its stability once and for all and I am optimistic that one day Lebanon will once again fully utilize its ingenuity. As for C.A.T. Group, I am confident that we will continue on the path laid down by its founders Emile Bustani, Abdallah El Khoury, and Shukri Shammas as we are still willing to grow further by opening up new markets, and without a shadow of doubt we are keen on working in Lebanon again. As such, we are targeting some important projects in the construction sector as well as in the oil and gas sector since we are already prequalified to participate in the tenders of the offshore and onshore works. My main objectives as CEO of the C.A.T. Group are to preserve our culture and spirit of excellence, to maintain our leadership position among the major players in the GCC and MENA region, to remain committed to delivering and meeting our clients expectations, to invest in our people and develop their skills, to continue working in a spirit of partnership and maintain transparency, and, last but not least, to enhance the group's financial strength and create wealth for our shareholders.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you been affected in recent years by demand in Oman for construction materials?</h4><p>Geologically, the Sultanate of Oman has a large, advantageous reserve of limestone, which is the main ingredient and raw material in the process of cement manufacturing. The Muscat area is surrounded by mountains and rocks with different types of minerals, especially limestone. Our plant is surrounded mainly by limestone, but also by the other necessary raw materials and additives required for cement production, such as iron, silica, kaolin, and gypsum. These raw materials are all available in Oman, and more than 95% of them are found in this area. This is the main reason why the government decided to construct the cement plant here. Though this area is a little far away from the capital, it will be connected to the city by easily accessible highways. Another advantage is the uninterrupted supply of natural gas from the Ministry of Oil and Gas required for the operation of the plant. This was a very important factor for us when we decided to double the capacity of the plant during 1998 and then again in 2011. The company's total capacity is now 8,000 tons, and there is strong demand in Oman for cement. There are also other manufacturers in the Sultanate like Raysut Cement Company and Al Madina Cement. Raysut Cement Company is larger than Oman Cement Company now after acquiring a cement plant in the UAE. Still, the demand remains larger than the total production of all manufacturers combined, and, therefore, we continue to import cement/clinker from neighboring countries in order to meet local demand. We are working with Raysut Cement Company to develop marketing strategies in other regions of the country. We are also in the process of establishing a new cement factory in the Duqm area in association with Raysut Cement Company, expecting the availability of natural gas by 2017. Also, a consultant has been appointed for a pre-feasibility study for this project.</p><h4>What is your market share within Oman?</h4><p>We occupy around one-third of the market. In export terms, we only export oil well cement, which is the kind used for drilling oil wells. Other than this, our major market is Muscat and its neighboring wilayats. The largest demand in the Sultanate is for ordinary Portland cement. About 20% of the demand is for sulfate-resistant cement, which is usually used for grounding and designed to counter sulfates seeping up from the soil. Another 10% of the demand is for oil well cement, which is being sold both locally and internationally.</p><div class="quote">“We don't see many ups and downs in Oman and there is steady growth in the construction sector."</div><h4>Do you see infrastructure and real estate development continuing to drive the high demand for Oman Cement in the future?</h4><p>We don't see many ups and downs in Oman and there is steady growth in the construction sector, as well as in the private sector. There is a proposed project for a railway network in the Sultanate, and that will necessitate a large quantity of cement for concrete. Hence, the demand will further increase to the point where we're going to need a new production line in Oman. It is a big country with rough terrain that will require a lot of bridges since railways lines cannot be laid through valleys. Because of this, we believe it's the right time to build an additional cement plant to meet local demand. We're also considering modifying our old plants and increasing the existing capacity. As for the location, we believe that any new plant should have a port base, so that we can easily export any surplus, if available. This is where Duqm comes in, and the good thing about Duqm is the availability of limestone reserves just 25-30 kilometers away from the port. Therefore, the plant can be built anywhere between the port and the reserve area, making it easy and inexpensive for raw material transport.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania has a housing deficit of around 3 million units, and that is growing by nearly 200,000 units per year. What steps is the National Housing Corporation (NHC) taking to address this?</h4><p>It is important to appreciate why we have such a deficit today. In 1975, the government stopped subsidizing and supporting the NHC. Inflation was also high, which affected interest rates, and therefore it was expensive for both the NHC and the clients trying to take on obligations. There were also laws in place that favored tenants over landlords, as well as a law that protected borrowers at the expense of lenders. For nearly three and a half decades, there wasn't much progress in the housing sector from the governmental perspective, which meant that the housing developer was left to intervene. In 2010, the government decided to take a bold step, having realized the challenges it was facing in the housing industry. One step the government took, apart from reforming our laws, was to restructure the NHC. I arrived at the institute in 2010 as part of the restructuring to get the NHC back on track as a more efficient institution, operating as efficiently as possible in the private sector. Over a period of three years, the NHC has been left to operate, work, and deliver with very minimal political intervention. We have a reasonably good balance sheet to operate from and deliver on our agenda. We are an institution with a capital base of nearly $1.4 billion, which makes NHC the largest company in East Africa by capital base. In terms of real estate, we are still among the top three largest companies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The NHC has a number of ongoing projects. Firstly, we think our role should not solely be to develop houses; there are other areas where we can help. For instance, we use our position as a government institution to influence policymakers and bring about the right policies, which will encourage lenders, developers, and all players within the sector to work together and deliver more housing. We will do that through a forthcoming R&amp;D association that will help to bring about a common base from which to influence, lobby, and bring about the right policies, the right changes, and the right practices within the industry. The final thing that we have been doing is engaging the financial institutions. So far, we have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with 12 financial institutions and 12 banks that are willing to lend to our clients. We guarantee that when we build houses, our buyers will be financed at affordable rates.</p><h4>What has changed within the NHC since the 2010 restructuring?</h4><p>It was done purely on the government's initiative; we managed the process internally without the help of the IMF or the World Bank. The first step of the restructuring was to scrutinize our environment and vision, whereby we evaluated our entire strategy and to develop a better plan. Secondly, the strategic plan needed the right organizational structure. When we were comfortable that we had devised one, we addressed the most difficult and challenging part of the job, namely finding the right people for the right positions. The institution had been stable for 50 years, having put down strong roots, rendering it rather resistant to change. In a bold move, we replaced 100% of the management team, in pursuit of the right people with the right skills, talent, and motivation to deliver on our agenda. We gave this opportunity to existing candidates and additional people from outside the company; we especially encouraged junior employees to apply. Most importantly for the directors, we ensured that everyone working for them was contracted.</p><div class="quote">“The dream of most people the world over is to own their own home."</div><h4>What do the four new MoUs with major banks achieve for the NHC, and what wider effect will they have on the real estate market?</h4><p>These agreements are critical for us since financing allows people to buy houses. The dream of most people the world over is to own their own home. Because we had been signing with the banks, one of our key criteria was access to long-term loans of a minimum of 15—20 years. Formerly, they had been lending for between eight and 12 years. Tanzania has also recently seen legal reform, which was well received, and not least by the banking community. In the past, banks here actively pursued mortgage lending and were often dragging their feet. In order to entice them we provided an option; those lending to an NHC client were guaranteed a buyback option. Accordingly, in the event of a client defaulting within five years we pledged to repurchase that property. We have also gone one step further by working with an insurance firm acting as a guarantor for the bank, and insuring it for the 20% down payment. Therefore, a client is not required to pay that 20% to the bank, but rather, a small amount of money as a premium. For example, if I sell a house for $100,000, the 20% is $20,000. Now, the client has two options. He can find the $20,000 and deposit it at the bank, or else he can go to the insurance firm, which will then pay the premium. The premium amount will come to maybe $500 or $1,000, which is much more affordable for the client than $20,000. In this manner the bank has been guaranteed, and everything is within the maximum value of the house.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your international experience contributed to your role with ADIB?</h4><p>I worked for Citibank for 25 years before I came to ADIB, and I have worked in nine different countries and 12 cities. My last station was with the Samba Financial Group. At Samba, I was responsible for Islamic banking, while also being the head of wholesale and investment banking. There, I found that there is a window of opportunity in the Islamic banking industry that needs to be developed. The opportunity came and I joined Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank (ADIB) in the first quarter of 2008. Coming into a fully Islamic bank gave me the opportunity to implement the best of both worlds. I wanted to bring efficiency, customer service, and innovation to Islamic banking. There was a study done by McKinsey in 2005 that focused on service levels being an issue in Islamic banks. That is where I got the idea to take the best from both worlds.</p><h4>How was service in the bank when you came here?</h4><p>When I joined ADIB the bank ranked 23rd in customer service in the country; there were only 24 banks ranked in the survey at the time. The number one priority at that time was to enhance our customer service, so we established the goal of becoming the number one bank in the country in those terms. Now, we are number one, and have now been for three years running.</p><div class="quote">“If you are a person who likes to deal with an honest institution, then we are your bank."</div><h4>How was this achieved?</h4><p>It sounds easy to describe, but from an implementation point of view it was challenging. We only managed it because we had everybody in the bank working on it. We created a campaign within the bank, we showed the people what the issues were, what customers felt, and what the external agency we used felt about our service. We showed them the gaps between excellent service and where we were, and then worked from there. We had to change the way we appeared and the way we served customers, including the way we spoke to them. We brought in trainers from the hospitality industry.</p><h4>Was changing the mentality of your employees the most difficult part of this process?</h4><p>We had to focus on their emotional needs and make them understand that this is something important. In our culture, we take enormous pride in generosity and hospitality in our homes. When a guest visits, we get the red carpet out and give them the best. Why not think of the bank as our home? If somebody visits you at the bank, why have a different personality? This approach helped our staff to understand what they were trying to achieve.</p><h4>What kind of response have you received from the many non-Muslims who reside in the UAE?</h4><p>At ADIB, we are positioning ourselves toward the non-Muslim community as a very competitive bank with excellent service. We speak their language and we are highly ethical. It doesn't matter what religion you have, if you are a person who likes to deal with an honest institution, then we are your bank. If you invest with your money, we look after your money, and we have a different concept for dealing with clients with difficulties. We are required, by our charter, to demonstrate tolerance if you have a financial difficulty. If you lose your job and cannot pay an installment on time, we are patient with you until you find employment. In terms of transparency, there are no hidden charges. We promise you zero surprises when you do business with us.</p><h4>Are there any products not offered by ADIB?</h4><p>We don't let you speculate on the stock market using our bank. If you are into speculation we can't help you. These are the things we don't do, but in general we have a full product range. We provide financing for houses, cars, SME requirements, and even education. We have wealth management products, savings schemes, insurance schemes, and we even offer retirement products and retirement savings plans.</p><h4>What is the focus of your international business?</h4><p>We are in seven countries in total, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Sudan, Egypt, and the UK. Our strategy is very simple; we are working to develop a strong presence in the Middle East and North Africa. We need to be seen as a regional bank able to offer a similar package of services as any international bank in the region. We look at key markets where the demographics are right and there is impressive economic activity or potential.</p><h4>Why do you believe that ADIB is the banking partner of choice?</h4><p>For any company that reads this and wants a financial partner in the UAE, there are fantastic opportunities for them to partner with us. We have a presence in the UAE that is very strong in all business segments. We have a strong presence in Qatar, in Iraq, in Sudan, and in Egypt, and we continue to grow. For any company that wants to be in the Middle East or an individual who is wealthy and looking to invest his or her personal wealth here in UAE, we are the right financial partners. We can arrange investments in real estate and in marketable securities and in fixed-income securities. ADIB is a strong financial partner that speaks your language.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the significance of the contract that Shell has with the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) for your operations in the country?</h4><p>The contract supplies LNG into Mexico through the CFE. This contract became operational in 2006 and is part of a joint venture with Total in which Shell holds a 75% stake, with the remaining 25% belonging to Total. Shell's aim is to expand the use of LNG in both industry and transport. Indeed, this is an area where Shell has made significant headway in the US and Canada, and I believe that as this evolves and develops in these aforementioned countries, it will also develop and expand in Mexico. There has now been an historic energy reform law put into place. However, there is still a long road ahead with definitions to be made of secondary laws, how they will be implemented, and what the country's growth model will be. This new law could potentially open up different areas of the Mexican oil and gas industry for companies to participate in and develop the energy sector in the country. It is still early days, but we are hopeful that companies like Shell will help contribute to the growth and development of Mexico's energy sector.</p><h4>How far will these new energy reforms impact your operations in Mexico?</h4><p>I think we have to remain observant. What Mexico has achieved with these reforms is something that has not occurred in the past 75 years; however, we need to understand what the government has in mind for companies in terms of participation, and only then will the major brands and contracts follow. Only then will we see the real impact of the energy reform. Still, we are as committed as we have always been to contributing to the development of the energy sector in Mexico with our expertise, knowledge, and technology. We see ourselves as partnering with Mexico in this phase, just as we have been doing for the past 60 years.</p><div class="quote">“What Mexico has achieved with these reforms is something that has not occurred in the past 75 years."</div><h4>What will your role in the development of Mexico be, considering you have been active here for the past 60 years?</h4><p>It will be similar to how we do things in other countries, where we come in as partners and work together. We are very respectful of the decision made by a country's government. Today, we merely need to step aside and see how Mexico wants to move forward. However, we will also let it be known that we are ready to participate once the right opportunities become available. That is how we work in other countries, too. We enter as partners and problem solvers and try to help countries develop the full potential of their resources. Mexico has huge potential. It is one of the most open economies in the world with a vast internal market and high aspirations, and is also very close to the US. From a geological perspective, Mexico has natural resources that the country can benefit greatly from, although considerable investments are needed for this potential to be realized. Mexico also has a skilled and competitive labor force. It's a country that competes in international markets, is politically stable, and is a functioning democracy. Thus, it stands apart from many countries in the world.</p><h4>How can Mexico take advantage of its resources and make the most of its strategic position as a supplier for the US market?</h4><p>That is something we are already addressing in Mexico. We like to work with local suppliers and international companies that are based in Mexico to provide goods and services for our operations in the US and Canada, as well as all around the world. There is a very well-trained workforce here, one that is competitive and well integrated into the international arena, and already known as an important supplier.</p><h4>You are operating a refinery in the US with PEMEX. How is that operation performing?</h4><p>It is a very successful joint venture, which in 2013 celebrated its 20th anniversary. I congratulate those who foresaw the need for this operation 20 years ago and created the right framework in which such a project could succeed. We are looking at how we can make it last another 20 years and beyond. It is a partnership that has worked well for both PEMEX and Shell.</p><h4>You have another important project in Mexico; The Sourcing Office. What is the performance of these projects in terms of employees?</h4><p>The Sourcing Office was established two years ago and has proven to be highly successful. We have been working with local suppliers and bringing them up to speed on subjects such as health, safety, and environment (HSE), compliance, and internal bidding processes, for example. We have come a long way and expect to progress further in Mexico, which puts the nation in a formidable position. And should the energy reforms succeed in attracting further investors into the country, the authorities will be pleased to discover that there is already a solid base of suppliers for them to work with.</p><h4>What future investment plans do you have in Mexico?</h4><p>We expect the energy sector to implement this opening, but are waiting to see the details of the entire energy reform law, along with its implementation, to ascertain how far companies like ours can compete in Mexico not only upstream, but also throughout the full value chain. I assume that we will need to wait until around the middle of 2014 before the secondary laws are in place, and in the meantime we will be closely monitoring the process.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What services do you provide to the Saudi Arabian people and where is the council positioned in the network of national healthcare and private providers?</h4><p>The health insurance law was announced by the Saudi Arabian Royal Cabinet in August 1999, and the law aims to cover everyone working in the private sector, be they Saudi or non-Saudi nationals—around 12 million people are targeted by this law. It does not cover public-sector workers. The health insurance system constitutes around one-third of the Saudi health system. The Council of Cooperative Health Insurance (CCHI) is an independent governmental agency that seeks to govern the lawful rights of the insured. The main stakeholders are health insurance companies, employers, who pay the health insurance premiums, and the healthcare providers. The CCHI's task is to ensure that the law is carried out to the satisfaction of those covered. Healthcare service providers, including public and private healthcare facilities such as Ministry of Health hospitals, have to register with the CCHI to be eligible to treat insured patients. The Minister of Health chairs the CCHI board, which consists of 10 council members. The CCHI shares responsibility with the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA). SAMA regulates the insurance companies as a financial entity; they regulate and control the financial aspect of the health insurance sector, including the solvency issue. SAMA applies the insurance companies' law. The employers are fundamental stakeholders. The CCHI deals with other stakeholders, too, and they're represented on the board. They are the Ministers of the Interior, Health, Finance, Labor, and Trade, the Chamber of Commerce, government healthcare providers, and the insurance sector.  The CCHI expects groups to be targeted for health insurance, such as visitors to Saudi Arabia, whether for business, leisure, or educational purposes. Another issue is universal health insurance, which is awaiting a government decision. There will be health insurance for the remaining two-thirds of the population. It would be a social health insurance system, like those we see in Europe.</p><h4>In 1999, the act that formed the CCHI was amended to require those Saudis working in the private sector to have private health insurance. How did the CCHI respond to that change?</h4><p>When the law was created in 1999, it was applied to non-Saudis working in the private sector, stipulating that it might later include Saudis working in the private sector as well. That amendment came through in 2003 or 2004, and it was up to the CCHI to implement it. We started with the big companies, working our way down through medium to small companies, because we didn't want a bottleneck and we wanted our tools to be ready for everyone; we did it in a sequential way. We started with non-Saudis and their families, then Saudis and their families. The SAMA report can also give you a good idea of how the sector has grown and developed since implementation.</p><div class="quote">“All forms of insurance are becoming accepted"</div><h4>A strong insurance sector is an important asset of a robust national economy. How would you describe Saudi Arabia's insurance sector?</h4><p>When we started the health insurance project, health insurance was not understood or accepted by some communities. Now, all forms of insurance are becoming accepted, though the penetration and density is still very low compared to international standards. That means there's a lot of potential to develop the sector.</p><h4>What are the opportunities for foreign private health insurance providers in Saudi Arabia?</h4><p>There cannot be any non-Saudi private healthcare providers in Saudi Arabia. The insurance companies must be Saudi by law and must have a minimum capital requirement of SAR100 million within the country. The company has to be at least 51% Saudi owned, meaning a maximum 49% foreign owned. However, we still see strong potential for major multinationals in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Do you foresee any changes regarding the regulatory structure of investing in the insurance industry or coming to Saudi Arabia as an insurer?</h4><p>Rather than a change of regulation, there might be some additional regulations regarding that. Foreign investment is a good thing: until mid-2013 foreign investors were not allowed to invest in hospitals. Things are changing, but presently foreign investors can only invest in hospitals. The government no longer wants to send people abroad for treatment. The government is thinking of buying services from the private sector, and they want to work with those who know the business. There's a lot of opportunity in this area. When the international hospitals open, they will be fit for medical students. We used to have eight medical schools, now we have more than 24. There's great demand for training centers, at both the undergraduate and post-graduate levels. To sum up, private companies will have the opportunity to sell their services to the government at a reasonable price. They will provide a genuine private business model, offering services that will keep people from having to seek treatment abroad, as well as offer training services for students.</p><h4>Considering this change and momentum in the sector, where do you see the council and the sector as a whole in the coming five years?</h4><p>We're not just tasked with implementation of health insurance laws and regulations; we're also considered a reference body for all issues related to health insurance. In addition, we are expanding our services to customers. In five years we hope to have new tools to insure more people and provide the best quality of insurance possible for them. For this reason we've developed a huge program called the Saudi Health Insurance Bus (SHIB). It's a purely electronic IT hub through which all transactions will pass regarding healthcare providers and insurance companies. We'll be using national standards for communication between these agencies; we'll be using international classifications of diseases, and we're using the national drug code and the national Saudi health data dictionary. All these transactions will be in a coded format so we can serve and support people faster and more efficiently by extracting the indicators and indices for reviewing these statistics. Also, we will need to expand the customer relations department. We used to outsource customer services, but now we feel we need to have that in-house. We're also preparing to move into a new building to support our continued expansion. As well, we will expand to include new groups, such as short-term, non-Saudi visitors. That may also include religious pilgrims who come for the hajj. One final project I'd like to mention is our work with the Saudi Council of Health Services to create a committee for developing health insurance. They will create a specialized curriculum in the health insurance field, in the form of a diploma. We're also working with the Ministry of Higher Education to create a Bachelor's and Master's degree in health insurance in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is High Tech Park and what has it achieved since its establishment?</h4><p>High Tech Park came about via HE President Ilham Aliyev's decree on November 5, 2012. This decree was signed within the Azerbaijan 2020: Vision of the Future framework, the main vision of which is to shift income from energy resources to help develop human capital. High Tech Park is considered one of the pillars of the Golden Triangle for the future development of ICT in Azerbaijan, which also include the IT University and the State Fund for IT Development. High Tech Park started its activity in the middle of 2013 and, to date, we have almost completed the staff formation, where the average age of the young and ambitious team is 29. At the same time we have been granted 50 hectares of land on Pirallahi Island, very close to Baku. The most important part of the project is that the sum of the tax incentives for investors and potential resident companies has already been confirmed by our parliament in a very short time frame, which includes exemption from land, real estate, and VAT on necessary infrastructural and technological imports, as well as corporate income taxes for a seven-year period. Other incentives that are currently being discussed include migration and customs incentives. Taking into account that the development of the land will take some time, and in order not to lose time, we established the Pi-Campus, an incubation center with the goal of supporting high-tech startups in the heart of Baku. The “Pi" comes from the name of the island, as well as the mathematical symbol. We are currently finalizing the guidelines for developers who want to be a part of this business incubator, and we plan to open our doors in February.</p><h4>What are your milestones in the next few years?</h4><p>According to the statistics, 56% of about 400 similar tech parks around the world are government owned, showing us that government support and involvement is extremely important for such projects. As a company that has been established in order to manage this project, first of all we want to secure projects and investments. We are starting from the previously mentioned Pi-Campus pilot project, but, again, we are also in the site development stage. According to our requirements, and based on our initial research and negotiations, first of all the general master plan of the site must be established. Since the project itself is a new one, we are creating an infrastructural package for potential investors alongside the master plan of the development. Hence, during 2014, we also plan to finalize an attractive business package for our future investors.</p><div class="quote">“We define innovation as invention plus commercialization."</div><h4>What balance are you seeking between domestic and international investors?</h4><p>We are trying to avoid any kind of limitation. We are looking for businesses. If a local business brings us an interesting idea, of course we will develop and market that. However, if foreign investors come with valuable projects, of course we are open to them as well. We are interested to see if foreign companies will bring their R&amp;D centers to Azerbaijan, and, most importantly, we want to see what they will demand for such moves. One of our main purposes is to create a regional technology park and become one of the top players in the region. While we are working on that, we will also continue research on attracting possible anchor tenants who are interested in basing themselves at High Tech Park. That is the second part of the simultaneous work that will be taking part over the next couple of years. First, we will prepare a short list, and then one by one we will ascertain the requirements that each company is willing to come to Azerbaijan for. The third stage, obviously, is to adapt a flexible master plan that will attract and accommodate the needs of the anchor tenants.</p><h4>To what extent do you think that Azerbaijan is prepared to become an innovation center?</h4><p>We define innovation as invention plus commercialization. To make more inventions possible in Azerbaijan, High Tech Park will provide state-of-the-art infrastructure. To make the commercialization of those inventions possible, we believe Azerbaijan is well positioned with its own economy and regional position. Furthermore, our culture is open to trade and commerce. What motivates us the most is the passion Azerbaijan's youth shows for high technologies. You can find many Azerbaijani IT specialists who are working in different IT companies worldwide. This is why we are starting a new kind of a project, but at the same time we already have a base that we plan to tap into to make this project a national and regional success story.</p><h4>At what stage of development is Pi-Campus?</h4><p>The Pi-Campus incubator will begin operating in February. Right now, we have been primarily shortlisting and engaging all the projects that are capable of becoming part of the incubator, and there are 13 live projects and two at the planning stage that want to be a part of High Tech Park. We are first launching the incubation center part of Pi-Campus. Next, the residency benefits will be available, since there is a certain procedure that needs to be followed before the companies can become residents that are eligible for all the previously expressed tax incentives.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wide-ambition]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Allur Auto was established in 2003. How has the company, and the Kazakhstani auto market, evolved since then?</h4><p>The auto market only really developed after Kazakhstan entered the Customs Union (CU), because Kazakhstan—with a population of just 17 million—is a very small market. The Russian market, by contrast, is large. The CU was what gave us the ambition and commitment to become involved in car assembly and production. We had a distribution and import company here for some time, but our market share didn't really grow, remaining at around 10%. The other 90% was dominated by unregistered used car dealers that didn't pay VAT. There are 3 million cars in Kazakhstan, and 80% of them, about 2.5 million, are at least 20 years old. That's because Kazakhstan didn't have a customs duty on secondhand cars, so naturally that's what everyone imported and sold. The CU increased customs duties to 30%, and car manufacturers were suddenly given incentives to develop. The government supports auto companies in Kazakhstan, although only two companies receive government support: our company—Agromash Holding in Kostanay—and Azia Avto in Ust-Kamenogorsk, which produces models for Skoda, Kia, and Avtobus, an old Russian brand. Our plan is to produce SsangYong, Peugeot, Iveco, and Zaz, a new, low-cost, market-leading producer from Ukraine. Today, our biggest competitors are Nexia—an Uzbek car—and AvtoVAZ. Generally, our customers don't go for cars priced at over $11,000, and the same can be said for the Russian and Ukrainian market, given limited levels of disposable income. The people buying new cars today are largely those who formerly purchased secondhand vehicles.</p><h4>You're the official distributor of Iveco, SsangYong, Peugeot, and ZAZ. How have these brands performed competitively?</h4><p>Iveco is our largest partner for which we produce commercial vehicles, and in November 2013 we commence manufacturing large industrial vehicles based on the Iveco Trakker. This model comes with one year's free taxation in four classes, and Iveco approves of our strategy for the Russian market. The Iveco Power Daily, a commercial passenger vehicle, has proved especially popular. We have around an 8% share of the commercial vehicle market, approximately 7% of the auto market in Kazakhstan, and a 42% share or the agricultural vehicle market. We have a joint venture with Kominmash, a Belarusian company, and we're currently in discussions regarding the production of CNH agricultural equipment, where CNH manufactures for New Holland and Case. The fact that Kazakhstan has a huge agriculture sector, being the sixth largest grain exporter in the world, makes this is a significant proposition. Iveco also produces for Fiat, which has an incredible range of models. Ultimately, however, our ambition lies in the Russian market, where sales revenues are large enough to keep our costs low.</p><div class="quote">“The auto market only really developed after Kazakhstan entered the Customs Union (CU)."</div><h4>How do you view the government's approach toward the car manufacturing industry?</h4><p>The government understands process localization. We need time for localization and to develop this business. In November we're taking our second big step in Kazakhstan, a CKD business, with painting and welding. We are expanding our business and the government is aware of our efforts. We have 30% localization for SsangYong's Nomad model. The model, which SsangYong sells in the global market, is uniquely produced in Kazakhstan. For us this is a dream come true, because it means real localization. Combined with our strategy for exporting to the Russian market, this marks a significant national development. We discussed this opportunity with President Nazarbayev in 2010, when we met at our plant. I told him we have a real opportunity for innovation, along with a concrete business plan and strategy, and he gave his personal endorsement. In doing this we changed the entire strategy for this sector of the economy, as well as the approach of the government. I've given my all to achieving this, and it has finally paid off.</p><h4>Do you have regional expansion plans?</h4><p>For the Russian market, we think of ourselves only as producers, and not distributors. To develop owner distributorship in Russia involves a huge capital investment. In Kazakhstan we have 13 dealers, but in Russia we'd need 100 dealers. We're also considering Belarus, although it's a small market and quite risk-heavy due to political issues. We're also thinking of Kyrgyzstan, but it's also small and relatively volatile. Azerbaijan is an option, and though it isn't in the CU, it doesn't have excessive customs duties. We have a partner there and are currently discussing our expansion plan. We're thinking of expanding there via Port Aktau. But for the next five years at least, or primary target is to develop exports to the Russian market. It's such a big market and 70% of our capacity is dedicated to it alone.</p><h4>What's your outlook for Allurauto and Kazakhstan over the coming 18 months?</h4><p>The market doubled in 2012 and will continue to grow. With around 168,000 vehicles, the market has yet to reach its full capacity of around 300,000 vehicles. I expect the market to have doubled by 2017. The B and C segment should grow substantially, as should the SUV market.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, UKTI established a dedicated trade officer at the British High Commission in Maputo. How would you characterize the importance of the economic relationship between Mozambique and the UK?</h4><p>Mozambique's economy has been growing at a phenomenal rate, and we expect this to continue. Mozambique remains a small market, but a dynamic one, and its natural resources of gas and coal could prove transformative. UK goods exports to Mozambique increased over 80% in 2012, and continue to rise; and the UK imported nearly £80 million from Mozambique over the same period. We also provide Mozambique with £70 million to £80 million each year in development assistance, so it is an important and growing relationship. But as the UK Minister with responsibility for Africa, I believe we must be even more ambitious. It is for that reason that I have selected Mozambique as a High Level Prosperity Partner. This initiative, which I formally launched on November 19, 2013 marks an exciting next step in our bilateral relationship and will see the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development and UK Trade and Investment working with the government of Mozambique across a number of key sectors, including agriculture, minerals, and financial services, to share expertise and achieve a paradigm shift in our economic relations. I visited Mozambique in July (for the second time in 2013) and I know the Mozambican government is right behind the initiative. Our shared goal is to generate prosperity and jobs in both Mozambique and Britain.</p><h4>British companies were among the first to make new investments in the Mozambican economy following the end of the civil war in 1992. How would you characterize the role that British investors are playing in Mozambique's development?</h4><p>UK companies play a critical role in Mozambique's economy. They are major employers and exporters. They bring capital, know-how, jobs, and high standards of corporate governance and social responsibility, and the skills and expertise they are sharing with the local workforce are critical for the country's development. For example, I visited Lonrho's impressive operation at Maputo harbor, where products freshly fished from the sea by Mozambicans are frozen by the quayside, and are then shipped and on the shelves of UK supermarkets within 72 hours. The fact that President Guebuza chose to come to Aberdeen earlier in 2013 to learn from our experience in developing North Sea oil and gas demonstrates the positive reputation we already enjoy in Mozambique. The High Level Prosperity Partnership, which I discussed with the President in Aberdeen, will develop this even further. For example, I have invited Mozambique's Minister for Agriculture to my Lincolnshire constituency to visit farmers, supermarkets, and agricultural colleges to see for himself where UK expertise might be most valuable in key areas such as education, agriculture, and flood control. The Mozambican government is keen to encourage the sort of quality investment that UK business delivers.</p><div class="quote">“UK companies play a critical role in Mozambique's economy."</div><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What powers did the Coffee Act of 2001 grant to the board?</h4><p>The Coffee Board is a government institution that was established by Parliamentary Act No. 23 of 2001. Its basic priority was to ensure sector regulation in terms of coffee cultivation, processing, and trade. Monitoring of these three aspects makes sure of a defined means of crop production, which is governed by the rules of production. It takes care of quality issues and aims to secure volumes in terms of production. The second issue is to ensure that processing is also focused on market needs, which requires standardized processing. The third issue concerns marketing and trade, largely because more than 90% of the crop is exported. We have to know the destination; who is exporting it, and where it will go. This is so we can analyze consumer trends and behavior, while knowing how much we generate from the market.</p><h4>How will Tanzania achieve its goal of increasing its coffee output to 80,000 tons by 2016, and what role do investors play in that growth?</h4><p>In 2010, we created what we call a Coffee Sector Strategy, which lays out plans for the next 10 years. The strategy will end in 2021. It was made in collaboration with stakeholders in the sector, and we have set certain goals and milestones. In the first five years, which ends in 2016, we targeted to increase our production from 50,000 tons to 80,000 tons. Then, by 2021, we hope production will exceed 100,000 tons. We want to improve the quality of the coffee and the business environment, as well as expand the market. In terms of the volume increase, it will be achieved by ensuring that crops are improved through research. We have a national coffee research center here called the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI). TaCRI was set up in 2001 and by 2005 had already started to release some good varieties of coffee. The plants were crossbred to upgrade their strains. Productivity has to date almost doubled from the average of 300 grams to almost 600-700 grams. On the ground, it has been confirmed that our average production would rise from 350 kilograms to 1,000-1,500 kilograms per hectare, which is the target. Today, we have an estimated 200,000 hectares under coffee cultivation; we plan to increase this by 10,000 to 210,000 hectares within this timeframe. We have already involved all the growing regions and relevant government institutions in this strategy. Land expansion is the second part of the strategy to increase production. The third aspect takes into account the current business environment, whereby production is 90% realized by smallholder growers. Our third drive seeks to entice investors to coffee cultivation, and not only in the trading of produced coffee. In collaboration with government institutions and authorities, we have identified areas where investors can access land for coffee cultivation. For example, in 2011, one company was given 2,000 hectares in southern Tanzania, where there is reserve land. It has already started to plant coffee and is poised to commence production. Small owners will always seek government support to continue their business, whereas investors will go out on their own; you only encounter them when conducting trade. More private sector investment is the way ahead.</p><div class="quote">“Tanzania is among the three countries that produce the best Arabica coffee."</div><h4>What does Tanzania bring to the table in terms of unique coffee varieties?</h4><p>Tanzania is one of the top three quality coffee producers. Coffee quality is defined in two categories: one, the origin and the conditions of growing in that area, and two, the processing and handling. If you go to the source, Tanzania is among the three countries (the other two are Colombia and Kenya) that produce the best Arabica coffee. We have the opportunity to have the best Arabica and Colombian milds, which is usually used for blending with other Arabicas to improve their flavor. The Arabica coffee bean needs to have the pulp removed to prepare it for roasting. You can also sundry it to prepare for roasting. Preparations under wet processing (pulping) produces mild or washed Arabica coffee. The sun-dried coffee is called hard, or unwashed coffee. The washed is the best type because it is mild and attractive. It requires the right infrastructure on the ground during harvesting, however, so farmers can execute the washing process at wet mills. The equipment is used for removing the skin, fermenting, cleaning, and then drying the beans. We lacked this infrastructure for many years. When a farmer is preparing this alone, they pulp by hand. They need to have the correct cleaning water and drying facilities, which is a challenge for small farms. What we have done since 2001, under the new law, is decide that Tanzanian coffee should be fully washed to remain competitive with Colombia and Kenya. Investment in these wet mills and washing stations has been ongoing since then, and we are about halfway through the necessary requirements with about 450 mills throughout the country already installed.</p><h4>What lies in the future for Tanzanian coffee?</h4><p>Since 2012, we have been working with an organization in Geneva to establish a Tanzania intellectual property system for coffee so we can brand and protect it. We hope it will help to bring home the intrinsic value of this product. We have been challenged a few times when people travel around the world and see Kenyan or Colombian coffee, but not Tanzanian coffee. That is because we have not protected it. Most of the traders use our quality coffee to blend it with regular- or low-quality coffee so that it can be sold. To be protected, we have to change the way we promote our name in the market.</p><h4>What could you say about public-private partnerships (PPP) in this sector?</h4><p>The drive that started in 2010 has been very strong. Part of what is happening, which previously was not there, was the implementation of a PPP system. We have all the stakeholders, and coffee has a long value chain. We have different players at each of these levels, and sometimes it is a challenge to bring all of them together in a common place. We have managed to catch up and we meet as a national coffee forum to discuss the way forward. As a result of that, as of June 2013 (because the crop starts in September), we had already produced over 70,000 tons for the first time in 50 years, the average having been 50,000 tons, and also our highest year. We want to maintain this level and reach 100,000 tons by 2021. That is why we see our 2016 goal of 80,000 tons as achievable; we need less than 10,000 tons more from now on. This increase has resulted from working with the stakeholders to ensure increased volumes.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the importance of PepsiCo Mexico in the company's global operations?</h4><p>In regard to beverages, PepsiCo arrived in Mexico in 1907; however, foods came later, approximately 70 years ago, when the company purchased a local foods entrepreneur. His company had a very small production facility and we initially launched a potatoes and wheat line. Currently, Mexico is the second largest market for PepsiCo outside the US, with Russia in first place. In Russia, we acquired a large dairy company and a juice operation. I like nothing more than taking on challenges, and my team reacts very well to them.</p><h4>PepsiCo Mexico offers more than 20 brands. Which are in the highest demand here?</h4><p>In terms of snacks, basically it is Sabritas, Ruffles, Doritos, Cheetos, and Fritos, which are all potato chips. Regarding our biscuit business unit, we have Emperador, and Marí­as, a traditional Mexican cookie. Those are the two most important cookie brands. In our foods business unit, we have Quaker products and we also have a confectionary product line called Sonric's. In beverages, we have Pepsi, Mirinda, Manzanita Sol, Gatorade, and 7up.</p><div class="quote">“We have to deliver the numbers, but we also have to make sure the company is sustainable for the future."</div><h4>Which offer the greatest potential for growth?</h4><p>We are seeing the greatest potential in the fact that all the products are growing equally. In the future, the demand for nutritious products is bound to grow. For example, in Quaker, we have Quaker cookies, which make oats more accessible to our customers. Innovation is also crucial. In 2013, we launched new products in the cereal area for young people who want more protein, fewer calories, and a great taste. We are offering value-added products, meaning that the company is increasingly starting to target different segments. This is where we see the potential for attracting new consumers.</p><h4>What new products are you planning to launch?</h4><p>We have already launched Ruffles Extra Crunch, which is a thicker potato cut and with extra spice. We also launched a soft brownie, called Chokis brownie, which utilized a new technology. As said, we have also launched Stila cereal, made using a unique technology, and which offers high protein content—a basic necessity.</p><h4>How do you adapt your products through innovation?</h4><p>We operate a very robust “stage gate" process. This process begins in the hopper, which is where we collect ideas from all over the world. We introduce many different sources of thinking and innovation there. Once there, we apply a very specific filter every three months. Then, we choose which products leave the hopper and go into the stage gate process, and after that we begin a process of six or seven stages wherein, if the product meets certain criteria, it proceeds to the next stage. Each one of the products can either come through a breakthrough, a lift and adapt, or a line extension. Increasingly, we are focusing on breakthrough products.</p><h4>What are some of the peculiarities of the Mexican market?</h4><p>This market caters to a highly demanding consumer who has been used to these products for many years. For Mexicans, tortillas have been consumed since the time of the Aztecs, so to satisfy the consumer we have to offer the best tortilla products. The Mexican consumer loves repertoire, meaning they want to change from one product to another and eat many different brands. Also, the Mexican consumer is very sensitive to price points, which means they want to buy a product by size and weight, and they want options. The Mexican consumer is much more sensitive to certain tastes than other markets; therefore, we have a process to determine the shelf life of the product and make daily taste quality checks.</p><h4>What is the current performance of your production plants?</h4><p>All of our plants operate with state-of-the-art technology. We invest increasingly in two things: automated packaging and package flexibility. The plants are receiving huge investments. In 2009, our Chairman and CEO, Indra K. Nooyi, announced an investment of $3 billion over the subsequent five years. Much of that was capital investment to automate the plants and boost flexibility. We will continue with this and aim to make another multi-year announcement. We have been present for more than 100 years and this market of more than 20 million people remains attractive for us, and will continue to attract our investment. In regard to the food lines, we regularly visit almost 900,000 customers, many of them more than once a week. Therefore, we make around 2 million sales calls per week. When people ask me what I do, I tell them two things: we are an agro-company because we buy numerous products from farmers, but we also connect with people every week nationwide. We have an extended network in every major city and some smaller cities around the country.</p><h4>How do you train your workforce?</h4><p>This is one of the areas where we have seen the most recognition. We have two areas: training and development. In the area of training, we have established and extended a platform that we developed for executives, managers, coordinators, and analysts called PepsiCo University. At the distribution centers and plants, we now have digital classrooms where people can take these courses online. From there, we have built a very robust program of development that includes those in “boot camp," who then graduate to management. They go to the leadership academy, where directors receive very advanced training. We have been recognized by PepsiCo as one of the best markets in terms of developing people, especially general managers.</p><h4>What are your efforts to protect the environment?</h4><p>At PepsiCo, performance with purpose is our philosophy. We have to deliver the numbers, but we also have to make sure the company is sustainable for the future. I really enjoy that our team set up a five-year plan with goals related to water savings. We wanted to achieve 25% water savings within five years, and in less than five years now use 40% less water. This will make a big difference in terms of saving water and protecting the environment. We are also doing a lot in energy; today, 25% of our energy comes from wind power. We also actively participate in recycling and waste management programs. For me, that is one of the beauties of this company. We have the scale to invest in the areas that make a difference for the future, the people, and the planet.</p><h4>How will the new reforms affect you?</h4><p>We are hopeful and our outlook for Mexico remains good. The reforms will really help the country break through current bottlenecks, and in particular we applaud the labor- and education-related reforms. Others, like the fiscal reform, we don't necessarily agree will be for the best. Meanwhile, from a health perspective, we believe that obesity has multiple factors, and I think that simply levying taxes on certain products only distorts the problem. We have been here for a long time and PepsiCo wants to be part of the obesity solution; therefore, we are working with many groups to obtain a better understanding of how to truly address obesity. For example, in 2013, we were the first company in Mexico to sign an agreement with the Ministry of Social Development in the Crusade against Hunger program.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[on-the-agenda]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have the Chamber's achievements been over the past year?</h4><p>Firstly, with the reinforcement of the main activities of our chamber, we have developed a much stronger capacity to work with our own affiliates. We did this through a program of personal visits to about 180 of the 430 enterprises that are our current members. The result is that now we have a much larger agenda with each enterprise. For example, we have 13 committees: a labor committee, a social responsibility committee, an arbitration committee, and a tax committee, among others. Companies choose which committees they have an interest in being a part of, and exchange and share best practices with other enterprises to build up consensus on economic problems. Enterprises normally prefer us to voice our concerns to the government, rather than having one enterprise alone addressing those issues. Among other things to mention is the media coverage of certain social responsibility programs that mark interesting advances of our Chamber. We pursue a very close engagement with key journals in Colombia, having included El Tiempo and Portafolio as members of our Chamber and part of our board, and we have increased the presence of our Chamber in the media through an important improvement; our publications. The amount of activity, and the presence of our Chamber in the private sector in Colombia, have increased. We have become a more relevant Chamber in terms of the agenda between Colombia and the US, and thus for each of our members. We have been working directly with the trade office of the US in the trade missions of different US states communicating with Colombia. We have been working on a matchmaking exercise and, for the first time, we sent a mission of Colombian enterprises to Philadelphia. We are essentially working in two directions, helping Colombian enterprises to reach the US, and US entrepreneurs to invest in Colombia and secure good partnerships and solid business opportunities.</p><h4>US companies represent around 12% of Colombia's GDP; what is the potential for US companies to invest in Colombia?</h4><p>Infrastructure is an interesting area, because of the gigantic investment that the Colombian government and the private sector will be committing to regarding the building of roads, railroads, ports, and airports, and also in the drilling of rigs, especially in the Magdalena River, which I would say is a substantial project that brings much investment and work. Then I would say that there is still strong potential in the oil and gas sector, and in the food industry. Certain difficulties have hampered such investment, but I think that the government is working in the right direction and that those investments still represent very interesting possibilities for US entrepreneurs.</p><h4>What are the primary advantages for companies coming to Colombia, in terms of the legal framework and taxation?</h4><p>I think that infrastructure for the protection of foreign investment has been built up with the free zones, in which businesses are exempt from income tax across an important range of sectors. For example, hotel construction, technology, and research rank among sectors destined to receive incentives. Aside from these zones, there are other instruments designed to safeguard foreign investment, such as the Juridical Stability Agreements approved roughly one year ago.</p><div class="quote">“I think that infrastructure for the protection of foreign investment has been built up with the free zones."</div><h4>Which Colombian cities do you think could be of most interest to US companies?</h4><p>It depends very much on what type of company they are. If you consider, for example, the import/export business, I would highlight Barranquilla and Cartagena, which have ports in the Caribbean and offer other interesting opportunities. For those companies considering production in Colombia, I would underline Medellí­n, which has become very competitive, although it is in the interior of the country. Finally, if you are focused on the potential of the Pacific Alliance, then Cali offers very interesting opportunities, not only because it is the largest Colombian city on the Pacific Ocean, but also because it has the perspective of developing further investment and trade relations with Asia.</p><h4>What do you think are the benefits of the Pacific Alliance for Colombia and why do you think it could be considered historic?</h4><p>I think that it is an historic decision because, since we created the integration process with the Andean Community in 1969, we have not signed such a multi-lateral agreement with regional countries. The four countries of this Alliance have already negotiated free trade agreements (FTAs) among themselves, and so economic considerations are important. There is also a common political outlook in our shared desire to boost ties with Asia. Colombia is the only country that hasn't negotiated any agreement with China, so it is an exciting prospect for us. The US has become an observer in the Pacific Alliance, which could perhaps be a prelude to full membership. This would be very interesting for the group. Colombia is today a part of UNASUR and La Comunidad de Estados Latino Americanos y el Caribe (CELAC).</p><h4>Colombia's stability and security is essential for attracting FDI? What do you think is the potential for peace in the future?</h4><p>I think that the past 10 years have been proof of the advance that Colombia has achieved with regard to security issues. As at the end of 2001, Colombia was registering 69 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants per year; today, the figure has fallen to 32. Moreover, the number of kidnappings has fallen from more than 3,000 per year 10 or 11 years ago to around 300 today, which is 10 times less. There is no doubt that an improvement in security affects the country's attractiveness for foreign investment. I think there is a chance for peace. The Colombians have been through many attempts to reach a peace agreement and so we are naturally guarded about such processes, but I am cautiously optimistic.</p><h4>Following the FTA signed with the US, what is your outlook for the relations between these countries in the near future?</h4><p>I was a witness to the meeting of President Santos and President Obama, and I think that the important thing is that now we have a stable agenda that is no longer focused on narcotics and security, but includes many other issues such as FTAs, research issues, social issues, and also education and health.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you think diversification will play in bringing Kazakhstan into the future, especially in terms of the government's 2050 Strategy?</h4><p>I think that all resource-based economies, whether it is Qatar, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, or Norway for that matter, face challenges because of their heavy dependence on a few commodities, the price of which is market driven. This also makes these economies vulnerable to economic shocks if commodity prices go down. Since economic growth is so linked to changes in the price of oil and gas, or whatever commodity a country depends on, the question is how to sustain economic growth. How do you keep on providing services to your people while you are on a downward cycle? This is always a challenge. And different countries have different responses to this question. A diversified economy is perhaps the best guard against market volatility. Other countries have used the higher revenues earned during up-cycles and invested them wisely for rainy days.</p><h4>How do you think public-private partnerships (PPPs) will be used to further leverage the advantage of the country?</h4><p>There are two reasons to undertake PPPs, i.e. projects based on PPP: first, to supplement fiscal budgets and, second, to improve the delivery of public services. Kazakhstan epitomizes the need for PPPs. It is a vast, landlocked country, and faces challenges related to insufficient and aging infrastructure. Given its vastness and need for connectivity, it requires new and better infrastructure, including roads, railways, airports, airlines, power, and gas distribution networks. This requires a lot of money. So far, the infrastructure has been funded and provided by the government or public agencies. They all face fiscal constraints. Thus, PPPs should be seen not as a replacement or substitute for the government, but as an off-balance sheet tool to increase investments in infrastructure and other areas of interest. The second important reason, sometimes considered even more important than the first, is to improve the quality and efficiency of public services. That means that PPPs allow a country to not only improve the quality of public services, but also to build these services in the first place. Well-structured PPP projects not only help rationalize project costs, but they also help reduce project completion times. PPPs are a great mechanism to avoid the building of white elephants, since private sector investors seek a return on their capital. This is why nearly every country in today's world has some sort of a PPP program, including Kazakhstan. So, you may ask, if PPPs are such a great tool, why there are only a limited number of examples of successful PPPs in the developing world? The answer is that PPPs work under stable and predictable frameworks and require strong commitment from governments. IFC intends to facilitate infrastructure development through PPP advisory work and direct investments with both private sector and sub-national sponsors. In fact, IFC, jointly with the EBRD, is advising the government on its first large-scale PPP project for the Almaty Ring Road, which we hope will open up another opportunity for private capital to invest in the infrastructure sector in Kazakhstan.</p><div class="quote">“IFC is committed to improving corporate governance as a way of promoting sustainable private sector investment."</div><h4>IFC is advising on corporate governance. How would you rate the enforcement of sound corporate governance locally?</h4><p>IFC is committed to improving corporate governance as a way of promoting sustainable private sector investment and strengthening capital markets in emerging markets. We see that corporate governance development is a pressing issue for Kazakhstani companies due to many factors, including the intention of companies to go public, attract domestic and foreign investment, and enhance operational efficiency and image. The outlook for corporate governance standards implementation could be considered positive because both the government and the business community recognize the necessity for improving corporate governance practices in Kazakhstan. IFC is a recognized global leader in the promotion of corporate governance standards and has developed a globally respected and well-tested methodology for evaluating corporate governance practices, risks, and opportunities. In Kazakhstan, IFC, together with its two partners, offers corporate governance services for companies and financial institutions, including thematic training, tailored diagnostic reviews, consultations on specific corporate governance matters, and in-depth assessments with implementation plans. In our work with companies we apply the IFC Corporate Governance Methodology and its tools customized to the needs of companies, including for listed companies, family-owned businesses, financial institutions, privatized companies, and state-owned enterprises. This methodology provides a framework for an examination of the current state of corporate governance, followed by an identification of areas for improvement, and support in the implementation of key recommendations. Good corporate governance is about far more than minimum compliance with laws and regulations. When implemented, good corporate governance brings significant benefits to companies and their long-term sustainability. We therefore believe that it is important to develop practical ways of encouraging companies to do more than comply with regulations in order to bring them the very real benefits good governance brings. One way to assist companies in this regard is the Corporate Governance Scorecard, a simple tool developed by IFC that allows companies to conduct a systematic analysis of a company's governance situation.</p><h4>Where do you see the challenges in Kazakhstan when it comes to diversification and training?</h4><p>The government here has many programs to improve education. When we think about education, we usually think about higher education, such as universities. They are very important aspects, but one of the challenges that we always face is with vocational training that is needed to improve people's skills. I think partnerships between industry and education institutions are very important to find out what is required and what can then be taught at a university or an institute level, which then make these people employable as they go forward into the workforce.</p><h4>Kazakhstan's banking sector is stable, but there are issues with 30% of the loan book. What needs to be done to overcome this challenge?</h4><p>A well-functioning financial sector and improved access to finance remains an important element of the growth and diversification agenda. Improved access to finance is essential for the growth of the non-oil sector growth in line with the government of Kazakhstan's efforts on diversification. The government has done a number of things to restore the health of the banking sector. It has recently announced the privatization of the banks that needed to be rescued during the financial crises. A new legal framework governing bankruptcy and insolvency is also being developed to address problems of highly indebted firms—an essential foundation for the resolution of NPLs. Efforts are needed to ensure proper loan valuation and provisioning, and decisive actions are required to reduce bad loans and replenish bank capital where needed. An important challenge is the further development of credit infrastructure—pledge and real estate registries, microfinance, factoring, leasing, and venture capital—and the deepening of the local currency bond market so that multiple sources of financing for the private sector at competitive prices can be developed. The development of non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) is also important. In Kazakhstan, NBFIs are significantly underdeveloped compared to countries with comparable income levels. NBFIs are usually more effective than commercial banks in market segments delimited by the characteristics of borrowers (smaller firms, rural areas) or by type of financial product. The use of financial instruments that can enhance access to finance, such as leasing, factoring, and trade-credit financing, could be further promoted by introducing a more conducive legal and institutional framework.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>It is important for the Dominican Republic to abandon boom and bust cycles and aim for stability. What evidence of stable growth have you witnessed over the past year?</h4><p>The remarkable performance in the Dominican Republic's economy and the competitive advantages of doing business have provided increased flows of FDI into the productive sectors nationwide. Furthermore, foreign investment has been one of the main driving forces of the Dominican economy in recent years, due largely in part to the macroeconomic stability and the positive growth rates that have been sustained, transforming the country into one of the strongest economies in the Caribbean and one of the most important in the Latin American region. During 2012, the Dominican economy grew 3.9%, higher than the regional average (3%) and above the average growth of the world economy (3.1%), according to the IMF. Favorable export performance, which saw an increase of 5.4% compared to 2012, was also recorded. Thanks to legal assurance and economic stability, and the benefits of the country outlined in a strategy developed by our President, HE Danilo Medina, our country was recognized by the Financial Times for the year 2013/2014 as having the second best strategy in the Caribbean and Central America to attract foreign investment. Similarly, according to the Global Competitiveness Report 2013/2014, recently published by the WEF, the Dominican Republic is positioned in 11th place after evaluating 148 countries worldwide in terms of FDI and transfer of technology, which demonstrates the quality and impact on the local economy of investment flows into the country.</p><h4>Which economic sectors comprise the largest portion of exports, and which are growing the most?</h4><p>The total exports of the Dominican Republic increased 8.3% compared to 1Q2012 due to a significant growth in gold exports, making the mining sector the fastest growing industry for its international market value in FOB terms. These positive results are the result of growth in sectors such as tobacco, medical and surgical equipment, electrical components, textiles, and footwear manufacturing. Nevertheless, among national exports, the agricultural and agribusiness sector, with products like cigars, coffee, rum, banana, avocado, and cocoa, contributed to an important share in terms of total quantity of exports, generating important labor force growth. The Dominican Republic also stands out when it comes to organic products, with the global demand for our products growing quickly.</p><h4>International trade is a precursor of investments. What significant growth areas exist?</h4><p>Significant growth areas observed for multilateral trade belong to the agriculture and agro-industrial line of products, including more non-traditional products, such as organic bananas to the UK; rum to the EU (Spain), Chile, the US, and Japan; cocoa to the US, the Netherlands, and Italy; avocado to the US, Canada, and Italy; dry coconuts to the US and Canada; and handmade cigars to the US, the EU, and Asia.</p><div class="quote">“The Dominican Republic has preferential access to more than 882 million consumers worldwide."</div><h4>What recent reforms has the government put in place to promote exports?</h4><p>In accordance with Law No. 488-08, which establishes the Regulatory Regime for the Development and Competitiveness of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MIPYMES), published on December 30, 2008, and strategic development guidelines from our President, HE Danilo Medina, the Dominican Republic is focused on promoting opportunities for small businesses, and small business development centers (SBDC), for their insertion into global markets, such as financing, integration, associative practices, and capacity building. Such businesses now represent 90% of our total economic structure and job generation. Specific efforts have been put into agribusinesses. The government has assigned the responsibility of designing and implementing the respective work plans on different public institutions. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce (MIC), through its Vice-Ministry of National Council of Promotion and Encouragement of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (PROMIPYME), as well as the Export and Investment Center of the Dominican Republic (CEI-RD), are the key institutions responsible for introducing the necessary programs on entrepreneurship, competitiveness, market access (both local and international), and ICT, as well as the implementation of quality systems, international negotiations, and technical assistance. Nevertheless, private organizations are also strongly engaged in activities to strengthen the role of this sector, including the non-profit National Confederation of Small and Medium Enterprises, Inc. (CODOPYME) and the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic (AIRD). Cooperation agreements are special contributors to the development of the sector, with many successful experiences in the recent years. It is also important to mention the efforts of the government to implement a diplomatic commercial strategy by coordinating the capacity of the diplomatic corps in foreign countries to act as agents in the promotion and encouragement of SMEs and, HE President Danilo Medina, through his support for Law 488-08, is determined to increase the opportunities of micro, small, and medium enterprises as agents for economic growth, poverty reduction, and social stability in our country by personally visiting farmers in rural areas, as well as by ensuring the provision of loans to associations and producers. More than 60 agricultural projects have been the beneficiaries of loans and technical assistance, with the supervision of designated organizations. The creation of an Export-Import Bank in the Dominican Republic, a project that seeks to facilitate access to credit by providing financial inclusion and democratization of credit, is considered to be one of the priorities in terms of presidential goals. The promotion of exports and investments is coordinated by the CEI-RD and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, a committee has been established to follow up on pesticide residue and other contaminants, which occur in agro-exports to the US and EU. As a result of this initiative, during the first trimester of 2013, the number of rejected containers was reduced by 33% in comparison to the same period of 2012. In fact, these actions, combined with free trade agreements (FTAs) and economic integration, contribute to the upward trend in exports to preferential international markets.</p><h4>How strategic are the completion and implementation of FTAs for the improvement of economic exchanges?</h4><p>When we think of free trade we think of an economic theory that involves the analysis and function of imports and exports without restriction. Gaining market access or preserving existing preferences has remained an important motivation for accessing FTAs. However, with the liberalization of trade around the world and the related diminishing size of preferential rents, the growing success of FTAs cannot only be explained by traditional market access motive. Countries are looking beyond market access in FTAs. There are interests in a host of objectives, including importing higher policy standards, strengthening regional policy coordination, locking-in domestic reforms, and even addressing foreign policy issues.</p><h4>What is the CEI-RD doing to encourage further specialization in the economy?</h4><p>When we assumed the leadership of the CEI-RD we pledged to launch an aggressive campaign to target investors, highlighting the attractiveness of the Dominican Republic abroad, offering an extraordinary opportunity for profitable and successful business ventures, including a solid judicial system, as well as social, political, and macroeconomic stability. Our staff is in charge of providing a free, confidential, and comprehensive set of support services to all investors. We offer customized assistance and general legal advice, guiding you through the entire investment process while offering aftercare services once operations in our country have been established. We offer maximum value by compiling the information, targeted services, and human resources related to trade and investment, all in one place. From the initial point of contact, our team guides and takes the investor step-by-step through the business process. Our specialists walk you through the legal framework, licensing regulations, and other procedures and, with the assistance of our industry experts, we provide information on local suppliers, organize business-to-business networking events, and connect the investor with the best sources according to the particular needs. On the other hand, our One Stop Shop for Investment project provides a tool that can offer services related to investment in one centralized location. This ongoing project seeks and guarantees more efficiency in the amount of procedures and documents, and establishes a single point for investors, which leads to a decrease in the total cost of public services and their delivery time and an increase in inbound FDI.</p><h4>How do you orchestrate your policies in order to promote the different demands of the various sectors of the economy?</h4><p>Deep integration and trade are intimately related. Deep arrangements may be necessary to promote trade in certain sectors and economic integration more broadly. For instance, harmonization or mutual recognition of certain regulations may be a prerequisite for trade in services, or competition policy rules may be required to allow comparative advantages to materialize.</p><h4>What is the potential market for investment and trade in the region?</h4><p>The Dominican Republic has preferential access to more than 882 million consumers worldwide. Through our trade agreements we have negotiated favorable and flexible rules of origin, which offer a tremendous advantage for companies doing business in our country. We are one of only six countries in the world with FTAs and preferential market access to the US, through DR-CAFTA, and the EU, through EPA, with very flexible rules of origin. The other five are Mexico, Chile, Morocco, Jordan, and Israel. The Dominican Republic offers a great diversity of business opportunities, where you can earn very good returns on your investment and generate wealth and prosperity. One of these sectors is tourism. In the mid 1980s, the Dominican Republic began to go through a transformation in its productive structure that defined the process of outsourcing and services. From that moment, our country began to develop other non-traditional sectors, such as tourism, which has been allocated significant amounts of foreign investment. In the last 12 years, FDI in the tourism sector amounted to $2.7 billion, representing 12.4% of the total amount registered in the country. Another sector is real estate, which has provided substantial contributions to the Dominican economy in recent years, both as a source of employment and foreign exchange generator. During the analyzed period, this sector received 14.6% of the total foreign investment registered in the country, equivalent to $3.18 billion. In this sector, there are important tourism-oriented real estate projects. Mining is also significant, and in the first decade of this century it has been one of the most attractive activities for the reception of foreign investment in the Dominican Republic. In the period from 2000 to June 2013, total investment in this sector reached $4 billion, representing 18.4% of the total amount of FDI. In 2012, it constituted a major flow of investment, at $1.17 billion. The trade and industry sector has also been one of the most important in the Dominican economy in recent years due to increasing labor and productive development, which has generated significant flows of FDI. During the 2000 to June 2013 period, investment in this sector represented 19.6% of the total amount received by the country, at $4.28 billion. ICT also constitutes one of the main drivers of the services sector in the Dominican Republic. In fact, the advanced infrastructure in this sector, a result of the large flows of FDI reported mostly from the year 2000, have become one of the main advantages for the attraction of investment in our country. During the 2000 to June 2013 period, FDI attracted by this sector amounted to $2.34 billion, representing 10.7% of total FDI over the period. Some other emerging sectors with high potential in the economy are renewable energy and the film industry. The country offers great opportunities for businesses in this sector. The Film Industry Law has created a legal framework that seeks the establishment and sustainability of the film industry in the Dominican Republic. The incentives provided in this law permit fiscal credit of up to 25% of all expenditures made within the Dominican Republic, while also granting income tax exemptions for investors and temporary admission of filming equipment. The Dominican Republic has also emerged as a contact center and business process outsourcing (BPO) hub, with an emerging and attractive industry in place thanks to a series of factors, including well-developed telecommunications infrastructure, a competitive cost structure, the availability of bilingual human resources, and a strategic location. The contact center industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the Dominican Republic. In 2006, there were only 12 companies that had a total of 4,543 agents and 3,800 seats. Currently, it has been estimated that there are 33,000 agents employed in the industry and approximately 27,400 seats. The projections are that the sector will grow by over 80% in the next five years, anticipating that more than 60,000 agents will be employed in the industry by 2016. With the approval of Law 57-07, the Dominican Republic has also laid the foundations to make the country reach, in a short time, self-sufficiency in the field of electric power generation without causing serious damage to the environment. This law provides incentives and tax exemptions for producers of alternative energies, which has made it possible for the Dominican Republic to become one of the major producers of alternative energy in the region. Finally, in software development, the industry has a strong promise in exports. In our country, there are more than 70 software development companies, mostly small and medium in size, with some international experience and many others with export potential.</p><h4>How will the government vision to further develop infrastructure, together with the widening of Panama Canal, impact the Dominican Republic's logistics industry?</h4><p>The strategic location of our island in the center of the Caribbean represents a historical opportunity, which, from the times of the discovery of America, has allowed it to serve as a trade hub and a nerve center where imports and exports converged. This permanent historical advantage is being strengthened by the expansion of the Panama Canal, scheduled for completion in 2015, which will generate the kind of traffic never before seen, including mega post-Panamax and super-Panamax ships, radically changing the dynamics of freight. With the opportunity of transshipment and new marine routes in our vicinity, the Dominican Republic is ready to face the challenge at an optimal leverage, especially through our exports. The Dominican government, through the CEI-RD, has designed a working plan to implement the necessary tasks and promote our country as a hub in the Caribbean, allowing us to achieve the desired levels of development. We have evaluated and visited the main hubs around the world and, based on this benchmarking, have been able to implement the best model in the Dominican Republic. Other factors that have had a positive impact on the development of this hub include that the Dominican Republic is the main recipient of FDI in the Caribbean and Central America, amounting to 45% of all investment received in 2012. It also has a modern and efficient transportation network that enables expeditious and reliable cargo shipment and travel, as well as a excellent system of roads, nine international airports, several domestic terminals in important commercial locations, four cruise ports, and 12 modern cargo ports, including DP World Caucedo, one of the 25 largest ports in the world. The Dominican Republic also received more than 4.5 million visitors during 2012, generating revenues of more than $4.5 billion dollars. The Dominican Republic is leading as the number one tourism destination in the Caribbean. The cruise tourism field is an emerging sector. In 2012, the country received a total of 293 vessels and 338,170 passengers. Carnival is currently building and developing a touristic terminal in Puerto Plata, called the Amber Cove Cruise Terminal. Moreover, as the public sector, and for the development of efficient logistics management, we are acting nationwide, in accordance with a coordinated agenda, with priorities and common objectives, on the basis of strategic information that helps the definition of public policies and allows permanent control. With all these conditions as an structural foundation and guided by the clear and determinant decisions of the President of the Dominican Republic, HE Danilo Medina, the implementation of a strategy of multiple vectors, which includes the development of maritime infrastructure, financial free zones, tourism, merchant shipping, and air connectivity, the Dominican Republic is the preferred hub in the Caribbean.</p><h4>How do you evaluate the main drivers of the economy in Dominican Republic for the following years?</h4><p>In spite of the fact that, currently, international markets are undergoing some fluctuations caused mainly by uncertainty generated in a few developed economies, we can affirm the main economic drivers of the Dominican macroeconomic scenery suggest that we will have positive results in the medium term. According to the projections of Plan Nacional Plurianual del Sector Público 2013-2016, developed by the Ministry of Economy, Financial Planning, and Development, we can anticipate an annual average GDP growth of 4.5% during the analyzed period. Regarding employment, an average growth of 2.8% is expected by creating around 461,000 new jobs. Concerning inflation, it is projected that the Central Bank is going to maintain its fiscal policy position, preserving inflation targets, macroeconomic stability, and international reserves.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you plan to ensure that Tanzania's energy opportunities and resources are used for the country's benefit?<br></h4><p>When many people discuss natural resources they think about personal fortune, but in Tanzania our goal is for our natural resources to become a source of prosperity of all people in the country. Energy is the economic engine the world over. Development itself can be measured in terms of a nation's per capita energy consumption. Our economy is small; today, our GDP is at about $28 billion and our GDP per capita at around $600. As a nation, we have resolved to eradicate poverty and have devised a road map to do so. We are working toward a development vision for 2025, which involves becoming a middle-income country. Currently, our installed electricity capacity is 1,438.24 MW. Electricity is essential for growth, and our intention as a government is that by 2015, we will have doubled our installed capacity to 2,780 MW. We are determined to have a minimum generation capacity of 3,000 MW within the next three years. We have changed our energy profile; we were formerly highly dependent on hydropower, but climate change has taught us a major lesson. Therefore, the government today has a broader energy matrix, which is as follows: for the next five, 10, or even 20 years, our electricity will be generated first by natural gas, secondly by coal, thirdly by hydro-energy, and fourthly by renewable energies. For the latter, we will generate electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, and bioenergy. Tanzania is fortunate enough to have abundant generation resources. We have devised our energy matrix for economic reasons, as our economic growth oscillates between 6% and 7%. Our objective for the next two years is minimum growth of 8%. Economically, while this would actually result in a reduction in poverty, it would be insufficient to eradicate it. To do so requires double-digit growth. It should in fact exceed 10%, and preferably be at 12%, and must then remain at that level to enable the current GDP of about $28 billion to exceed $100 billion by the year 2025. This is all contingent upon a reliable power supply. We are currently constructing a pipeline that will help us generate substantially more power from natural gas. We are also starting plans to build new gas-fired power plants. We have learned over time that contrary to traditional thinking the government alone lacks the financial muscle to satisfy national energy demand. Our current approach, therefore, involves both public and private sector investments in a scheme that makes provision for three scenarios: public, private, and public-private. What we have at the moment is an enormous amount of energy, almost equivalent to 8 billion barrels of oil. Our small economy cannot consume all of our natural reserves, which spells export potential. We will use natural gas to propel the economy, to power our industries, and for domestic usage. We will use it in our vehicles and also as an input for fertilizer and other petrochemical industries. At the moment, we are discussing where to locate LNG facilities, and have already begun to engage the private sector in this process. Were an investor to express interest in the energy sector, we would be willing to accommodate them. There are others that would prefer to go into partnership with the government, and these are also invited. We are very open; there is no rigid approach or constraining legal framework. This is a very flexible and open approach, and the key issue here is negotiations with investors.</p><h4>How will the restructuring of TANESCO increase the availability of electricity for all Tanzanians?</h4><p>Restructuring TANESCO is obligatory for technical reasons. The predecessors of TANESCO were established during the colonial era. In 1931, during the British period, two companies based in Dar es Salaam formed a single power utility company. The contemporary TANESCO was established in 1964. You do not need to be a high-level professional to grasp what it means when from 1931 until today, only 21% of the country's population has access to electricity, despite our independence in 1964. This indicates that the structure of the national power utility is insufficient to accelerate the widespread availability of power. The second point is that TANESCO has accumulated substantial debt. If we are not careful, it will continue accumulating, and, thus, the issue must be urgently addressed. Since 100% of TANESCO's equity goes to the government those huge debts belong to the government and the people. We have decided as the government to clear these debts. We have to change our current approach; but this requires systemic change to prevent a return to the old problem. The third reason is that if our intention is to become a middle-income country, we must have an adequate, reliable, and predictable power supply. If from 1964 up to today, TANESCO can only generate 1,438 MW, it cannot take us much further toward being a middle-income country and needs restructuring. Economic, technical, and socioeconomic reasons compel us to do this. We have requested that TANESCO itself devise a proposal for a highly efficient, quality-driven organization. A second document is to be submitted by others at the ministry regarding their own perspective on change. A third and final proposal will be delivered by a consultant mandated by the African Development Bank. Tanzania's transmission systems are obsolete, while distribution and efficiency are poor, with a grid loss ratio of more than 20%. We cannot reduce this with the current TANESCO structure.</p><h4>How does science and technology accelerate growth of the energy and mining sectors and help you to focus on the 2025 goals?</h4><p>I am a geologist by profession, and I strongly believe that science has the solutions to the problems of global society. I recently told Parliament and the people of Tanzania that economic prosperity for the 21st century, and the subsequent century, has a very simple solution when you put it on paper. However, it is very hard to interpret and implement that equation. Our contemporary economic prosperity is the sum of science and technology, plus innovation, financial and human capital. These are the five obligatory ingredients for any country to become prosperous in our times, both today and tomorrow. Prosperity depends upon the absorption and implementation of knowledge, which in turn underpins innovation. This requires the support of adequate resources, finances, and human capital.</p><div class="quote">“  We are very open; there is no rigid approach or constraining legal framework.

We also identify natural and geologically related hazards that include earthquakes, volcanoes, and natural radiation from rocks, and offer advice to people on how best to mitigate these natural hazards. We also provide consultancy services to investors through our laboratory. Those interested in developing a certain area in Tanzania can request technical assistance in terms of exploration, mineral analysis, and the evaluation of geological commodities.</p><h4>How does Tanzania compare in its mineral wealth to neighboring countries?</h4><p>The country is made up of two main mineral units, including hydrocarbon rocks, which are endowed with solid mineral resources such as diamonds and gold, as well as many varieties of gemstones. Tanzania is the third largest gold producer in Africa, and is the sole producer of tanzanite in the world, as well as of other diverse types of minerals. Along the coast, we have sedimentary basins, the oldest containing excellent coal reserves. On the extreme eastern coast lie our mineral deposits where we have a huge accumulation of hydrocarbons, seemingly of the light hydrocarbon variety. We have plenty of gas, but only traces of liquid hydrocarbons. And yet liquid hydrocarbons lie beneath gas aquifers that cap the liquid hydrocarbons. I expect that during the course of tapping the gas, we would eventually have to raise the bottom levels of liquid hydrocarbons to the level of normal exploration programs. In short, I am not ruling out the presence of liquid hydrocarbons, but they would be beneath the gas hydrocarbons. I am very optimistic that when we begin harvesting the gas hydrocarbons we may indeed find liquid hydrocarbons. Regarding our neighboring countries, a number are comparable to Tanzania in terms of such diversity of wealth. Some have equal levels of minerals, but cannot match us in terms of liquid wealth, and so we have a special status in terms of hydrocarbon deposits. I think this puts us in a very strong competitive position, especially when it comes to attracting investors interested in mineral as well as hydrocarbon resources.</p><h4>Can you explain your current technology and the future innovations you anticipate?</h4><p>One distinct area involves the provision of geological mapping services. Most mineral deposits are not located on the surface, and some are very deep, which requires a different technique in order to identify the resources. The second consideration is that we are located in the tropics and, therefore, have a thick layer of soil cover, which presents major challenges to the visualization process. This means that we have to employ different techniques and technologies in the visualization process and for geological surveying. We take soil samples, identify them, and analyze them in terms of the remains of the deposits. The entire process requires sophisticated geological survey methods and technology. It entails sophisticated analytical methods in the laboratory, and explains our state of the art equipment. Different units have different signatures; some rocks are good conductors and some have a high magnetic attraction. Others have remnant magnetic attraction, where electricity is lost and magnetism observed, at which point we resort to specific equipment to assess magnetic variation. On occasion, the inadequate road system requires us to take readings by plane or helicopter in airborne geophysical surveys. Today, we are undertaking a large campaign aimed at improving the volume and coverage of geophysical surveys in order to better understanding central Tanzania.</p><h4>Tanzania has a set of Vision 2025 goals. How will the extractive industries fit into that vision and how can your organization help the country achieve them?</h4><p>New mines cannot be developed without our research, and no one can acquire a license without the information that we generate. This means that we are instigating investment, and by looking at the experiences of the recent past, Tanzania has moved from zero production in the early 1990s to being the third largest gold producer in Africa. The mineral industry is contributing over 50% of the growth, and solid profit level increases are being registered. All of these advances are being recorded as a result of detailed exploration, and these mines are only proving to be profitable because they have been heavily explored. As a result, we have devised a campaign of further exploration to discover untapped resources. We are already seeing some anomalies and believe that these may indeed yield results. I am sure that when we release the data at the end of 2013, we will have experienced some substantial growth in terms of investment and licensing. I think that this will lead to increased investment and subsequently more work for us; it will have a multiplier effect. Returning to the use of technology, infrastructure such as roads, as well as buildings and other structures are being built, and I think there is a need for a technical evaluation of the integrity of all foundations to ensure the long life of those structures. We are doing this through the World Bank project and are establishing a technical laboratory that will have the ability to investigate the quality of the bedrock in order to advise people on how safe the land that they are living on is, and also on such structures as telephone towers. Incidentally, our country also boasts good geological sites for tourism. We are publishing articles on geo-tourism; Kilimanjaro, for example, is one place that people cannot and should not overlook. Geology is not only there for the exploitation of minerals, but is also for the purpose of enjoyment and recreation. We are publishing articles on geological places of interest, describing them, and explaining their significance.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the company's history in Tanzania, and what are its current operations?<br></h4><p>The State Mining Corporation (STAMICO) was established in 1972 under the Public Corporation Act, 1969 and was tasked with developing the mining sector in Tanzania. At the time of establishment, STAMICO had 12 subsidiaries, several exploration projects, and mineral buying projects, particularly mica, gold, and cassiterite. The state at the time was the sole investor in the mining sector. From the late 1980s and early 1990s\ the economic policies of the country changed from centrally controlled to market oriented. This led to the enactment of the new Corporation Act of 1992 to replace the 1969 Act. Under the Public Corporation Act 1992, subsidiary companies under holding corporations like STAMICO were transferred to the Treasury Registrar. STAMICO's subsidiaries were also transferred to the Treasury Registrar from where they were privatized by the Presidential Sector Reform Commission (PSRC). The new policies paved the way for private sector-led mineral development. With the private sector having become the engine of development, the government decided to close STAMICO down in 1996. This move was made in anticipation that the state would benefit more from the private multinational mining companies that had started to flow into Tanzania and invest in the mining sector. Expectations were high. However, STAMICO was not immediately closed and survived through the provision of consultancy services to the private mining companies. The government subsequently appointed commissions to review the benefits accrued from the private mining sector. After a thorough review, the Bomani Commission recommended the participation of the state in mining ventures and the re-strengthening of STAMICO. Thus, in July 2008, the government rescinded its decision to close STAMICO, whereby in April 2009 it was officially despecified. These developments led to the passage of the Mining Act 2010, which clearly stipulates that the government should own shares in new mines through STAMICO, with the state stake to be negotiated on a project-to-project basis. With the new policies in place, the government redefined STAMICO's role as: investing in mining through exploration; holding government shares in new mines; the provision of technical (drilling) and consulting services; and the coordination of the transformation of the artisanal and small-scale mining sub-sector into regulated, environmentally friendly, safe, productive, and sustainable operations.</p><h4>What are some of STAMICO's largest domestic projects?</h4><p>One of STAMICO's roles concerns investment, which means acquiring exploration licenses, developing them, and entering joint ventures. At present, STAMICO's joint ventures include the Buckreef Gold Project in Geita, which is a joint venture between STAMICO and the Tanzanian Royalty Exploration Company of Canada. STAMICO holds a 45% stake, while its partner holds the remaining 55%. The joint venture company is currently conducting feasibility studies that are set for completion by 2015. Exploratory work done so far has delineated a resource of about 2 million ounces of gold and exploration is still in progress. The project includes 12 prospecting licenses and a mining license. Another joint venture project is the Buhemba Gold Project located in the Musoma Greenstone Belt. The project involves the reassessment and processing of old mine tailings and exploration in the license area in order to reopen the Buhemba mine closed in 2005. STAMICO is negotiating a joint venture with Australian company Manjaro Resources (Pty) Limited for this.</p><h4>STAMICO is to hold a 50% stake in TanzaniteOne. What are the details of this deal?</h4><p>Under the new Mining Act of 2010, licenses for gemstones are exclusively reserved for Tanzanian nationals. However, where such gemstone mining requires special techniques and huge financial outlay, Tanzanians may enter into joint ventures with foreigners to undertake gemstone mining. Tanzanite is in this category and the owners of the mine, TanzaniteOne, had to partner with a Tanzanian entity in compliance with the 2010 Mining Act. STAMICO was considered by TanzaniteOne as the best candidate to enter into a joint venture with.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the implications of the recently signed letter of intent for a 50-50 joint license ownership between Richmond and TanzaniteOne going forward?<br></h4><p>Philosophically, I have no problem with this, as the new world that is evolving is a different one from the past. There must be local involvement, which is in the business' own best interests. Some of these huge international companies are actually bigger than countries, and absolutely need to be part of the local DNA. If they aren't, and some fail to be, they risk becoming antibodies, whereby the political, economic, and social system rejects them. The problem I perceive, however, is how to achieve this in the national interest and also in the interest of investors. As with any other mineral activity, there is a need for capital investment, technology, and expertise. For locals, foreign investments enable the meeting of these requirements, thereby modernizing the gemstone industry. That being said, the necessary legislation has been passed curbing foreign participation to 50%. We had no option but to comply with it after failing with alternative options in the past in trying to involve Tanzanians, including the IPO route via the stock market. We have met the requirements of this law, however, and now the government, through STAMICO, has become our 50% partner. We also believe that the government will provide greater support for us as we face significant challenges, particularly in the security arena.</p><h4>Is the support you mention related to illegal mining activities?</h4><p>Yes, there is considerable illegal mining continuing unabated. We are the only sector in Tanzania that is transparent; we account for every stone and we're fully compliant with all our fiscal and environmental obligations. We fully expect this partnership to strengthen our hand and help modernize the sector.</p><h4>Why was 2012 was a difficult year for you?</h4><p>The losses in 2012 largely stemmed from illegal activities among our neighbors. We are totally compliant, but there is sadly a cost to compliance. We pay taxes and respect environmental, labor, and fiscal rules and regulations, while at the same time playing in a market against illegal competitors that acknowledge no such costs or compliance issues. They can sell a stone for $0.50, whereas the cost of a stone I produce comes to a dollar, and yet we sell on the same market. The result is that Tanzania is a source of tanzanite with no formal tanzanite industry. In fact, the only formalized tanzanite company is my company.</p><h4>What are the biggest markets for tanzanite today and where is the biggest growth in demand?</h4><p>For many years, it's been North America, especially the US. We have sold in Europe, but over the past few years we've been looking eastward, opening an outlet in Dubai. We are now focused on the Far East, particularly China, which is where we observe the largest demand, underpinned by a fast growing middle and upper class .</p><h4>Can you tell us about TanzaniaOne's “preferred supply strategy," which is a world first in the colored gemstone market?</h4><p>While in the past we solely focused on producing and mining the stone, today, with our preferred supply strategy, we are involved in the entire process, from mining the stone to delivering it to the market. We have gone about this in a number of ways. Firstly, we pioneered adapting diamond industry technology to the gemstone business. This makes us perhaps the most modern company in gemstone mining. Secondly, we operate with eight distribution partners, and this underlines our commitment to a solid global network enabling us to efficiently reach consumers. Our consumers and clients know that when they buy our product, they're buying a legal product from a company in full legal compliance from regulatory to labor quality, environmental standards, and best practices. People know that if their stone comes from TanzaniteOne, their conscience is clear. Our products benefit our country and its communities. Thirdly, we focus on price stability. We are less focused on the level of prices than on their stability, and on stable supply. Jewelers should confidently promote a stone that they know will be available, be it here or in Dubai, or in China or the US. Fourthly, we've created an online boutique, TanzaniteOne Online, to showcase our efforts.</p><h4>What do you think is needed for the tanzanite industry to grow in the future?</h4><p>I think we basically need three things: compliance, compliance, and compliance. Companies have to comply with rules and regulations, and with the necessary legislation, and have to enforce those standards. We at TanzaniteOne have done this, as a result of which we've recently won six industry awards in different categories.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the mission of the Tanzania Commission of Science &amp; Technology (COSTECH)?<br></h4><p>was established in 1984 with the goal of advising the government on science, technology, and innovation. Our core function is to promote and coordinate research and technology development and transfer, as well as to acquire, store, and disseminate scientific information to diverse audiences. Our mission is to ensure that the country is using science and technology innovation to contribute to its economic growth and social well being.</p><h4>What are some of the programs that are in action today?</h4><p>In terms of trying to promote science, technology, and innovation in the country, we have a number of activities and have arranged them into strategic objectives. One of them is to promote informed decisions. We are a broker between research institutions and universities that generate knowledge and technology. We also assess which types of technology have the potential to make a significant impact on the country. COSTECH is working to create an environment conducive to the application of ICT in different sectors. Within that effort, we also promote innovation. Our organization is a platform where individuals with passion and entrepreneurial skills in ICT meet to discuss ideas. For example, Maxmalipo is now expanding its business to Burundi, Rwanda, and South Sudan, and is one of our start-up companies. The aim is to encourage entrepreneurs, graduates, and people of potential to become job creators rather than seekers. We are also the custodians of science and technology and issue grants to research projects. As you know, the country depends on agriculture as a main sector of the economy, and it contributes around 25% of GDP. If you look at the annual growth of the sector, it is still very low at only about 4%—it can't be compared with communications, which is posting 21% annual growth. The issue is to boost the sector to continue increasing productivity and making a much bigger impact in the provision of food toward a point of self-sufficiency. In order to make a contribution to those efforts, we are funding a number of research projects. We are also funding over 250 Master's degrees and PhD training courses through our own investments. All of this has been achieved because, in 2011, the President placed emphasis on science and technology. He is also ensuring that the government provides adequate funding for research. Tanzania is historically at the best level in scientific terms thanks in large part to strong presidential endorsement of science and technology, backed by the allocation of resources to R&amp;D.</p><h4>How can technology benefit citizens who still lack access to electricity, hence the means to reach modern technology?</h4><p>We are looking at technology that is affordable for our country. Previously, people used to talk about appropriate technology—one interpretation is cheaper and affordable, but which is not of high quality. What we would ideally like to have is technology that is state of the art and affordable for all people. The cost of communications has fallen substantially. Due to competition, the presence of the ICT backbone pushed up all related prices, although the quality of services remains the same. We would like to have technology for more people at a lower cost. In energy, we have talked about the penetration rates of technology used in rural areas, and I believe that electricity coverage may be less than 10% of the national grid. Most of the people in rural areas depend on biomass. One question is; how can we use biomass technologies more sustainably? The second is how we can leverage renewable energy, such as wind and biofuel? This said, we are expecting gas to push down some of the costs and become widely available. Nonetheless, biomass fuel remains the cornerstone in rural areas.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 2012, Tanzania finally reached the long-sought goal of welcoming over 1 million visitors. What were the biggest factors in finally reaching this target?<br></h4><p>Tanzania has continued to be a very stable country politically. When talking about general safety and security, we have been fortunate. We are one of the few countries in Africa that has not seen any unrest or instability. This has been a huge milestone with regard to winning the trust of visitors worldwide. Secondly, Tanzania has continued to enjoy the limelight with many international leaders, notably American and European, coming over to Tanzania. Tanzania is seen predominantly as a safari destination, and our assets, ranked second after Brazil in terms of beauty and abundance, are predominantly the wildlife. This has given us considerable leverage that has fueled 24% growth in tourism over the past year from 870,000 visitors to over 1 million.</p><h4>How are you balancing the need for conservation with your vision to make tourism the largest contributor to GDP?</h4><p>Technology will play a part. First of all, we should have an arrangement where people can book well in advance. Also, we want to diversify beyond from exiting parks such as the Serengeti and Ngorongoro by developing new zones in remoter areas. The southern part of the country has some beautiful destinations, such as Ruaha National Park, a future icon. One problem is the shortage of accommodation facilities in the south. Tanzania National Parks (TANAPA) has concluded an investment prospectus identifying designated tracts of land to be leased to investors. There are several plots that will be available for investment in Ruaha and Katavi national parks. Likewise, Selous, which is a game reserve under a different jurisdiction, still has plots available for investors. The Southern Circuit boasts great potential, and we appreciate outstanding challenges regarding infrastructure, which are being addressed. However, product diversification is also possible, and the idea of developing beach tourism is something the President has particularly emphasized. Currently, the Ministry is drafting policy aimed at exploiting our 804 kilometers of coastline by creating tourist resorts. Some plots will belong to the government, while others attract private ownership.</p><h4>The Tanzania Tourist Board (TTB) has a vision to make tourism the number one contributor to GDP by 2025. What are the main tasks that you as TTB will have to do to achieve this?</h4><p>There are a number of interventions that will be required. I would categorize them under product development, accessibility, and information dissemination. Product development includes infrastructure development to try and promote beach tourism by allowing new investments in those areas. There is also the business of events and conventions. By building facilities such as the Julius Nyerere International Conference Center, we attract related events. We want to expand tourism a wider audience. With regards to accessibility, while the government is doing everything possible to develop a strong airline, we are waiting for international airlines, too. We have a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Ethiopian Airlines and we are just about to conclude a MoU with Qatar Airways. It is assisting us in facilitating travel from different parts of the world into not only Dar es Salaam, but Kilimanjaro as well, which has been underserved. Turkish Airlines also now flies directly from Istanbul. As for the promotional campaigns, we pursue specific strategies in fewer markets instead of spreading ourselves too thin, including our traditional markets, as well as emerging ones, notably the BRICs. In addition, we are currently proposing a transformation of TTB from being just a promoter to being an actual authority.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you balance market liberalization and protectionism in your regulatory approach?<br></h4><p>From the regulatory perspective, we need to exercise cautious and be balanced. That has been the approach taken by Tanzania. Capital account liberalization is a Bank of Tanzania issue, but, being in the financial sector, it affects us as well. For example, Tanzanians cannot buy shares in a foreign country unless they have obtained a source of finance from outside the country. That is certainly restrictive for us. In addition, on the capital markets side, we are working toward being more cautious during our build-up phase, because there are certain restrictions. For example, foreigners can own a maximum of 60% of a company's shares, especially those subject to privatization. In the event that Tanzanians are able to cover more than 40%, priority will be given to them; the philosophy is to empower local businesspeople. However, it has been over 15 years since we began operations, and we find that there is demand to open up further. The brokers are receiving orders from abroad from people who want to buy shares of companies that are listed on the stock exchange, but they face the 60% cap. We are heeding that call and have agreed that we should open up the market. We are participating in proposals on how to liberalize the accounts. The CMSA is going to be part of a gradual process that should open up the market by 2015.</p><h4>What new capital market products are you introducing?</h4><p>The idea of introducing an enterprise growth market came about due to the perceived the lack of liquidity. There are very few companies listed on the exchange, so we conducted a study to see why. We interviewed a number of potential issuers, went outside the country, and concluded that we needed another segment of the market with different listing requirements. That is how we came up with the idea of having a second tier in the market, and we named it “the enterprise growth market." We didn't want to portray the idea that one segment was a lesser entity, but instead championed the idea of having a different segment for alternative kinds of issuers. We have devised the regulatory framework, and recently completed training for nominated advisors. There are entities that we hope will be able to seek out companies keen to issue shares to the public and then nurture them for public offer and eventual listing. The enterprise growth market is essentially designed for startups, SMEs, or companies that have no track record. They are companies in which the promoters have good ideas but lack funds. We are giving them the opportunity to source funding through the capital markets and also providing an exit mechanism for those people willing to take risks.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to encourage the free flow of capital?</h4><p>Capital markets regulators in East Africa started working on integration issues long ago. We started in 1996 by forming the East Africa Securities Regulators forum. It comprised Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya, but has since expanded to include Rwanda and Burundi. Even in the East African community, people use Tanzania as a role model. We have achieved harmonization to facilitate advancement, as embodied by the integrated regulatory framework. We have a number of harmonized regulations, with one resulting in the cross listing of securities. There are companies that are cross-listed in four countries, with Burundi the only exception since it lacks both a stock exchange and regulator. We have implemented legislation in the regulatory framework that has been harmonized, and we recently developed a requirement for the issuance of regional bonds.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Since the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE) began trading in 1998, what changes has it brought about in the business environment in Tanzania?<br></h4><p>The establishment of the DSE in 1998 was part of a broader government initiative to move from a state-owned economy to a market-oriented one. A large part of that was the privatization of government-owned entities, which led to the subsequent impetus to establish a bourse. This allowed the country to widen the ownership of those companies. Seven companies that have been privatized through the stock exchange rank among the top taxpayers in the country. Their performance is solid in terms of revenue, profitability, tax payment, and efficient employment. There are also four private companies listed on our stock exchange. There are 11 domestic listed companies and six cross-listed entities. These are the companies that are listed on other stock exchanges, five on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, and one on the London Stock Exchange. In total, we have 17 listed companies. Our total market capitalization today is around TZS14 trillion ($8.5 billion). All government bonds are also listed on our market. Once issued in the primary market at the Bank of Tanzania, they are listed on our exchange to provide a platform for investors to exit if they want, and for others to enter. We also have some corporate bonds, which corporate entities use to raise capital. They each cooperate with the investment community and become listed on the exchange to allow the entry and exit of those bonds as well.</p><h4>The exchange has been quite successful in recent years, with market capitalization doubling between May 2011 and May 2012. Going forward, how can the exchange continue to see strong and stable growth and provide a positive investment environment?</h4><p>Market capitalization doubled because we cross-listed African Barrick Gold, a sizable company. If you exclude that, the investment community has a solid appetite. The attractiveness of the supply side in terms of products and the availability of products traded here are the main reasons why market capitalization is growing in terms of the prices of listed securities. If you look at some counters, especially for some of those that I have just mentioned, the prices almost doubled when you compare 2012 to today. TCC, Swissport, TBL, NMB, and Twiga Cement almost doubled in growth over that period. That was prompted by the good financial performance of those companies in terms of revenue, the efficient use of their resources, both financial and human, and as a result of relatively good profitability and dividends payments, which is also key for investors. Of the top 15 top taxpayers in Tanzania, seven are listed here in our market. That indicates that if you prioritize bringing a company into the stock exchange, with all the benefits that go with it, including transparency, disclosure, and efficiencies, it provides better results for the company, with the wider economy benefiting too, the government included. For long-term capital growth, we would like private enterprises, including small, medium, and large companies to make use of the stock exchange, be it for debt or equity capital raising, or to finance their long-term growth and development. We are taking initiatives to incentivize such companies to participate.</p><h4>At what stage are the current discussions regarding an integrated East African force including the Ugandan Securities Exchange, the Nairobi Securities Exchange, and the DSE?</h4><p>We are part of the East African Stock Exchanges Association (EASEA). We are implementing protocols that have been signed by our heads of government and the ministries directed at this integration process. There are a variety of initiatives that are in different stages of being implemented, but as country and a stock exchange we are part of that initiative. Part of the equation is to allow the free movement of capital among the stock exchanges. For Tanzania to achieve that, we need to change our capital account, at least partially, to allow Tanzanians to invest in East Africa and East Africans to invest here as if they were local investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been done to ensure the insurance industry continues to grow and meet market demand?<br></h4><p>The growth of any insurance industry depends mainly on two or three factors. One is that you have the right regulatory framework in place, meaning that people who wish to invest in the market are confident that their investments will be protected. The second factor is the policyholders themselves. If they feel that the company will be there to pay their claims, more people will purchase insurance once they feel the investment is stable and protected. Another factor that determines growth is the economy itself. If a country's economy is doing well, the insurance sector will also do well.</p><h4>Are regulations in place to protect consumer products?</h4><p>Every company or investor in this market has to comply with regulations and legal requirements. You need an adequate amount of capital to channel into the business, and the right staff to run it. Our office supervises market conduct, as well as the prudential fitness of the companies operating in it. We are there to make sure that these businesses are there to pay claims and honor the obligations and promises they make to their customers. These are the criteria ensuring that those that want to buy insurance, or invest in this kind of business, can be confident of their return at the end of the day.</p><h4>What is being done to increase insurance penetration?</h4><p>Our penetration rate is at 1%, which is common, given that we are a developing market. Most of the emerging markets range between 1% and 2%, and below 3%. One reason for such low penetration is the culture itself, because insurance is something that you have to believe in. It is a consideration the benefits of which require visibility to be trusted and depended upon. In Tanzania, we do not have a savings culture like in Japan or India. There, the savings ratio to GDP is around 16%, whereas in a country like ours the percentage is no more than 5%. The lack of education and awareness is another factor curbing our penetration levels. Poverty is another major issue. To be able to consume insurance, you need disposable income. And naturally, if you are living within or below the poverty line, you have none. These are the factors that have been affecting the penetration ratio of insurance in Tanzania as a percentage of GDP.</p><h4>Which sector is set to see the highest growth?</h4><p>We want to grow the life sector because we believe it is capable of determining insurance penetration more easily, and can generate and channel more savings for investment. The life sector can also develop when the investment vehicles in or around the country are yielding a return. This enables you to assure the consumer that a life product will bring a return on investment. The products we are selling inevitably address the issue of death. However, we want to introduce products that also underline the concepts of saving and investment such as unit-linked policies. With these products, when someone buys life cover, the money paid as a premium on a monthly basis is attached to a certain investment. That investment is also listed on the stock exchange. Profits made are returned to the life policy.</p><h4>What is your vision for the Tanzanian insurance market for the next five-to-10 years?</h4><p>We believe in insurance just as people believe in banking, or other financial services. Through these vehicles, countries will be able to address the issues of poverty reduction and wealth creation. We want insurance to become a tool toward that end, which is where the issue of micro insurance comes in. Low-income citizens need to be able to improve their lives through micro insurance products, and micro insurance is now on the agenda of every meeting that we attend on this continent. Countries like India and Bangladesh were able to emerge from poverty through micro finance and micro insurance.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the structure of Tanzania's social security system and your role in regulating it?<br></h4><p>Social security in Tanzania follows a three-pillar approach, with the first dealing with the social assistance system, financed by taxes. The second pillar is contributory, and contains the pension funds, which are the National Social Security Fund (NSSF), the Parastatal Pensions Fund (PPF), the Public Service Pensions Fund (PSPF), and the Local Authorities Pensions Fund (LAPF). We also have one provident fund, called the Government Employees Provident Fund (GEPF). On this pillar, we have the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF). These all rest on mandatory schemes established by an act of parliament. The third pillar supports nascent supplementary schemes, and occupational-based ones established by trust deeds. Today, we simply have a social system in place dominated by the Mandatory Defined Benefits Schemes. Regarding the first pillar, although the government offers social assistance to vulnerable groups, the country has not established a universal pension. The Social Security Regulatory Authority (SSRA) and the Ministry of Labor and Employment are working to introduce a universal pension for the elderly. Among SSRA's roles is the regulation  of the sector, awareness building of social security products and services, and regular monitoring of sector performance.</p><h4>What is the current coverage ratio?</h4><p>The coverage ratio is around 3.6% of the population, and roughly 6.5% of the working population. Limited coverage stems from sectorial membership, a lack of awareness of social security products, inadequate benefits, lack of transferability, and premature withdrawals.</p><h4>Since 2011, what changes have you seen in the market?</h4><p>The most significant, in 2012, was a comprehensive overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework of the Acts of all existing mandatory social security schemes to comply with the Social Security Regulatory (SSR) Act. Transparency has increased as schemes inform members of their operations at annual conferences, boosting awareness. SSRA, in collaboration with the Bank of Tanzania, has issued uniform investment guidelines for all pension funds, raising good governance in fund management. The funds' assets, originally at around TZS3.7 trillion, exceeded TZS5.2 trillion in 2012. Current legislation imposes a penalty for avoidance, or delayed payment of contributions. The turnaround time has been improved from two months to one to two weeks, depending on the fund. Another innovative step has been an amendment to the SSR Act that allows 50% of contributions to be collateralized for mortgages. We know that the notion of social security traditionally implies waiting until retirement; however, our members are keen to secure their future beforehand.</p><h4>What has led to substantial growth in premiums?</h4><p>The first factor is the harmonized legal and regulatory framework. The second is enforcement; every employee is registered with a mandatory social security scheme and employers must pay timely contributions. The SSRA protects members against employer non-payment. The third factor is investment guidelines, which have increased prudent fund management.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>With recent gas finds in Tanzania, what pace and form of growth should the country ideally adopt?<br></h4><p>Projects of this magnitude must be conducted at an effective pace. Both this country and its neighbors have made huge gas discoveries, which need to be appraised by additional drilling and well testing. Information gained during that process could also potentially be used to find gas in other areas. That's the first step. These gas discoveries are in very deep water, meaning related appraisal activities are quite challenging. We must carefully prepare for them and assimilate information from the original discoveries, as well as obtain additional seismic data. BG is looking to conduct further exploration and drill appraisal wells here in 2013, and we may take the decision to do more in 2014. Once we have that information, we need to feed it into the engineering setup in terms of pre-feed work and then carry out further detailed engineering and design work. In doing so, we must ensure that the commercial structure is appropriate and that our market projections for the product we wish to sell, in this case liquefied natural gas (LNG), are stable and in high demand worldwide as the price of the product and overall infrastructure cost will determine the manner in which we then proceed. That process in itself, we envisage, will take at least four years. There is absolutely nothing that we can do, or should do, to speed up the process. If you try to push progress along too quickly, errors can be made in design or market and cost projections, meaning that the investment may not be a fruitful one. We are guests here, and our advice to our hosts is to proceed cautiously to ensure that an investment of this magnitude is conducted in an appropriate fashion for all concerned.</p><h4>What considerations will need to be made at the investment stage?</h4><p>Once we get to the investment decision stage, which we are attempting to achieve in collaboration with Statoil and ExxonMobil, which discovered gas in Block 2, the construction of an LNG plant or plants on a site with all related upstream infrastructure will require a further four to five years. The benefits of deep-water gas to Tanzania will not show themselves in terms of substantial revenue until the next decade. To go any faster would not utilize the country's resources effectively. Because of the parameters set by a billion-dollar investment, the project cannot be approached in an abstract way. A project like this, with all its technological challenges, needs time. Some of the gas discoveries in very deep water use technology that has only recently granted us access to it. This means that Tanzania has time to develop its infrastructure, legislative framework, and regulatory bodies, as well as prepared its workforce for participation in this venture. I believe that the Minister of Energy and Minerals is heading in the right direction in terms of scholarships and the number of people being trained. I have been on the ground since January 2013, and my proudest moment will be when, in late June to early July, we hire three young Tanzanians as part of our graduate program; they will be the first of many. We also provide scholarships and funding. There is nothing more important than bringing people into your space and having them learn on the ground. I do believe that the biggest challenge for Tanzania in terms of project success is that it requires all sides, including the people, the government, and guests like ourselves, to work collaboratively in the developing of strengths, right from primary school through to high school and university. If we do that, the country will be in a better position to benefit from its resources. Building an energy plant and drilling in 2,500 meters of water is tough, but getting a country to produce outstanding engineers over a long period of time who will stay within the country to contribute effectively is a much more challenging task.</p><h4>What partnerships are you developing in the country?</h4><p>We are partnered with Ophir Energy in Blocks 1, 3, and 4, while Statoil and ExxonMobil are in Block 2. What we have is collaboration in principle to hopefully partner with Statoil and ExxonMobil. We are working well together. We are of course also partners with Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and for all intents and purposes, the government and people of Tanzania.</p><div class="quote">“  We are partnered with Ophir Energy in Blocks 1, 3, and 4, while Statoil and ExxonMobil are in Block 2. "</div><h4>How do you foresee the demand for LNG developing?</h4><p>BG Group's belief is that the demand for gas in the next decade will outstrip supply, and there are several reasons for this. First is the demand projection in the Far East and elsewhere, and second is the ability of today's LNG ships to exploit markets worldwide. Even with a recent dampening of demand in China, we still see considerable opportunities. This means that prices will be extremely robust. From Tanzania's perspective, under the terms of the production-sharing agreements (PSAs), investment risk lies with the contractor; we provide the upfront investment capital. Obviously, we are using the resources of Tanzania so it is essential that we frame our work in a manner beneficial to the country. However, given how the deals are structured, Tanzanians will still get an appropriate share even in times of lower prices. It is essential for a resource belonging to a country to be exploited appropriately. When we go to the TPDC, we present convincing data as evidence of why LNG remains the optimum utilization of deep-water gas in terms of return per molecule of gas. In regard to the East African region, there are also huge gas reserves in Mozambique. I do not see this as a problem; in fact, I believe that many synergies could be developed in terms of expertise and other forms of collaboration. As we develop capacity here, we have to ensure that that it is not sucked elsewhere. In that respect, the right institutional arrangements have to be in place to encourage businesses to remain in the country.</p><h4>What benefits will a gas industry bring to the country?</h4><p>A gas industry, which of course is part of the overall energy program, brings cutting-edge technology to a country. In terms of the depth that rigs have to drill to, as well as the seismic information we have on the seabed, it is amazing. There are literally grand canyons under water off Tanzania's shores that we have mapped. With such expertise come technological advances, which if managed carefully, can have a knock-on effect on the economy. The country itself begins thinking about its engineering capacities and the universities start to think about how best to drive the industry and become a part of it—it starts a thought process on whether more engineers are needed, and on the scholarships, or laboratories that might be necessary to develop them, for example. Such intellectual discussions do not just simply happen. Discussion brings about change, which is the key to development.</p><h4>How do you feel about the Tanzanian business environment and existing challenges?</h4><p>The energy industry remains in its developmental stage. I believe that even when gold prices were high, the maximum revenue from Tanzania's extractive industries per annum was circa $500 million per year. The potential benefits of a deep-water gas development dwarf that. Secondly, the requisite investment in deep-water gas developments can range into the billions of dollars. Preparing for the impact this will have on the economy is challenging in terms of the influx of goods and utilization of foreign exchange, and in avoiding hyperinflation. From a governmental perspective, such issues require careful evaluation. Moreover, the service economy must also develop in step with massive national changes. The issue of permits should also be well considered; you don't want a scenario where people commit to huge investments only to face regulatory obstacles.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>You very recently acquired a 12% stake in Block 6 with Shell and Petrobras pending Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) approval. What are your expectations for this acquisition, assuming it is approved?<br></h4><p>That acquisition should be seen in the context of our plans for Tanzania becoming a regional foothold. We have high expectations for the region, and our commitment in staying here is clear from this acquisition.</p><h4>These developments are bringing Tanzania onto the world stage as an energy player. What will further discoveries mean for the country?</h4><p>It will of course have a potentially positive contribution to national development, given its aspirations of becoming a medium-sized economy by 2025. I think that the energy sector could be a cornerstone in achieving this. I am not suggesting that oil and gas should dominate the economy, but it will at least be a key contributor. It is a matter of timing; the discoveries that we have made now, and those made in the blocks around us, will require several years before the country generates revenue. It will certainly require patience.</p><h4>Given the experience you have in various regions, how does Tanzania's regulatory environment compare, particularly with regard to energy exploration and energy contracts?</h4><p>I think Tanzania will benefit from the gas policy plans that have already been disclosed, which clearly state that the role of TPDC requires modification. The country foresees a split between the regulatory and operational components of the national oil company. I consider this an absolute must, where there is actually is a split between the regulatory body and the operational branch of the national oil company. I think that it is essential for that transition to be efficiently executed, and to ensure that gas is extracted, produced, and managed, to the benefit of the Tanzanian people, state, and nation. Thus far the right things are being said, but of course the proof will be in the doing when it comes to the execution of this policy, and when it takes the form of gas acts or other regulatory and legislative decisions.</p><h4>Overall, 2012 and 2013 have seen some impressive results in Zafarani, Lavani, and Tangawizi in Block 2. What are your plans for the near future?</h4><p>We recently reinitiated our drilling activities, whereupon the Discoverer Americas drill ship from Transocean entered Tanzanian waters recently and we have resumed operations, which we will continue for a further 12 months or possibly more, depending on the initial success levels. There will be a combined appraisal and exploration activities; appraisal of the already identified finds that we have as a means of framing the commercial part of the potential LNG development so that we have greater confidence in the resources, which we have already discovered. We are also planning additional exploration activities within the block. Based on our discoveries, we estimate that there could be about 15 to 17 tcf of resources or gas in-place volumes, or, depending on how you do the arithmetic; it could have a potential reserve base of 11 tcf. Basic rules of thumb from the LNG world mean you will probably end up with very close to sufficient resources for a two-train solution. Our neighbors are somewhere in the same order of magnitude so you can almost double up to reach the numbers. However, we are still in early days and haven't even reached our final conclusion for defined commerciality. That is one step that will follow very shortly, after which comes the concept selection, and then the detailed engineering, which will tell us whether a final investment is feasible. The final investment decision may emerge as late as 2017.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How can Tanzania's mineral wealth generate maximum benefits for the country?<br></h4><p>We amended the 1997 mineral policy in 2009 to ensure a thriving mining sector. The new Mining Act of 2010 prioritized national benefit from mining activities. The 1997 policy, had not made provision for much government involvement, and we decided that this had to change to allow for government participation in investment, and today the State Mining Company (STAMICO) invests in the mining sector on behalf of the government. Accordingly, section 10 of the Mining Act of 2010 stipulated a government stake be held in domestic mining ventures. In addition, investments exceeding $100 million require a special mining license. At that level, they also qualify to enter into a mining development agreement with the government that aims to stabilize the fiscal package. In such projects, the government must also hold a stake. The process is one of negotiation, whereby the state receives some shares and purchases others.</p><h4>Minister Muhongo has revealed his plan to increase the mining sector's contribution to GDP from around 3.5% to 10%. What policies will ensure this growth?</h4><p>By 2025, we aim to have realized this goal, and there are various measures that must be taken to achieve it. As mentioned, the government will hold a stake in all new projects. This is to ensure that STAMICO is participating in investment, and that the country at large is benefiting from the mining sector. We also need to fully integrate the sector with the broader economy. Today, mining companies procure food, services, and goods locally to maximize the benefits for Tanzania. We encourage local participation in the mining sector by providing government support, which also builds human capacity among the local population. We assist businesses in the mining sector with finance and training. We have also mandated that all mining companies register on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange, whereby locals can purchase stock there and retain further revenue in the local economy. The new act also eases the business environment in many ways. For example, it grants specific licenses for smelting and other areas.</p><h4>How does technology and knowledge transfer influence the mining industry?</h4><p>These elements are crucial. Our efforts at restructuring the small-scale mining industry depend on the acquisition of new processes. Currently, small-scale mining is a dangerous venture with a negative impact on the environment, and we are keen to institute public-private partnerships (PPPs) to address this. We foresee certain state quotas, while partnerships would provide essential equipment and technology to increase yields in pursuit of overall profitability. As far as knowledge transfer is concerned, having well-trained professionals from abroad working here provides numerous advantages. Gem stones are currently only cut in certain countries, but we have restricted the export of raw tanzanite such that the cutting can only be done here.  Currently, expert cutters are already here teaching Tanzanians this valuable skill. Meanwhile, copper smelting is a growing industry, and we have assembled better technology, smelters, and experts locally within a very short timeframe.</p><h4>What aspect of the mining sector offers the greatest growth potential?</h4><p>Gold has been our dominant export for some time—we are the third largest gold producer in Africa and have a number of major mines. We also have nickel in several mines such as Kabanga and Dutwa in central Tanzania, and other prospects. Uranium is another project, which may elevate Tanzania above Canada as the largest uranium exporter in the world after Kazakhstan. However, global demand is shifting toward base metals such as iron, copper, and nickel, and in the future we will develop these further. Coal is in high demand, and our mining sector is diversifying rapidly. Minerals contribute 50% of our total foreign currency inflows, of which gold accounts for over 90%.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania's mobile market is growing at an incredible rate. What role has the Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) played in facilitating that growth?<br></h4><p>The growth has been exponential. Right now, there are about 27 million SIM cards in the market. Yet, back in 2000, there were 284,000  and in 2004 there a mere 2 million. The regulatory framework has made this possible by allowing competition, which has played a great role in growth. We have over five active operators, including Vodacom, Airtel, Tigo, ZANTEL, and TTCL Mobile, as well as Sasatel and Benson Informatics. Competition is crucial and cannot thrive without a strong regulatory framework. Our framework is highly conducive to encouraging competition and our regulations highly detailed in terms of quality of service, consumer protection, and tariffs, amongst other considerations. I should also mention our licensing framework: the Converged Licensing Framework, which is technology and service neutral. There are four licenses; the first is the highly detailed Network Facility License for construction of communication infrastructure, be it wireless, fiber optics, towers, or other. There have recently been several major developments in this area, such as the landing of submarine cables in Dar es Salaam. Second, there is the Network Services License for the provision of voice, video, and data services. Third, there is the Application Services License, which is open-ended and includes internet provision, mobile banking, and other applications. Fourth, there is the Content Service License, which concerns radio and television, with digital broadcasting being the key focus in this area today. ICT policies have also been instrumental in growth in recent years.</p><h4>How, as a regulator, do you structure a framework conducive to new innovation?</h4><p>The Application Service License is deliberately very open-ended. If an operator comes to us with a new value added service or product, we do not require separate licenses, but merely an additional appendix to an existing one. In 2004, it was impossible to browse the internet on your mobile phone here. However, in 2005 we introduced a converged licensing framework, which included several types of license. In terms of financial transactions, for example, institutions require central bank authorization, but in using the communications network they obtain authorization from the TCRA through application services licenses.</p><h4>Regulation-wise, how does Tanzania compare to its neighbors?</h4><p>The converged licensing framework was introduced in 2005, and many countries in the region have adopted the idea in other licensing frameworks.</p><div class="quote">“  We have over five active operators, including Vodacom, Airtel, Tigo, ZANTEL, and TTCL Mobile, as well as Sasatel and Benson Informatics."</div><h4>In terms of the goals for Tanzania's Development (Vision 2025), how do you plan to foster a greater level of technology, innovation, and competition?</h4><p>Our people have identified priorities such as agriculture, education, health, water, and transport among others. However, the issue in the ICT sector is crosscutting. In education, students can use ICT to facilitate learning. In health, telemedicine is set to gain importance thanks to its capacity to, say, enable a doctor to remotely direct an operation. In agriculture, it is also important, as it allows farmers to learn the price of goods electronically, and much more. There are priorities, but ICT has a crucial crosscutting role.</p><h4>What challenges does the ICT sector face?</h4><p>An example is cyber-security, which is a global dilemma. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) will be a unit dedicated to tackling cyber threats to all major stakeholders, such as mobile companies, banks, the police, and critical infrastructure including energy, water, transport, and so on. Another challenge is to combat the misuse of ICT, an example being individuals or companies generating unwanted SMS messages. To deal with this, we are introducing SIM registration. We also need to be more vigilant in content regulation for radio and television. There is a need for balance between freedom of speech, privacy, and security. The internet is a good tool that can be used in education and many other fields, but one that can also be misused. This is true for all ICTs, and there is need to promote peaceful uses for social and economic development.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you conserve Tanzania's natural and cultural resources while enlarging the tourism sector?</h4><p>Over the past year, while visiting many establishments in the areas where tourism is thriving, I have noted that conservation is key. For example, people such as Paul Tudor Jones, who has maintained an amazing part of the Serengeti for years, are working to support the cause. The kind of conservation work that he has done and the type of wildlife present in that area are very different from what can been seen in other areas of the national park. There are other examples of investors interested in this area that are promoting tourism and conservation. In those areas, the grass is green and the wildlife is plentiful and diverse. To my thinking, private investors do very well in terms of conservation. They provide facilities for the area and use their own money to protect it. In the case of Paul Tudor Jones, he is subject to a quota for the amount of wildlife he can hunt, be it lions, elephants, or zebras—but he never hunts. He is one of the best, and an excellent exampleof the kind of investor we appreciate. I believe that it is important to have people who invest in tourism while simultaneously helping to conserve it. Paul Tudor Jones has his own client base of tourists, with a number of them being celebrities who invest and promote tourism. They inject funds that go toward policing the areas with anti-poaching measures, thereby helping the government to promote preservation of the flora and fauna.</p><h4>How is technology used in tourism and the conservation of natural resources?</h4><p>In our national parks and other game control areas, technology is extremely important. This is because when tourists visit the area, they are likely to bring their iPads, Androids, or other tablets. Tourists prefer the option of immediately being online with their loved one, often through email. Therefore, we have to ensure that internet service is available as it offers comfort and assurance to visitors. We have invested heavily, but tourists still tell us that the service could improve. The President has instructed the national parks to make communications easier, more affordable, and more accessible. I am in touch with the Minster of Communications, Science, and Technology to discuss this issue and work on catering to tourists' needs. And this is an area that I consider essential as far as tourism is concerned. Tourists, for example, want to check their flights, contact airlines or hotels, and make bookings, and we have to provide internet access from wherever they are. This kind of technological communication, where people can rely on access to information, pictures, and so forth, needs more investment. On another level, the residents of surrounding villages would also benefit from better technology.</p><h4><br>Do you use technology to promote tourism?</h4><p>This is something that has not yet been implemented. The department that deals with communications still lacks the skilled staff required to undertake the task. It would be useful to coordinate with TENAPA, which deals with the national parks, and the Ngorongoro Conservation Authority Area, which is equally important. This is the best way to promote Tanzania as a tourist destination and the attractions that we have. Activity in this area would certainly open up new ground.</p><h4><br>What would be your ideal relationship with foreign investors?</h4><p>In the past, the business community perceived the government as its enemy. Today, we are aggressively working to reverse that perception. My philosophy is very simple—the government cannot do business, and especially in a delicate sector like tourism. There are plenty of people with the resources to steer the industry, and the government's role should be to ensure that the appropriate laws and regulations are in place. Even with those laws and regulations, the government should not dictate terms. Instead, the involvement and participation of the private sector is necessary, because once those laws are passed, private businesses are the entities that deal with them—not the government. In terms of making the atmosphere in the industry conducive to doing business, the involvement of private actors is crucial. As long as investors lack confidence in the institutions themselves, they will not invest. That is why the business community in the tourism industry simply cannot be composed of government players. In fact, since I assumed my current position, this has been my main focus. For example, I hold regular meetings with members of the private sector. I meet with the Tourism Confederation of Tanzania quarterly, and I am working to make the tourism industry easier to participate in. I am facing a situation where people explain that even though they wanted to go through the processes of constructing a branded hotel, for whatever reason, it did not work. Instead, they often go to Rwanda and claim that permission was granted in two days, and in Kenya perhaps only three. These entrepreneurs are installing infrastructure and building hotels, which is something that could support generations to come. This is what myself and a number of others are seeking to improve upon. Tourists expect a certain level of quality when they arrive in Tanzania and the infrastructure needs to be there to make it possible.</p><h4>How will the tourism industry contribute to Tanzania's Development Vision 2025?</h4><p>I believe that if there is a particular sector that can contribute immensely to the Tanzanian goal of attaining the status of a middle-income country, it is definitely tourism. The sector has already been the leading foreign exchange generator in this country for years. Moreover, tourism also makes a substantial contribution to GDP, and has only recently been overtaken by mining. My belief is that if we can attract solid players—and I am confident that we can—Tanzania could absolutely overcome remaining obstacles and lead the way for the opening up of the country. Visiting tourists contribute to the economy, but the domino effect becomes apparent in the benefits that other small businesses get from that activity. In order to expand the sector, we must re-focus our efforts. Our tourism offering has focused heavily on wildlife, but we also have beautiful beaches. However, there is very little awareness of Tanzania's beaches. People know about the Caribbean islands and Mexico, and beach tourism generates fantastic tourism revenue there. In Kenya, Mombasa for example, has hotels and resorts associated with beach tourism. The reality of Tanzania today is that visiting tourists view it as a destination for a safari for one or two days before departing. Yes, tourism is an important sector and a huge contributor to Tanzania's Vision 2025 goal, but its sheer potential is what makes the industry truly attractive and interesting. There is enormous room for growth.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe your business model and plans for expansion?<br></h4><p>4G, namely fourth-generation technology, marks a huge leap forward, particularly in terms of data quality. Currently, we do not offer voice services, but will do in early 2014, and have already completed our first test calls. The real delay is the high cost of the handsets that are only just reaching the market. We started out just with routers, but now also have dongles, we have just launched Mi-Fi's, and our Wi-Fi hotspot service were launched in 3Q2013. Even in devices we have noticed a price decline over the past year, which had been one of the main barriers to entry. We are currently in Dar es Salaam and are expanding our coverage of the city in 3Q2013 and out to certain regions by 4Q2013. By the end of 2014, we should be covering all major cities and towns nationwide. Beyond that, we will need to think altogether bigger.</p><h4>What is the potential for 4G in this market?</h4><p>The internet has become increasingly important worldwide. And in a country with less developed infrastructure, it can take on more importance in some ways than in a developed market. If the transportation system is inadequate, say, it is easier to do business online. This is one issue. Additionally, the price of the devices themselves is declining, and I am sure that this will also be the case for smart phones, as lower-end and cheaper versions reach the market, many produced in China. We are seeing a greater uptake, and I think the fact that the quality of LTE is excellent makes it worthwhile. We are hearing feedback that customers are using it much more because the quality is that much better with LTE 4G technology. Because a smart phone is fast and application rich, you can do so much on it, and being able to connect via LTE really enhances the experience. With our routers, even if it's not an LTE phone, any Wi-Fi enabled device can be used, such as a BlackBerry, laptop, Kindle, or printer.</p><h4>Where else is Smile present?</h4><p>We launched our services in Uganda on June 6, 2013. We will launch officially in Nigeria in early 2014, but already have a live network and commercial customers in Ibadan. We have yet to commence business in the Democratic Republic of Congo, but will do so shortly.</p><h4>How do you confront the challenges of being the first in the market?</h4><p>For us, it is all about experience. I think that people who are not in telecommunications themselves don't care about 2G, 3G, or 4G; they simply care about what it does. The way to get people using it is through experience. Much of our advertising involves showcasing; the bulk of our budget does not go on above-the-line marketing, such as billboards. Instead, we organize many events to let people experience our products first hand. People visit our stores out of curiosity, and we also have around 20 free hotspots around the city where people can experience the service. This is the best way to convince them. And once people see how fast our network is, it's hard to go back to what they had before.</p><h4>Are there more investments planned for the future?</h4><p>Yes, absolutely. More sites were introduced September and October of 2013, with coverage of all major areas of Dar es Salaam. The next target is coverage on the outskirts of the city and at least one region beyond Dar es Salaam. In 2014, we should have coverage of all of major cities in Tanzania.</p><h4>The government has recently announced new telecommunications taxes. What problems do they present for you?</h4><p>We have had to increase our pricing to absorb the impact of the increased tax rate. This works out at about an 18% increase, once you add VAT. It really affects us because the definition of “telecoms" has been amended to include electronic communications instead of straightforward telecommunications. Operators already paid these taxes at 12.5% so it amounted to a 2% increase, but for the ISPs it was a 14.5% hike.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you see investors playing in the coming years in Tanzania's transport sector?<br></h4><p>I think the private sector has a lot of potential in the coming years. We have an expansive country, with a total area of 945,000 square kilometers and a growing population of 44 million people. If you look back just 52 years to our independence, the population barely numbered 10 million. We have six neighboring countries: Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Mozambique, Zambia, and Malawi, and boast a long coastline with many ports. Therefore, it goes without saying that transport is a crucial consideration, and that an improved system has great significance for the country and the entire region. Yet, the prohibitive cost of infrastructure requires private sector investment. Our central rail line running from Dar es Salaam to Kigoma, built in 1906, is obsolete and in need of renovation. Our long-term plan is to have a standard gauge railway from Dar es Salaam to Kigali and Musongati in Burundi. Yet our short-term scheme simply involves the replacement of existing rails. These have a tolerance of 56 pounds per yard, and we ideally need 80 pounds per yard to allow increased cargo transportation. This is an enormous task for a developing country, and requires major investment to be realized. I am happy that the private sector has shown strong cooperation in this regard. A number of companies, such as Bakhresa, which transports flour to Uganda and moves substantial freight, have also been in talks. We requested its financial contribution to renovate new locomotives in exchange for use of the line. We also have a road network of about 86,000 kilometers and the government has been building further roads; however, this has also been difficult. Unfortunately, over the years around 95% of cargo has moved by road rather than rail. To safeguard our roads, without neglecting their use either, we need to invest more in railway transportation. This said, we also want the private sector to take an interest in the road network, and indeed, a number of new roads are already being built on a PPP basis, such as the Chinese Expressway. There is much leeway for private sector participation, and more can be done to accommodate it to foster a welcoming environment for the foreign investor.</p><h4>How will higher efficiency be achieved enabling the Port of Dar es Salaam to handle increased cargo volume?</h4><p>We have a number of plans in place. For example, we are renovating berths numbers one through seven. These were built in the 1950s with no improvement made in the interim, resulting in inefficiencies. We are seeking financing for renovation and capacity expansion of the ports as soon as possible. We have taken very serious measures to combat problems such as inefficiency, theft, and congestion. We replaced the entire management board and subsequently advertized the positions internationally. Importantly, we exercise zero-tolerance for theft. In 2012, when I joined the Ministry, about 30 containers had unaccountably disappeared. Today, those responsible are accountable and responsible for any losses. In short, we have made notable progress on this front, and I am sure that the port will become one of the most efficient in Africa over the coming years. In fact, the 18 million ton target should be reached by 2015 or 2016.</p><h4>There is tight competition in Tanzania in the air travel sector. What regulatory decisions have allowed the competitive environment of lower airfares to come about?</h4><p>For a long time, Tanzania had only one airline, namely Air Tanzania. Later on Precision Air arrived, but the country needed greater competition, and I am still inviting players. By the end of 2013, there will be many new operators coming in, which create a better environment of choice for the people of East Africa.</p><div class="quote">“  We are upgrading Kigoma airport to become one of the largest in the country, and Tabora airport is also almost complete. "</div><h4>In terms of airports, how will the airport authority increase the reach of those airlines over the coming years?</h4><p>Our concentration should be on infrastructure and this is our responsibility. We should be able to provide the requisite environment for air travel. We have been very busy constructing airports. For instance, the Mwanza airport is being upgraded to an international facility. We are upgrading Kigoma airport to become one of the largest in the country, and Tabora airport is also almost complete. Even in Kilwa, we have undertaken renovation, while work is underway on a new terminal at Dar es Salaam. We have built a state-of-the-art airport in Panda, situated in the bush, and commenced work on a new airport in Songea. However, we are not in competition with the private sector, but rather encouraging its participation.</p><h4>President Kikwete is passionate about the Tanzania Deevelopment Vision 2025 and the idea of Tanzania becoming a middle-income country. How does transport factor into this?</h4><p>By 2025, we should have mechanized agriculture and be doing better in terms of education provision. In fact, we should generally be doing better across all sectors. The mainstay of the economy is agriculture, for which transport infrastructure is crucial. Farmers in the south of the country are being encouraged to grow more, but at the end of the day the reality is that there is no means of transporting the produce. This is a priority; we cannot achieve the Vision 2025 without radical solutions and tangible results. We have no other option but to improve, and I am confident that the coming two years will witness dramatic change.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the government's policies and the strategies of the Tanzania Airport Authority (TAA) helped with the current boom in Tanzanian airports?<br></h4><p>We operate according to the National Transport Policy of 2003, which is currently under revision. We also operate to a five-year plan. These are the factors contributing to the preparation of our strategic plans. Finally, we are guided by Vision 2025. Tanzania has 385 airfields and airports. The TAA manages 60 of them, and these account for 90% of total air traffic, with the exception of Zanzibar; when combined with Zanzibar, the figure rises to 99%. The National Transport Policy states that in each of the country's 30 regions, a regional airport should have the capacity to handle an aircraft of 70-100 passengers. Every city in this country requires an airport that can cater for aircraft capacity of 100-150 passengers. And as we border seven countries, each border region should have an airport that can handle 150-passenger planes. We also have international airports at Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar, and plan to upgrade Mwanza and Mbeya Songwe to that level. By 2018, we should have five international airports, including Dar es Salaam. And due to the discovery of energy and gas resources, there is also the likelihood of Mtwara being developed and expanded.</p><h4>Just how central is airport infrastructure for Tanzania's future?</h4><p>It is very simple. I have always believed that employers and investors fly, rather than drive. Therefore, if an investor from abroad visits Dar es Salaam and needs to fly to Mtwara the next day, there must be an airport to enable this. In short, decision makers fly. Our own executives also need to travel efficiently. Within the country, they may need to transport their goods from one point to another, which cannot efficiently be done by rail or road. Another important factor in developing the aviation industry is tourism. We cannot expect a tourist to fly from Europe, and then ride a bus for 12 hours just to visit an attraction. We have to build up our air infrastructure to facilitate their stay. Once you develop air transportation, you fully open up your country. As a good example of this development, Dar es Salaam airport is growing at a rate of 16% per year, while Mtwara is growing at 30%, and Mwanza at 40% in step with the mining industry.</p><h4>Could you describe the Terminal 3 project at Dar es Salaam Airport and it's financing?</h4><p>The project is being developed using the export credit agency model. Following the 2008 crisis, an opportunity arose to trigger growth again; we acted on this. How the scheme works is that you work with a country, which guarantees it, and then you borrow from one of the major banks, and complete the project. In our case, the Netherlands and the UK have guaranteed our loans. Of the related financing, 50% came from these two countries, via a mutually beneficial agreement.</p><div class="quote">“  Dar es Salaam airport is growing at a rate of 16% per year, while Mtwara is growing at 30%, and Mwanza at 40%. "</div><h4>What other projects does TAA have in the pipeline?</h4><p>In Mtwara, there is a project ready for private sector involvement, as indeed there are in Mwanza, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Songwe. We will have a better sense of what type of investment is most appropriate in light of a current study being conducted by Nathan Associates.</p><h4>What challenges exist for the TAA in Tanzania?</h4><p>Flying is still often seen as a rather elite mode of transportation, and its importance is still overlooked by some. There is currently a degree of political will to develop the industry in Tanzania, but when you compare it to other forms of transportation, such as rail and shipping, it is not considered to be of equal importance. Statistically speaking though, $1 invested in air transportation brings a return of $12. This is definitely not the case with rail. In Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and Dubai, we clearly note how airports have transformed their cities. Another obstacle to overcome is the cultural reaction against private sector control over utilities, although I think that this mindset can be changed. I am a big believer in private sector participation, which is why I had opted for a build-operate-transfer (BOT) contract for Terminal 3, although I faced considerable hostility toward this idea. We need only look to Hong Kong or Dubai to realize that private sector ownership is not the issue, so long as the airport concerned is a good one. Unfortunately, I did not win the support I needed from my colleagues, which is why we changed to an enterprise collaboration architecture (ECA) model.</p><h4>In terms of investors, airports, airfields, and aircraft, where do you see the country in five years time?</h4><p>Within five years, all regional airports will have sufficient lighting systems to allow for flights 24 hours a day. Our international airports will also be able to cater to any of the world's largest aircraft. Currently, we are only connected to Europe by one daily flight of KLM. We should have at least five airlines connecting us with Europe, and Turkish Airlines will hopefully soon be one of them. For the Middle East, we are well covered in terms of Dubai and Qatar. I expect to see intercontinental flights from Dar es Salaam to Europe and North America before too long. In terms of passenger numbers, I foresee a doubling from the current 4 million to 8 million passengers annually. I would predict no less that 12 million within the next decade.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania has a housing deficit of around 3 million units, and that is growing by nearly 200,000 units per year. What steps is the National Housing Corporation (NHC) taking to address this?<br></h4><p>It is important to appreciate why we have such a deficit today. In 1975, the government stopped subsidizing and supporting the NHC. Inflation was also high, which affected interest rates, and therefore it was expensive for both the NHC and the clients trying to take on obligations. There were also laws in place that favoured tenants over landlords, as well as a law that protected borrowers at the expense of lenders. For nearly three and a half decades, there wasn't much progress in the housing sector from the governmental perspective, which meant that the housing developer was left to intervene. In 2010, the government decided to take a bold step, having realized the challenges it was facing in the housing industry. One step the government took, apart from reforming our laws, was to restructure the NHC. I arrived at the institute in 2010 as part of the restructuring to get the NHC back on track as a more efficient institution, operating as efficiently as possible in the private sector. Over a period of three years, the NHC has been left to operate, work, and deliver with very minimal political intervention. We have a reasonably good balance sheet to operate from and deliver on our agenda. We are an institution with a capital base of nearly $1.4 billion, which makes NHC the largest company in East Africa by capital base. In terms of real estate, we are still among the top three largest companies in Sub-Saharan Africa. The NHC has a number of ongoing projects. Firstly, we think our role should not solely be to develop houses; there are other areas where we can help. For instance, we use our position as a government institution to influence policymakers and bring about the right policies, which will encourage lenders, developers, and all players within the sector to work together and deliver more housing. We will do that through a forthcoming R&amp;D association that will help to bring about a common base from which to influence, lobby, and bring about the right policies, the right changes, and the right practices within the industry. The final thing that we have been doing is engaging the financial institutions. So far, we have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with 12 financial institutions and 12 banks that are willing to lend to our clients. We guarantee that when we build houses, our buyers will be financed at affordable rates.</p><h4>What has changed within the NHC since the 2010 restructuring?</h4><p>It was done purely on the government's initiative; we managed the process internally without the help of the IMF or the World Bank. The first step of the restructuring was to scrutinize our environment and vision, whereby we evaluated our entire strategy and to develop a better plan. Secondly, the strategic plan needed the right organizational structure. When we were comfortable that we had devised one, we addressed the most difficult and challenging part of the job, namely finding the right people for the right positions. The institution had been stable for 50 years, having put down strong roots, rendering it rather resistant to change. In a bold move, we replaced 100% of the management team, in pursuit of the right people with the right skills, talent, and motivation to deliver on our agenda. We gave this opportunity to existing candidates and additional people from outside the company; we especially encouraged junior employees to apply. Most importantly for the directors, we ensured that everyone working for them was contracted.</p><h4>What do the four new MoUs with major banks achieve for the NHC, and what wider effect will they have on the real estate market?</h4><p>These agreements are critical for us since financing allows people to buy houses. The dream of most people the world over is to own their own home. Because we had been signing with the banks, one of our key criteria was access to long-term loans of a minimum of 15—20 years. Formerly, they had been lending for between eight and 12 years. Tanzania has also recently seen legal reform, which was well received, and not least by the banking community. In the past, banks here actively pursued mortgage lending and were often dragging their feet. In order to entice them we provided an option; those lending to an NHC client were guaranted a buyback option. Accordingly, in the event of a client defaulting within five years we pledged to repurchase that property. We have also gone one step further by working with an insurance firm acting as a guarantor for the bank, and insuring it for the 20% down payment. Therefore, a client is not required to pay that 20% to the bank, but rather, a small amount of money as a premium. For example, if I sell a house for $100,000, the 20% is $20,000. Now, the client has two options. He can find the $20,000 and deposit it at the bank, or else he can go to the insurance firm, which will then pay the premium. The premium amount will come to maybe $500 or $1,000, which is much more affordable for the client than $20,000. In this manner the bank has been guaranteed, and everything is within the maximum value of the house.</p><div class="quote">“  We guarantee that when we build houses, our buyers will be financed at affordable rates.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>In 1999 and 2000, petroleum surveys led to most of the contracts going to currently active private companies. How important is exploration for the future of the country?<br></h4><p>Our responsibilities center on exploration activities to determine whether we can discover sufficient oil reserves. Over the past three years, we have discovered significant volumes of gas, amounting to around 41.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of reserves. We would like more companies to undertake exploration, so that we can discover further gas reserves, and potentially oil as well.</p><h4>How can the country develop its natural gas resources, while spreading the benefits of that development equitably and having a net positive effect on the population?</h4><p>The government's key objective is to ensure that reserves are primarily directed to domestic consumption, although we are also looking into exporting LNG. We believe that local energy supply shortfalls will cease once we start exploiting new gas reserves, as the bulk of them will be directed internally. The local production of fertilizers, methanol, and plastics is expected to develop as a result.</p><h4>Minister Muhongo and the Commissioner for Minerals both touched on the government holding a stake in hydrocarbon projects. What kind of stake would TPDC take?</h4><p>It is difficult to speculate on what percentage we will retain. The resources belong to Tanzania, meaning it must retain a substantial stake in them. When it comes to production set to arise from natural gas, we would like to participate in this too, but that will depend more on how much we manage to finance it, as you cannot insist on, say, a 90% stake unless you can finance such capital-intensive projects.</p><h4>How has the recent gas bill changed the way you do business, and how might constitutional reform affect your business?</h4><p>Currently, the government is working on natural gas policy, an instrument that will help the private sector by clearly defining the government position. It will also stipulate the framework within which companies will have to work. Constitutional reform is at the draft stage, so it's too early to comment realistically.</p><h4>The Mnazi Bay Gas Field was quite a discovery for Tanzania. How is work progressing on that front, and could you give us an expected timeline for project development?</h4><p>Production at the Mnazi Bay Gas Field commenced in 2006, but as a very small-scale operation. Today, we are generating about 12 MW of power, although the infrastructure could be expanded to 350 MW. We are laying a pipeline from Mnazi Bay, which will bring gas to Dar es Salaam, where our turbines currently use liquid fuel, but could easily be converted to gas. Given that Tanzania is currently losing about $1 billion a year through fuel imports, this is a critical project for the national economy. Initially, the gas from Songo Songo and Mnazi Bay will power the turbines in Dar es Salaam.</p><h4>How will the TPDC help to achieve the Vision 2025 goals?</h4><p>In order to achieve these goals, the essential element is power, most quickly produced via natural gas. This is why the government is prioritizing the pipeline project, to reach the required capacity by adding more turbines. Secondly, the advent of gas will facilitate the development of a range of industries that will further contribute to the economy. One of the resulting products, fertilizer, is crucial for agriculture, and they will be produced as the chemicals industry evolves. This confirms the many positive developments set to come from gas. At the end of 2013, we will be holding a tender offering potential investors the opportunity to bid for the exploration rights at seven deep-sea blocks and one in Lake Tanganyika. The process was launched on October 25, 2013, and end on May 15, 2014.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you plan to ensure consistent and plentiful electricity in the coming years?<br></h4><p>For the past three years, we have been facing frequent power shortages. The key reason is that investment in our country's energy system was based on hydropower generation. Over time, we have seen the importance of diversification, and now employ various types of generation. The kind of power mix that we are considering for the future involves natural gas, hydropower, coal, and renewables. To start with, we have decided that with the completion of the gas pipeline from the south to Dar es Salaam, we should generate sufficient power to address the issue of power shortages while awaiting further energy sources. We are placing great emphasis on the gas pipeline because it will bring gas capable of generating up to 3,900 MW. Our current shortage is being addressed through liquid oil, which provides around 350 MW. Production of 300 MW and 500 MW would address most of our current shortfall. However, we intend to generate enough power such that even if hydropower contributes nothing, we would still have sufficient power from natural gas.</p><h4>How will the restructuring of TANESCO into three distinct arms help it emerge from debt, fund new projects, and meet the energy requirements of Tanzania's economy?</h4><p>We are considering establishing three separate companies for generation, transmission, and distribution. The generation company will also make room for other sector players to participate. A more open generation sector will enable the participation of independent power producers (IPPs) in power generation. In turn, greater private sector participation will relieve the government somewhat when it comes to related generation-related investment. We believe that the transmission segment should remain exclusively in government hands. Meanwhile, in terms of distribution, there will initially be one company, with a view to opening up the sector at a later date.</p><h4>How will new technologies allow you to produce more electricity and meet your goal of doubling capacity?</h4><p>We are mostly looking at green and renewable technologies. Around 80% of Tanzanians live in rural areas and extending the national grid to all such areas presents notable difficulties. In those areas we believe the national grid might not cover within the next 10 years, we are turning to solar power. We are also considering the construction of further hydro plants to exploit available water resources in various parts of the country. If a small hydro plant that provides electricity for 3,000 people is viable, more such facilities can be built at different locations. This will reduce the pressure on TANESCO to extend the national grid. We are also considering mini-grids dedicated to an area not necessarily connected to the main grid, and that are fed by different sources.</p><h4>How does TANESCO plan to ensure that the economy has adequate electricity capacity to grow at a rate of over 7% per year?</h4><p>Once we had confirmed the presence of sufficient natural gas resources, we formulated the Natural Gas Utilization Policy. It stipulates a greater use of natural gas in power generation but, as we progress, we shall slowly generate more power from other sources—especially coal. We are also confident that natural gas has greater potential than simply being a fuel for power generation. It will not be economical to burn natural gas for power generation given the presence of other sources like coal, abundant in Mozambique. We plan to set out with a program of natural gas-fuelled power generation to last around a decade, and, thereafter, gradually increase the use of coal. We are also talking more about clean coal and a greater use of renewables. Tanzania has considerable renewable potential; a large stretch of the Rift Valley has geothermal and wind potential. The Rift Valley acts as a wind tunnel and is, thus, ideal for the many wind projects located there. We are also exploring possible geothermal projects along the valley. Solar energy is also a plentiful resource to be tapped in Tanzania. So, with many opportunities for power generation, we will start by generating more from natural gas, and then slowly diversify into coal, renewables, and hydro-electricity. We have an unexplored, untapped hydro potential of more than 5,000 MW, although hydro is a capital and time intensive option. Hence, such projects are long-term in nature.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>The industrial sector in Tanzania accounts for around 22% of GDP. The Sustainable Industrial Development Policy predicts that by 2025 the figure will have reached 40%. What policies will ensure that this is the case?</h4><p>First of all, I think the key area to focus on is infrastructural development, especially in energy. We have to develop our energy capacity to ensure the healthy development of several industries. The government has implemented a number of initiatives to ensure that we solve problems related to energy, and in fact the sector is one where we have registered marked strength. There have been discoveries of gas and the government is now in the process of harnessing this potential. A pipeline is under construction that will link the gas fields with the northern part of the country, where our industries are located. Recently, the government has also signed an agreement with General Electric and Symbion for the development of a 600 MW gas-fired plant. We are also working in the southern part of the country on developing coal for energy at the Ngaka Mines, which could add about 200-300 MW to the national grid. We also have a major wind power generation project in the central region of the country, in Singida, with the potential to generate between 100 to 300 MW. The intention is to be generating around 3,000 MW or more by 2015. I am hopeful that our industrial sector will grow faster than today once we have completed these projects. We have prepared an Integrated Industrial Development Strategy, which considers three main areas. The first is the development of basic industries, where we have placed a greater emphasis on iron, steel, and coal. We are also working hard on developing soda ash from the northern part of the country in Engaruka. We consider these to be key areas for the development of basic industries. We are also looking to boost the development of the petrochemicals, textiles, cement, fertilizer, and hide and skin subsectors, among others. Then comes our focus on the development of SMEs, which account for a huge portion of our manufacturing sector to the tune of 50%-60%. Some of the most important challenges in developing SMEs are technological requirements, capacity building, and, crucially, entrepreneurship and skill shortage. Quality of production is the only way we can contemplate entering foreign markets with local products. Again, we are looking at the possibilities of utilizing the surrounding market in different communities because when you produce, you need to sell.</p><h4>What growth rate do you think can realistically be achieved within the next decade?</h4><p>The industrial sector is now contributing close to 9% of total GDP. We are targeting 15%-20% once we have solved the energy challenges.</p><h4>In March 2013, Tanzania signed a number of trade agreements with China, and the nation also has trade agreements in the region, including SADC, COMESA, and the East African Community. What lies ahead for Tanzania in terms of trade agreements?</h4><p>The signing of trade agreements means opening up trade opportunities, and is vital to strengthening trade facilitation, which also raises the question of trade barriers. We need to reduce trade barriers for the rapid development of trade between countries. At the same time, we need to rationalize our customs procedures and tax regimes, and streamline the way we move goods between countries. I think these are the areas that we have to work on today. Otherwise, the impact of the several trade agreements in place today will be minimal. Then again, when we talk of trade facilitation with other countries, we want a setup that will allow our companies to export and not solely facilitate imports, but pursue workable and balanced trade. Again, given the current nature of the economy, we cannot expect to develop our industrial capacity without investment, both local and foreign.</p><div class="quote">“  The industrial sector is now contributing close to 9% of total GDP. We are targeting 15%-20%. "</div><h4>Nearly 80% of Tanzania's population earns its living from the agricultural sector, which is not highly industrialized. What steps are being taken to modernize it?</h4><p>Our agriculture sector mostly depends on rainfall. In that regard, we have to invest much more in irrigation. The infrastructural requirements for massive irrigation projects are daunting, especially in terms of resources. What we really need to do is to put more of an emphasis on agriculture and look at the areas on which we can concentrate. You also cannot simply develop agriculture by technological infusion, but must also develop agricultural infrastructure. Since most of agriculture is realized in rural areas, we need to look at rural infrastructure itself. If we can develop electricity and introduce semi-processing entities, I believe the sector will begin to contribute immensely to national GDP. This is one of the biggest challenges ahead, and if, say, we produce coffee, we have to also sell processed coffee. If we produce maize, we have to sell maize flour. These are some of the challenges that we have to deal with.</p><h4>What are some of the major achievements of the government's privatization program?</h4><p>What we are trying to do though privatization is import or develop skills, technology, and capital into the industrial sector. This can only be achieved by the private sector because the private sector, generally, is the best allocator of resources. We believe that the government should maintain the role of keeping the rule of law and order. Industrialization should be run by the private sector. That is why we have undertaken a number of reforms, including privatization.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your agency's responsibilities in Tanzania?<br></h4><p>The Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority (TCAA) is an industry watchdog providing regulation and economic oversight for national civil aviation. At the same time, we are a service provider offering navigational services domestically, and also in Rwanda and Burundi, above 24,500 feet. This responsibility was given to us as both are very small countries, and it had proven to be inefficient for their pilots to constantly switch radio frequencies for navigational guidance. We, therefore, assumed the responsibility of providing a consistent service.</p><h4>When we spoke with the Minister of Transport, he was extremely excited about Tanzania's newly robust and competitive airline industry. How has the TCAA used regulations to create that industry?</h4><p>We have basically opened up to opportunity. Previously, we had just one airline—the government-owned Air Tanzania. However, we then decided that others interested in providing these services could do so, and in essence foreign investors are welcome in the sector. In fact, 100% foreign ownership is possible, as is any percentage that you agree on with a local partner, as long as your principal place of business is Tanzania, and you conform to all regulations. Basically, we found that a number of local investors lacked the financial capacity to conduct business alone, which was one of the main reasons why we opened up to foreign participation.</p><h4>The TCAA provides navigational services for Rwanda and Burundi. What other ties is the company fostering to promote regional integration?</h4><p>Within the common market and the framework of East African unity, we are now looking to liberalize the transport services that operate between us. Then, there is a project known as the Yamoussoukro Decision, signed by African transport ministers and heads of state to bring about freedom of movement among participating countries.</p><h4>What growth trends do you expect over the coming years?</h4><p>Even during the global financial crisis, our growth never fell below 8%, which I expect to continue. If the economy is going to grow—and with everything that is happening that is all but certain—then there will be a growth in industry. The growth of industry is linked to GDP growth, and growth in the aviation industry is nearly always double that of GDP.</p><h4>What are some of your successes in this market?</h4><p>The number of aircraft and operators is constantly on the rise in Tanzania, but so too is the variety of aircraft that we cater for. In addition, we have just been successfully audited. When a company becomes blacklisted, it faces a number of serious problems. That is why our highly regulated industry makes for an extremely safe mode of transportation. The regulators check everything, right down to the facilities where our aircraft are serviced. We demonstrate that every aspect of our operations functions correctly. We have also held ISO certification since 2010. Finally, I would like to mention our successful aviation training school that serves students from South Africa, Namibia, Uganda, and even West Africa. This is not only a profit-making entity, but can also diversify its activities to encompass pilot training and engineering.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What powers did the Coffee Act of 2001 grant to the board?</h4><p>The Coffee Board is a government institution that was established by Parliamentary Act No. 23 of 2001. Its basic priority was to ensure sector regulation in terms of coffee cultivation, processing, and trade. Monitoring of these three aspects makes sure of a defined means of crop production, which is governed by the rules of production. It takes care of quality issues and aims to secure volumes in terms of production. The second issue is to ensure that processing is also focused on market needs, which requires standardized processing. The third issue concerns marketing and trade, largely because more than 90% of the crop is exported. We have to know the destination; who is exporting it, and where it will go. This is so we can analyze consumer trends and behavior, while knowing how much we generate from the market.</p><h4>How will Tanzania achieve its goal of increasing its coffee output to 80,000 tons by 2016, and what role do investors play in that growth?</h4><p>In 2010, we created what we call a Coffee Sector Strategy, which lays out plans for the next 10 years. The strategy will end in 2021. It was made in collaboration with stakeholders in the sector, and we have set certain goals and milestones. In the first five years, which ends in 2016, we targeted to increase our production from 50,000 tons to 80,000 tons. Then, by 2021, we hope production will exceed 100,000 tons. We want to improve the quality of the coffee and the business environment, as well as expand the market. In terms of the volume increase, it will be achieved by ensuring that crops are improved through research. We have a national coffee research center here called the Tanzania Coffee Research Institute (TaCRI). TaCRI was set up in 2001 and by 2005 had already started to release some good varieties of coffee. The plants were crossbred to upgrade their strains. Productivity has to date almost doubled from the average of 300 grams to almost 600-700 grams. On the ground, it has been confirmed that our average production would rise from 350 kilograms to 1,000-1,500 kilograms per hectare, which is the target. Today, we have an estimated 200,000 hectares under coffee cultivation; we plan to increase this by 10,000 to 210,000 hectares within this timeframe. We have already involved all the growing regions and relevant government institutions in this strategy. Land expansion is the second part of the strategy to increase production. The third aspect takes into account the current business environment, whereby production is 90% realized by smallholder growers. Our third drive seeks to entice investors to coffee cultivation, and not only in the trading of produced coffee. In collaboration with government institutions and authorities, we have identified areas where investors can access land for coffee cultivation. For example, in 2011, one company was given 2,000 hectares in southern Tanzania, where there is reserve land. It has already started to plant coffee and is poised to commence production. Small owners will always seek government support to continue their business, whereas investors will go out on their own; you only encounter them when conducting trade. More private sector investment is the way ahead.</p><h4>What does Tanzania bring to the table in terms of unique coffee varieties?</h4><p>Tanzania is one of the top three quality coffee producers. Coffee quality is defined in two categories: one, the origin and the conditions of growing in that area, and two, the processing and handling. If you go to the source, Tanzania is among the three countries (the other two are Colombia and Kenya) that produce the best Arabica coffee. We have the opportunity to have the best Arabica and Colombian milds, which is usually used for blending with other Arabicas to improve their flavor. The Arabica coffee bean needs to have the pulp removed to prepare it for roasting. You can also sundry it to prepare for roasting. Preparations under wet processing (pulping) produces mild or washed Arabica coffee. The sun-dried coffee is called hard, or unwashed coffee. The washed is the best type because it is mild and attractive. It requires the right infrastructure on the ground during harvesting, however, so farmers can execute the washing process at wet mills. The equipment is used for removing the skin, fermenting, cleaning, and then drying the beans. We lacked this infrastructure for many years. When a farmer is preparing this alone, they pulp by hand. They need to have the correct cleaning water and drying facilities, which is a challenge for small farms. What we have done since 2001, under the new law, is decide that Tanzanian coffee should be fully washed to remain competitive with Colombia and Kenya. Investment in these wet mills and washing stations has been ongoing since then, and we are about halfway through the necessary requirements with about 450 mills throughout the country already installed.</p><div class="quote">“  Today, we have an estimated 200,000 hectares under coffee cultivation. "</div><h4>What lies in the future for Tanzanian coffee?</h4><p>Since 2012, we have been working with an organization in Geneva to establish a Tanzania intellectual property system for coffee so we can brand and protect it. We hope it will help to bring home the intrinsic value of this product. We have been challenged a few times when people travel around the world and see Kenyan or Colombian coffee, but not Tanzanian coffee. That is because we have not protected it. Most of the traders use our quality coffee to blend it with regular- or low-quality coffee so that it can be sold. To be protected, we have to change the way we promote our name in the market.</p><h4>What could you say about public-private partnerships (PPP) in this sector?</h4><p>The drive that started in 2010 has been very strong. Part of what is happening, which previously was not there, was the implementation of a PPP system. We have all the stakeholders, and coffee has a long value chain. We have different players at each of these levels, and sometimes it is a challenge to bring all of them together in a common place. We have managed to catch up and we meet as a national coffee forum to discuss the way forward. As a result of that, as of June 2013 (because the crop starts in September), we had already produced over 70,000 tons for the first time in 50 years, the average having been 50,000 tons, and also our highest year. We want to maintain this level and reach 100,000 tons by 2021. That is why we see our 2016 goal of 80,000 tons as achievable; we need less than 10,000 tons more from now on. This increase has resulted from working with the stakeholders to ensure increased volumes.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What are you doing to increase the use of technology in Tanzania?<br></h4><p>As a government, to improve technology you need certain fundamental elements in place before you can pursue any new strategies. The most important of these is infrastructure, into which we have invested $200 million to build the ICT backbone. So far, we have built 7,560 kilometers of national ICT infrastructure, which has been connected by three submarine cables. Our neighboring countries, Rwanda, Malawi, and Zambia, are also using the national ICT backbone. So far, seven companies in Tanzania are using the network, namely AirTel, Zantel, Tigo Tanzania, Vodacom, TTCL, Infinity Africa, and Simbanet. What's more, companies from overseas are taking advantage of the ICT backbone, such as MTL Rwanda, U-COM of Burundi, MTL Malawi, and MTL and Airtel of Zambia. In terms of infrastructure, we also signed a new contract with a Chinese company in May 2013 to build a data center. You can have the infrastructure, but without a data center you cannot appreciate the meaning of the national ICT backbone—it represents a backup of all the information you have on your national network. The contract is for $100 million and the center will be built in Dar es Salaam. If the ICT backbone is a highway, then we also need feeder roads, and this is what we are working on, especially in rural areas. The backbone must be connected to people to fully have significance. At the same time, there is a joint venture between the government and the private sector in a PPP framework to build a metro fiber-optic network in Dar es Salaam with the involvement of Airtel, Tigo, and Zantel. We are building 90 kilometers in the city, and also do so in Dodoma, Arusha, and Mwanza. The other key component or course is policy, and, in 2003, the ICT and Communications Policy was finalized. We also have the Science and Technology Policy dating from 1986, which is in the process of amendment. We are reviewing all ICT policy, because since 2003 the sector has seen many developments. We are now trying to make sure the new policy is appropriate for the unique challenges we currently face in a rapidly growing sector. In 2000, we had 150,000 subscribers, while today they number around 26.7 million. So, you can say that we have come a long way, but equally that a lot more needs to be done, especially with regard to security issues, which are a major concern for us. We are now preparing a cyber-security act, data-protection act, and an e-commerce act, and these three components will comprise the policy.</p><h4>How do you perceive Tanzania's progress in terms of technological implementation compared to other countries in the region?</h4><p>First of all, I think that in addition to the factors I have mentioned, it is also necessary to make sure that people know how to apply technology. We want the people of Tanzania to view ICT as a tool and a force for social development. We also have a special program for innovators. In Dar es Salaam, we have an ICT incubator called Teknohama Business Incubator, where talented people work on projects to make the most of ICT precisely as a tool for development. When we compare ourselves with other countries, we want to be able to see Tanzania as a hub for ICT. We have a unique location compared to surrounding countries. Rwanda and Burundi lack ports and, hence, locations for submarine cables. The first thing we did in phase one was to connect with the surrounding countries, which has been very successful. Take Kenya, for example; in terms of ICT infrastructure, it perhaps has 2,700 kilometers of fiber optics, but these are just laid between the main cities. In Tanzania, we have put installed cable in every region, as part of government policy. Uganda has only one line connecting Nairobi to Kampala and Entebbe. This is around 2,500 kilometers in length, but it is not functioning well. In Rwanda, it is working well, but that is a tiny country. I think we have done a good job in comparison, which is why we expect to ultimately become a hub for the region.</p><h4>What role will scientific education play in Tanzania's future growth?</h4><p>In our government's Vision 2025, one of the pillars is science and technology. Without investing in this, you cannot move forward or innovate, and this is underpinned by good education. From 2010, we decided to invest heavily in science and technology, and in that year alone invested TZS30 billion. During that time, we completed the Nelson Mandela Institute of Science and Technology, which is dedicated to post-graduate study. We spent around TZS51 billion on the institution, which is located in Arusha. We did this because we knew that if you do not prepare your young scientists, you will not go anywhere. In 2012 alone, the government sponsored 295 students on Master's and PhD programs. Innovation relies on the fruit of R&amp;D, which is why we invested heavily in the infrastructure of our research institutes, such as the agriculture institute in Dodoma. We have others in Zanzibar, Arusha, and elsewhere. And, as the government, we ensure the smooth progress of strategic, security, infrastructure, and human resource development.</p><div class="quote">“  Innovation relies on the fruit of R&amp;D, which is why we invested heavily in the infrastructure of our research institutes, such as the agriculture institute in Dodoma.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the current state and direction of US-Turkish energy cooperation?</h4><p>The US and Turkey have an excellent economic relationship, particularly in the energy sector. US companies are leaders in developing energy efficiency technologies and have an opportunity to support Turkey's efforts in this area. Some other potential areas for collaboration include shale gas development, clean coal, smart grids, energy storage, and hydrokinetic energy generation. For example, in July 2013, Turkish officials visited Texas to meet with regulators and to visit US shale gas fields. Turkey has expressed interest in learning from international experience related to environmental protection issues, investment models, and regulatory frameworks for unconventional oil and gas development. The Texas visit allowed us to share our experiences as Turkey begins to explore the development and utilization of its own unconventional oil and gas resources.</p><h4>The US has been a vocal supporter of the Southern Gas Corridor. What is the importance of Turkey to the project, and the US' regional energy strategy?</h4><p>Turkey is recognized as an important transit country for energy resources. The Southern Gas Corridor will bring additional supplies and price competition and bolster both Turkey's and Europe's goal of a liberalized, competitive market for natural gas with greater choice and lower prices for consumers. The December 17 signing of the final investment decision for stage two of the Shah Deniz natural gas production project was a tremendous milestone in realizing the Southern Corridor project. I want to underscore the strategic importance the US places on the realization of the Southern Gas Corridor. We believe this is a critical project to improve the energy security of Europe, Turkey, and Azerbaijan.</p><div class="quote">“US companies are leaders in developing energy efficiency technologies and have an opportunity to support Turkey's efforts."</div><h4>How is the US working with Turkey in the renewable energy and clean coal sector to increase its energy efficiency and long-term sustainability?</h4><p>We are building partnerships between academic institutions and our national laboratories in the US and Turkey to conduct joint research in the area of cleaner coal to ensure that coal is produced and burned efficiently with the least possible environmental impact. The US also recognizes that coal-fired power is increasing in Turkey, driven by its fast-growing energy demand and domestic coal reserves. This fact opens up numerous possibilities for the sharing of information between our two countries to ensure the minimization of the environmental impact of coal-produced power and to investigate new clean coal technologies, including carbon capture and sequestration. This year we began a research exchange program with the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK), the leading agency for management, funding, and research in Turkey, to work on developing cleaner ways to utilize coal for energy. Turkey is also fortunate to have solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and other resources. The Turkish government is committed to generating 30% of its energy from renewable resources by 2023. This is part of Turkey's efforts to enhance its energy security by diversifying its sources of supply through the development of domestic and renewable resources.</p><h4>During your keynote speech at the Atlantic Council Summit in Istanbul, you noted that governments have thus far struggled during the deployment phase of the technological innovation chain in the energy sector. How can governments like Turkey overcome these obstacles?</h4><p>Turkey is addressing climate change through a comprehensive strategic plan. Turkey's goals to generate 30% of its power from renewable sources and 10% of its power from nuclear energy by 2023 are both reasonable and attainable. Turkey is also making a concerted effort to increase energy efficiency. By introducing incentives for industry to adopt energy efficiency measures and creating certification requirements for energy service companies and energy managers, Turkey is encouraging businesses to look critically at their energy usage. The Near-Zero Zone project, which the US Department of Energy developed in cooperation with Turkey's Ministry of Energy, helps address the challenge of efficiency. The project was designed to reduce Turkey's dependence on energy imports, bolster energy security, cut carbon emissions, and make industry more profitable, while creating business opportunities for US and Turkish energy efficiency technology and service providers. The project, which provided 20 companies in Izmir with energy assessments, was designed to help companies in Turkey's Organized Industrial Zones recognize the benefits of cost-effective energy efficiency investments. The project demonstrated the potential to reduce energy consumption by approximately 20% with a return on investment as short as 18 months. The project has the potential to accelerate the growth of an energy efficiency market in Turkey and promote industrial energy efficiency across the country. The US and Turkey's work on renewables and efficiency not only demonstrate leadership on climate change, but also help to enhance energy security by reducing demand and diversifying supply and will promote economic prosperity and job creation. And, of course, reducing greenhouse gases creates a cleaner environment and protects natural resources for not only the two countries, but for the global community.</p><h4>What is Washington's view on the Turkish-Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) oil and gas deal that could send Iraqi oil to world markets via Turkey?</h4><p>The US wants to see Iraqi oil from all parts of that country—north to south—reaching global markets in a manner that reinforces regional energy security and allows markets to function optimally to support economic growth. However, oil and gas must be exported and marketed in a way that fulfills all parties' international obligations, and which reflects a constitutionally acceptable agreement between the government of Iraq and the KRG. Our position on energy trade from Iraq has been consistent and remains unchanged. The US does not support oil exports from any part of Iraq without the appropriate approval of the government of Iraq. The US supports a constitutional solution to resolve disputes over the management of Iraq's hydrocarbon resources. Maintaining a united and federal Iraq is a top priority of the US, and we are encouraged by the renewed dialogue between the KRG and the government of Iraq to work out their differences on energy policy. The US does not take sides in Iraq's internal disputes, but encourages both sides to come together in a way that allows all Iraqis to benefit from the country's rich natural resources. We are encouraged by signs of enhanced dialogue between the Turkish and Iraqi authorities in recent months. We are hopeful that the two countries will continue to strengthen their cooperation on energy policy.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Tufenkjian Frí¨res evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Our company is over 100 years old. It was started by my father, and it is run today by myself and my two brothers. We have expanded the company from being a small jewelry shop to an international name. Since 1909, Tufenkjian has been designing jewelry for a discerning clientí¨le who seek treasures that are stunning and timeless. Traveling from all over the globe, jewelry lovers enter our luxurious showroom knowing they will find precious gems, captivating designs, and the superior quality they desire. Today, we are proud to carry on our father's legacy as Lebanon's most prestigious fine jeweler, recognized for our expertise and for our ability to consistently create jewelry that dreams are made of. We have earned an unrivaled reputation for jewelry excellence in the region.</p><h4>Where do most of your customers come from?</h4><p>Many Arab countries are experiencing instability at the moment, and Europe is in a bad economic situation as well. Traditionally, our customers are from the Gulf, Europe, and the US. In addition, we also have some buyers from Africa.</p><div class="quote">“We have expanded the company from being a small jewelry shop to an international name."</div><h4>How has Tufenkjian been performing in Lebanon?</h4><p>In recent years, we have experienced our best era, and the banking sector was able to support the jewelry businesses very well. Our fashion and tastes lie between the Arab world and Europe, and takes the best parts of both. This makes it more creative than other countries in terms of design.</p><h4>What would you say makes the Lebanese customer unique?</h4><p>First, there are those that live in Lebanon on a relatively low salary. They tend to choose fashionable, smaller products. The Lebanese people who work abroad are generous and come back to Lebanon for their vacations. While they are here, they buy products like anyone from the Gulf region.</p><h4>What is the focus of your growth strategy?</h4><p>Currently, ours is a defensive strategy. We are waiting and watching to see what happens, and then we will decide on an active strategy. The sector is not performing as it has in previous years. This year has been very bad. With the travel alert, our sales to foreigners have dropped dramatically. In order to keep the company surviving, we are traveling to other countries and selling in our customers' own territories.</p><h4>How is Tufenkjian perceived in the region?</h4><p>We only have a store under our name in Jordan. In other countries, we sell to the big name shops, which distribute our products. We focus on what we are good at, and this has allowed us to survive. Our clients must be able to trust us and rely on us.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in 10 years, and what is your outlook on the future of the sector in general?</h4><p>When you are in a defensive mode, it is difficult to answer that question. If you ask me in six months then I can give you a better reply, but right now we are on standby. Lebanon is a free country and you can run your business openly, with no need for clandestine transactions. In situations where there are no restrictions on your business, you have the opportunity to grow. However, in my opinion, the market is currently oversaturated.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Gulf Business Machines (GBM) get its start in the Omani IT sector?</h4><p>GBM came into existence around 24 years ago as IBM's sole distributer in the GCC region, except for Saudi Arabia. In the early days, clients had IT tightly confined, with point solutions for accounting, inventory, and sales, and the IT department solely responsible for anything technology related. Today, it is very different. The consumerization of IT has meant that everyone in a company is both familiar with and dependent upon technology; clients demand solutions not products. We all have the experience of being able to simply download an app and use it immediately. In the business world things are slightly different; it is not possible for one vendor to have a solution and, more importantly, expertise in everything. Therefore, our clients are looking for a partner who can team up with multiple providers, design and integrate a complete solution to solve a business problem, and, importantly, stand by that solution once it is implemented. We depend upon IBM hardware because we believe it offers the best value for money in terms of performance and reliability. Reliability is extremely important, and we pride ourselves on having the best hardware service and maintenance business in the region. From a networking, security, and communications perspective, we have partnerships with Cisco, Juniper, F5, and other specialty vendors. We have seen the criticality of network-related solutions, particularly those involving security-related activities, increase in Oman, resulting in significant growth in our networking business. Recently, we focused heavily on our internal processes to improve quality and add value at each step. I am personally very focused on trying to add value with every interaction. If you are merely reselling someone else's solution without adding some quantifiable value to it you become unnecessary, and clients could simply order from the web. We are starting to see a slight shift in the market. Previously, price was the only determinant in choosing a system integrator; now, clients are appreciating that service quality, and the ability to deliver to business service level agreements, are just as important, if not more important, than price alone.</p><h4>What role do IT service providers play in the development of Oman's emerging IT sector?</h4><p>Today, it is easy to obtain technology; you simply do some research on the web and, with a few clicks, buy the latest software, hardware, or whatever appliance you desire. The difficulty comes with finding the skills to operate and to integrate. This is really the challenge clients face today; finding the skills to keep pace with an increasing rate of change in technology. This problem can be seen in increasing spending on IT and data centers, filled to capacity with great technology, but no way to use it because the skill level is not there. This challenge becomes even more apparent with open-source software. Around the world, the public and private sectors clearly realize the benefits of open-source software; little to no licensing costs, protection from being held hostage by a vendor, the ability to attract talent to the organization, and so on. There is a wide range of extremely powerful open-source programs ready for use, but the problem is that they are neither coordinated, nor integrated, and as they get upgraded, sometimes on a weekly basis, it is extremely difficult to maintain and use them. I am a big believer in open-source software, but if you do not have the skills and experience to integrate and maintain the systems, you will find yourself in trouble. The current push toward big data solutions is a great example of this. A big data solution needs at least seven independent open-source components all working together in a tightly coupled bundle just to get started, and today there is no single standard for putting all these pieces together consistently and, more importantly, as yet, there is no one single distribution method that has emerged as a standard. I am sure this will change with time, but today this is the reality. You need someone with the right skill set and level of experience to build and continually maintain a workable solution for you, unless of course you are a Facebook or Google with 50 Stanford PhDs on staff.</p><h4>What economic trends are providing the biggest opportunities for GBM?</h4><p>The construction boom is a huge boost to our business because both public and private businesses are building new data centers, new offices, and all are required to be future proof from a technology perspective. In that respect, we design solutions with upgradability in mind. Establishing the network and communications infrastructure is the first step. Next comes the computer infrastructure and application architecture, and this is a very interesting area for me, as we are seeing a change from computer-centric to data-centric design. It is important to realize that the very nature of IT is changing, from the consumerization of IT, through to the increasing velocity, variety, and volume of data in our world, which is driving an upheaval in the way we think of IT, and what we expect from our IT departments. Even apparently simple constructs like data centers are being challenged, and you only have to look at how Google, Apple, and Amazon design their data centers now to see this—they are built to be ecologically sound, allow for expansion, and have highly secure, cloud-based infrastructure. The last thing you want to do is design a new data center based on outdated 1990s design philosophies.</p><div class="quote">“  Here, the government recognizes the value of data and its importance for research. "</div><h4>Will the issue of data integrity grow in importance over the coming years, in your opinion?</h4><p>I believe people realize that they are using free applications and understand that they are handing their data over to companies. People do not mind doing this because they have an expectation that their data is secure. If a company betrays your trust and does not have your data stored securely, then it will lose its clientele quickly. Do not underestimate the importance of this. Most organizations have rigorous backup and protection mechanisms in place for their own data, but tend to overlook customer-generated data, often relegating it to cheap, unreliable, low-cost commodity storage. This is a recipe for disaster.</p><h4>What do you make of government efforts to promote advances in the IT sector?</h4><p>If you are doing research into complex topics like diabetes, the role of the government in healthcare becomes a key determinant of the data you can use. The government is encouraging people to come here and develop world-class applications by opening up its data to attract researchers. In a way, data protection limits research opportunities, particularly when it comes to genetic predispositions to disease. Here, the government recognizes the value of data and its importance for research. The government has information that the right people could use for the betterment of society.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the vision behind Knowledge Oasis Muscat (KOM)?<br></h4><p>It started in 1995 when Oman developed Vision 2020, which focused on diversifying the economy away from oil and gas. In 2001, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry took the initiative through our parent organization the Public Establishment for Industrial Estates (PEIE) to build KOM as a hub for technology in the country. At that time a lot of roles had been given to KOM, and then other government organizations were spun off, like the Information Technology Authority and The Research Council, which helped KOM gain more focus on attracting investment and contributing to the success of the ICT sector and its role in the national economy. We started KOM in 2003, and since then we have been able to attract almost 120 companies to the park.</p><h4>How do you go about promoting KOM to investors?</h4><p>Internationally, we put ourselves on the map of technology parks by getting ourselves into all the big international organizations like the International Association of Science Parks (IASP), based in Spain. Of course, we do a lot of road shows and marketing for Oman in general, and KOM in particular. We try to focus on the region mainly, and we are moving into a wider spectrum in Europe, which is why we have a blend of multinational organizations working here in the park, like Microsoft, Ericson, NCR, HP, Oracle, and Huawei, just to name a few.</p><h4>How important is it to offer 100% foreign ownership at the park?</h4><p>It has been one of the most valued incentives for all investors. Since we started KOM, one of the key incentives that we offer is 100% ownership. We have been able to attract not only the blue-chip organizations but even SMEs and start-ups, which value not only these incentives, but admire the facility and services that KOM is offering. The availability of flexible office space helps KOM attract call centers, and we currently host Qatar Airways International's call center, Oman Air's call center, NCR's ATM monitoring call center, and other commercial call centers. What makes KOM unique is its ability to link itself with the education cluster and industry. The education cluster based in KOM is represented by Middle East College and Waljat College, accommodating more than 4,000 students. The chemistry between companies and the education cluster based in KOM is the reaction of what we inject in terms of job creation opportunities and shaping and tuning technical skills with the latest technology within both clusters. The advantage being a subsidiary of the PEIE, which runs and manages seven industrial estates in Oman, and the location of KOM next to one of the largest industrial estates, creates huge opportunities not only in building the bridge between industry and R&amp;D centers in the education cluster within KOM and Oman, but also in generating a lot of business opportunities that the PEIE is offering.</p><h4>What is The Knowledge Mine?</h4><p>An entrepreneurial cluster was created in 2004 called The Knowledge Mine (TKM). It is a business incubation program meant to introduce new business people to the market and reduce the failure rate in start-up companies by providing practically free furnished office space and a series of mentoring and counseling workshops during the three years of incubation as well as after graduation. TKM also provides business-networking events at which business matchmaking occurs between TKM members and government and business organizations. In 2012, we started working to create a wider spectrum in terms of services for the entrepreneur, including a program called the National Business Center. This new program will focus on shaping the main skill sets of entrepreneurs early with regard to doing business.</p><h4>How many companies are in TKM?</h4><p>The maximum capacity of TKM is 15 companies at a time, and we keep them for a minimum of three years. Over the last five years TKM has hosted almost 22 companies, some of which broke the shell and moved out of TKM as they grew up in terms of number of employees and balance sheets. The total capital investments of these companies reach OMR1.3 million. We are always proud to tell the success stories of TKM; we have entrepreneurs who started with OMR50 and now the worth of their companies' has reached hundreds of thousands. Some companies also take their services abroad.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Port of Salalah developed and grown in recent years?</h4><p>The interesting aspect of the Port of Salalah in an Omani context, and even regionally, is that it is purely market driven. Two shipping lines approached the government suggesting a world-class container port in that particular location. Because of this, it was almost a guaranteed success. If the market says there is a huge need and is willing to invest its own money, then further business will follow. Since the launch of operations in 1999 until 2012, the results are 665% growth in container volume and over 600% growth in general cargo volume. There are massive opportunities for the location and for the country. The company was formed in 1997 by a joint venture between the Omani government and two of the largest international shipping lines—Sea-Land and Maersk—and immediately listed on the Muscat Security Market (MSM). Between 1999 and 2001, A.P. Mí¸ller went through a series of acquisitions and restructuring, and what emerges today is APM Terminals, one of the world's largest terminal operators for both inland and onshore terminals. It is a 30% shareholder and manages the day-to-day operations at the port. The entire weight of the A.P. Mí¸ller group and its expertise in all areas is behind the Port of Salalah.</p><h4>How significant is your relationship with APM Terminals?</h4><p>We have access to expertise, training materials, and learning experiences from other ports. At the same time, there is also a major advantage for APM Terminals in having Port of Salalah in its portfolio, because it is a multi-user facility that is focused on the market. We bring commercial connections to the table. It has been a very good relationship on both sides. Omanization in skilled jobs at the Port of Salalah is 70%, and we are very pleased that today the majority of mid-level and senior staff are locals. We actively train Omanis by sending them to work in other ports around the APM Terminals' network in addition to bringing in world-class expertise to train our people here in Oman. They also participate in our management training programs at international business schools like IMD or APM Terminals' internal development courses such as MAGNUM and RMDP, where the aspiring leadership travels for training at several ports over the years for development in leadership, port operations, commercial and financial skills, and more.</p><h4>How did the port perform in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012, we had a fantastic year, growing by 13% on the container side and 11% on the general cargo side. We achieved 3.62 million TEUs, which is the highest that the port has ever achieved. We also handled 7.2 million tons of general cargo, which is again the highest that the port has ever handled. Now, we are starting an expansion that is going to be completed by the end of 2013. It will give us far more capacity on the dry bulk side, but it will also triple our liquid bulk capability, which has become a very popular product. We have already essentially pre-sold around 65% of that capacity. The expansion will give us 1,200 meters more berth. However, in reality what it will do is allow us to really support local businesses, such as the mining companies in particular on the dry bulk side, to increase their volumes drastically. We expect to double our mineral dry bulk throughput by mid-2015. Right now, we have just over 2 million tons of liquids handled annually, and I expect that will be 4.5 million tons by the time the expansion is operating in its first year.</p><div class="quote">“  A successful free zone is in the port's interests, and vice versa. "</div><h4>How important is the success of the Salalah Free Zone for the port?</h4><p>It is absolutely vital. To me, it is not about how much money gets invested in an area, but about how much activity a company will see through the local economy annually. A successful free zone is in the port's interests, and vice versa. Without the port's direct connectivity to 60 global markets by over 3,200 ships annually, the free zone customers would have a difficult time transporting their products to markets. Supporting the free zone in attracting businesses to set up in Salalah is one of the pillars of our strategy. We have grown our Commercial Department by 200% to support that.</p><h4>How does investment in technology affect the port's operational success?</h4><p>We have millions of dollars in technology investments ongoing. We have just finished the development of a new terminal operating system for our general cargo terminal, which will add value to the port and to our customers, who will be able to receive real-time information on their commodities and vessels. This will allow the customers better efficiency out of their supply chain and improve their competitiveness. Furthermore, on the container terminal side we have had the market leader in terminal systems, NAVIS, installed for years. It uses algorithms to reduce the driving distances of the trucks at the port, positions the vessels along the berth in the best spot possible to reduce the overall cost of operations, and automatically assigns jobs to the most efficient location or staff member. The port has just signed a contract to install differential GPS units in all of our equipment to ensure the highest levels of efficiency and planning. All of these investments are just the foundation for a platform called SmartYard, which APM Terminals has developed. Now that we have optimized the ships and the trucks, SmartYard will optimize the yard cranes and allow a reduction in waste of up to 30%, which translates into cost savings for our customers. At the same time, we are also working together with the government on putting 70 yard cranes onto the electrical grid rather than having them driven by diesel engines, which will save the environment around 16,000 tons of CO2 a year, and save the government more than $2 million a year in fuel subsidies. There is further technology investment in other sections of the business that will take us closer to our goal of being the port of choice that local and global customers use to connect their businesses.</p><h4>What advantages do shipping lines stand to gain from utilizing the port?</h4><p>The shipping lines gain automatically because they utilize the Port of Salalah as a hub, making us a network that can save them time and money. The Port of Salalah provides the fastest connection times to the Indian Ocean Basin and throughout the entire East African-Indian Gulf with the main trade lanes of Asia and Europe. That is where shipping lines can save their money, by taking these huge ships that generally have great economies of scale, and using a central location to get as close to the final market locations as possible. These network savings reach into the tens of millions of US dollars annually. Additionally, local Omani businessmen can use the backbone of the network to reach their markets. We provide major value to the lines, and then the local businesses get to piggyback on that.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[wave-to-speedy]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has National Ferries Company (NFC) developed since its inception in 2008?<br></h4><p>NFC is a marine transport company established in 2008 to provide services for Omani citizens and residents linking the long coastal areas of the Sultanate by sea. The high-speed ferry service was initially intended to cover 12 ports nationwide, in addition to other economically feasible international destinations in the region. The number of intended ports of call has since increased to 14. NFC launched the initial passenger-only service from Muscat to Khasab in August 2008, upon the delivery of the Shinas catamaran. Vehicle transportation was not possible at that stage as the support infrastructure, such as vehicle ramps at destination ports, was not in place. Since we launched vehicle transport services between Muscat and Khasab, we have seen a steady growth in passenger traffic. We have brought into service three new vessels: the Hormuz, Sawqrah, and Al Hallaniyat. The second route from Khasab to Lima commenced in October 2011, utilizing the medium- to high-speed ferry, a Sawqrah-class vessel. Subsequently, the Shinas-Khasab-Shinas service was launched in May 2012, with passengers and vehicles catered to from day one.</p><h4>What has been the response to NFC's offering in Oman?</h4><p>Passenger throughput has shown steady growth since the inception of the services. Annual figures for the last three years, from 2010, 2011, and 2012, indicated actual throughput of 10,615, 19,820, and 34,782 passengers, respectively. In terms of load factor, gradual growth was the norm annually, with 2012 registering a 50% load factor. We are likely to see continued annual growth with further marketing and sales efforts from the management. The first four months of 2013 witnessed an upsurge in load factor, rising to 70%. On a similar note, we have seen growth in the carriage of vehicles; 2012 registered 113% growth in “ro-ro" vehicle movement, at 5,568 units, compared to 2,610 units in 2011.</p><h4>What are NFC's current routes, and what opportunities are there to expand?</h4><p>NFC is currently in the process of building up the infrastructure for high-speed ferry operations in the Port of Dibba in order to facilitate the launch of potential services connecting Dibba with the Musandam region (Khasab) and the Al Batinah region (Shinas). NFC is currently in the process of finalizing a feasibility study on an international route linking ports in Oman with Iran. Potential lines could be Khasab-Bandar Abbas and/or Qeshm in the near future, in line with the opening up of the transit corridor under the Ashgabat Convention between Oman, Iran, Qatar, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. High-speed ferry operations in the South of Oman present another possibility, linking Salalah to Halaniyat Island or Hasik ash-Shuwaimiyah to Halaniyat Island, for example.</p><h4>How does NFC support the government's efforts to encourage tourism in the Sultanate as part of Vision 2020?</h4><p>NFC takes an active role in supporting the government's vision to encourage tourism in the Sultanate of Oman as part of Vision 2020. Through the scheduled trips, our services showcase the majestic coastline of Oman to discerning tourists, locals, and expatriates. Omani culture and hospitality is present from the moment the guest steps on board to enjoy the excellence in service culture and the characteristics of Oman. Our marketing and sales efforts overseas—at international conferences, exhibitions, and roadshows—showcase not only our ferry services, but also Oman as a unique destination. As part of its corporate social responsibility, NFC continues to sponsor various social, education, and sporting events.</p><h4>What is the significance of the planned conversion of Port Sultan Qaboos for NFC?</h4><p>The transformation of Port Sultan Qaboos into a tourism-based, mixed-use waterfront destination provides opportunities for NFC in its future development and growth. Muscat draws the bulk of Oman's tourist visits; the port is the natural choice for transformation into a tourism gateway. This will be especially true after this consolidation of tourism-related activities in one location. The dedicated berth and terminal for NFC augurs well—it provides an opportunity for an enhanced experience for passengers and ease of vehicle passage for NFC customers. Muscat's hospitality, retail, and food and beverage development complements and provides potential customers for NFC and promotes the development of cruises in the vicinity, which is part of NFC's strategy going forward.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How involved are you in the planning and design process of new airports?<br></h4><p>We are very involved in the design process and have a particular influence on how the airports will be operated. Oman Airports Management Company (OAMC) carries out an extensive program for operational readiness in preparation for the new airports. Our main focus is on employing, recruiting, and training Omani nationals to add to the 600 staff members at the existing airports. In the end, we expect to manage around 1,700 staff. Currently, about 90% of the workers are Omani, and that will be the case for the new airports as well. This is a challenge because the new airports are technologically a step ahead for the country; they are state of the art, modern, and world class, equipped with all of the latest technology. Our approach is to maximize the number of Omanis on the team (supplemented by a few experienced expatriates), with a handful of specialized services outsourced to contractors. In terms of how the new airports will be operated, the government has made it very clear that it expects high standards of service. The government requires us to operate the airports in a way that meets the highest international standards.</p><h4>How much of the operation of the airports will you be contracting to other companies?</h4><p>OAMC is contracting high-level IT support and the operational maintenance of the automatic baggage handling system, which is a very complex, computer-driven software system with which we have no experience. However, even when we outsource work, part of the contract stipulates that the contracted companies will train Omanis so that they are prepared to manage the work ourselves within a few years. In Oman, the Public Authority of Civil Aviation manages air traffic control, the Royal Oman Police operates security, immigration, and customs, and OAMC contracts Oman Air to conduct the ground handling of aircraft, cargo handling, and flight catering.</p><h4>How would you describe the demand for air traffic in Oman at the moment?</h4><p>Typically, there is an average of 15%-16% growth per annum in passenger numbers, which means it is doubling every five years. That is rapid growth by anyone's standards. What we are finding is that growth is coming from everywhere—not just one particular market such as China or Europe. The Indian Subcontinent is a major market for us, while the GCC countries are growing as well. The growth is mainly driven by GDP and economic expansion, meaning that there is more business travel, more migrant workers, and with the increased prosperity in the country, more Omanis are choosing to travel by air.</p><h4>Do you think that freight handling will expand across the board once Duqm Port has opened?</h4><p>Sea-to-air freight is a huge opportunity for Oman. Salalah is a major container port, and essentially a transshipment hub. We expect that in due course, Duqm will also develop in that direction. Oman is taking advantage of its strategic position. We see huge potential for the sea-to-air business, and the driving force behind this possibility is the faster delivery of products to Europe. We could save a week or two of transportation time by carrying out the last leg of the trip by air. We are working together with the Port of Salalah and the airline companies to develop that business.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the air traffic industry in Oman?</h4><p>We believe there are many airlines, both passenger and cargo oriented, that are aware of our capacity constraints. When the new airport is open, then there will be plenty of publicity and an upward curve in terms of passengers and flights. In 2012, we transported 7.5 million passengers, and in 2013 we expect to move 8.5 million. We expect to be operating with 10 million passengers per annum when we move into the new airport in Muscat, and that new airport is designed to handle 12 million. However, the facilities can accommodate up to 24 million passengers, and it will be very easy to expand the rest of the airport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Can you tell me about the growth and development of DHL in Oman?</h4><p>Oman is an interesting market. We are very close to Dubai, which presents both benefits and drawbacks. One negative aspect is that the retail sector and a number of other sectors in Oman cannot grow as quickly as they can in Dubai. Everyone is buying products from the UAE, and it is not difficult to go and come back. Two people could easily establish a trucking company and do business between Dubai and Oman. Competition against this traditional model in the local market is very difficult. However, 60% of the country's export income comes from oil and gas, and that is why energy is an indicator for the economy. The UAE, the US, Europe, China, and India are large trading hubs for DHL Express. The oil and gas industry's deadline is always yesterday, which fits well with the speed of our company. DHL Express is fast as we have our own aircraft and transportation system, solutions in Bahrain and Dubai, and state-of-the-art transportation and models. Our unmatched level of quality is what sets us apart in the market.</p><h4>What other industries do you serve?</h4><p>Automotive spare parts companies, construction-related companies, and the government are our largest customers. We are involved in a number of huge road, bridge, port, and infrastructure projects. However, about 65%-70% of our customer portfolio is related to oil and gas. What is also important for us is the new airport, because it will serve the country in a very positive way. Oman has a fantastic chance to open a commercial border with Saudi Arabia and, thus, grab business from the UAE. Currently, we see the transit business passing through Africa and the Middle East. After this new infrastructure is established, Oman will have the opportunity to take advantage of the new airport. The export-import business is an excellent way to attract huge shipments from the Far East and the other countries that can then be passed on to Saudi Arabia. DHL believes in this new possibility, and we are aiming for developments that are in line with this projection. Muscat Airport could play a very interesting role in terms of East African countries and trade, and Oman has strong historical ties in the region. DHL is looking to expand upon that. In March 2013, we brought the first DHL aircraft to the country. This is a historical time for the country because our competitors are still using 1970s-model trucks, and we brought a brand-new aircraft to Oman. This is testament to the fact that we are very much in line with Oman's up-and-coming logistics requirements.</p><h4>Do you see Duqm as an area for expansion?</h4><p>Duqm is very important for us. It may not be today, or even in 2015, but someday Duqm will play a very important role in Oman. Our sister company, DHL Supply Chain, has already started investing and very soon DHL Express will be opening its offices. Currently, the market is not for the retail market, more for shipyards and other technical industries. However, the commitment level will be there.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the logistics industry in Oman?</h4><p>Logistics in Oman is a huge opportunity. It is a big county bordering Saudi Arabia, with access from Duqm Port, Sohar Port, and Salalah Port, and the soon-to-be built industrial city in Barka. However, we do have a weakness in terms of logistics-educated staff. For that, we are introducing graduates from universities unrelated to logistics areas and teaching, educating, and monitoring their progress. Oman is a safe, stable, and politically peaceful country—it is not dangerous here.</p><h4>What is your strategy for the growth of DHL in Oman?</h4><p>In 2013, we received the CEO of DHL, which sent the clear message that DHL wants to invest more in Oman. We are following the airport project closely and working together with its cargo facilities. This rapid growth is something that people won't necessarily see. If all parties are able to manage it properly, the airport could become a huge money machine and promote a good image for Oman. We see a green light in Oman, especially in terms of investment and logistics.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY How has Al Madina Logistics developed and evolved over the past six years?<br></h4><p>The company is considered young compared to well-established logistics companies, but we have a very clear aim to be among the top leaders of third-party logistics provision. We have studied all the best practices around the world that provide the best logistics services in terms of performance, facilities, and equipment. We reviewed the same with our consulting engineers to design and build one of the best world-class distribution facilities in Oman. As a third-party logistics company, we provide full supply chain services that include freight services, transportation, warehousing, a container yard, and much more. Our shipping and freight-forwarding department has extensive local coverage and a global network with leading shipping and freight-forwarding companies. The transport department has a complete fleet of trucks that can handle and transport any kind of goods. One of the main features is a trailer that has an in-built crane to load and unload containers by itself. We also have special trailers that extend up to 21 meters in length. Furthermore, we have a connection with international heavy-lift firms that have capabilities to transport 5,000 tons of equipment. All of our trucks are equipped with GPS and IVMS systems to track all movement and monitor truck performance. The warehouses are operated with world-class inventory management systems that manage each client's products. It has full capabilities to manage various product types such as food, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and more.</p><h4>Have you seen demand rise in recent years?</h4><p>Oman enjoys continuous growth in all business sectors. This has supported the rise in the demand for other services such as logistics. Despite the financial crisis around the world, GCC countries were able to sustain growth trends, especially Oman. The government has increased the budgets of new infrastructure projects, and all these need logistics support. We try to provide quality and unique services that guarantee high standards, especially for food products, as we sustain high-quality temperature control up to -25° Celsius. All of our trucks are equipped with temperature-control chips to monitor the supply chain and maintain the correct rate.</p><h4>With regards to ports, is sea-to-air-to-road logistics a big opportunity for you?</h4><p>Yes. With Oman having a very strategic location, the opportunities are great. Salalah Port is already receiving direct calls from the main shipping lines, and Sohar Port has also started to get direct calls. Port Sultan Qaboos is still getting feeder ships that are coming from UAE ports and others. With six new airports, especially the ones in Muscat, Salalah, and Sohar, as well as the new expressways and future railway project, the Sultanate has great outlook for connectivity in a more economical way.</p><h4>Efficiency is very important for ports. How does Al Madina Logistic Services Company help in this regard?</h4><p>All Omani ports have excellent infrastructure and equipment. Efficiency is a very important part of the success of these ports. What is lacking is the efficient management and smooth operational system. Along with high fees being charged by the ports, unfortunately we see more and more shipping lines using neighboring ports.</p><h4>How important is your international network?</h4><p>To provide the best supply chain solutions, we have to have an excellent international network. With such connections, we can provide the best logistics solutions to our clients in terms of quality of service, the timeline for deliveries, and dependability at the best competitive prices. Hence, the network connections are very critical for a business such as ours. We also act the same way for our international partners as we facilitate their needs in the local market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Shipping developed since starting in 2003?<br></h4><p>Oman Shipping Company was formed because there was a large volume of exports being moved on a freight-on-board (FOB) basis, where the buyer is responsible for the shipping, which meant we were losing the opportunity for a great deal of trade. Oman Shipping Company adds to the value chain of the Sultanate. For Omani producers, instead of shipping cargo only as far as the terminal, through Oman Shipping Company products can be delivered directly to the customer. We started in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector, as all of our LNG was done on an FOB basis with around seven vessels, exporting predominantly to Japan and Spain. We have since decided to expand into the export of other products, such as chemicals and various refined oil products. Our portfolio basically consists of LNG vessels, product tankers, very large crude carriers (VLCCs), bulk carriers, and, recently, container ships. We are now quite diversified in terms of our shipping fleet. We currently operate about 42 vessels, whereas in 2003 we only had one vessel. Oman Shipping Company is fully owned by the government, 80% by the Ministry of Finance and 20% by Oman Oil Company, itself owned by the Ministry of Finance. One of the key strategies behind Oman Oil Company's participation as a shareholder is because it is the government's arm for investing in the energy sector, and so we are involved in many of its projects. Our major focus is on Oman and imports and exports, but if we do find opportunities where it makes sense for us to go ahead outside, then definitely we will do it. We are heavily involved in the imports and exports of Oman, and our key strategy is to enhance them.</p><h4>How do you cope with fluctuating global oil prices?</h4><p>Many of the vessels in our portfolio are on long-term charters, and so we are generally not affected by any fluctuation in the market. When the markets are low you maintain appropriate chartering, though whenever the market is high, you still get the fixed rate; this is a kind of long-term strategy. We do have a small portfolio that is subject to the market, and especially the crude market, which is very cyclical. Today's market for crude oil shipping is not what we would like it to be, but this will change. For example, before 2008, we were looking at rates over $100,000 a day just to charter one of these vessels. Today, we are talking about $7,000 to $20,000. The main reason for this is there was an oversupply of vessels as the market was high.</p><h4>Where do you trade in the world?</h4><p>Our vessels trade worldwide. LNG is quite specific, however. It goes to Japan and Spain, and sometimes it goes to China when you have diversion cargoes. Fundamentally though, we do not control where the product goes. Our role is to provide the vessel, and make sure it is manned and technically managed—it is the charter who decides where to take it.</p><h4>How will Duqm build Oman's standing as a maritime hub?</h4><p>With Duqm Port, the authorities are trying to attract what they call mother vessels; huge containers that, instead of going to Jebel Ali, could stop at Duqm and save a huge amount of time. What they are trying to do is to have Duqm as the area to gather all these containers and then redistribute them through what they call “feeder vessels," like a trans-shipment port. But they also need to take into consideration the biggest competitor in the area, which is Jebel Ali, and which has the necessary infrastructure to support all major vessels in terms of logistics and services around the port's activities. Hopefully, we will be able to provide the same kind of infrastructure. Once we have the railroad, I am sure we will take a lot of business from Jebel Ali, because it is a lot more economical for the larger boats to come to Duqm, or even Salalah, than continuing on round the coast to Jebel Ali. The biggest advantage for the country is its strategic location. If you look at the Strait of Hormuz, it is a narrow corridor and a busy lane.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the vision of Duqm develop?</h4><p>The government of Oman and His Majesty feel that during the past 40 years we have developed many of Oman's regions, and now it is time to focus on the Al Wusta Governorate. We are doing this by taking advantage of Duqm's strategic location to create a first-class industrial zone with associated free zones and a large port. That is the reason we have built one of the biggest ports, around 140 square kilometers in size, in the Middle East and North Africa. The free zone itself is around 1,777 square kilometers, which is also one of the largest in the MENA area. The strategic location means we can attract shipping lines, and the port can serve the Far East and our neighbors in India, Pakistan, East Africa, Europe, and the GCC. The zone we have designed is also more integrated, with individual subzones, including tourism, training and education, logistics, ports, the dry dock, light and heavy industrial fishing, and cement and building materials. The zone will also have an international airport with cargo capabilities, as well as a train station, through which most of the goods coming through the port will be transported to neighboring countries.</p><h4>How far through the construction process is Duqm currently?</h4><p>The dry dock is working at full capacity. The port already started commercial activity, though on a limited scale. The dry dock is being managed by a South Korean Company, DAEWOO, while the port is being managed by the Port of Antwerp. The government of Oman and the Port of Antwerp have established a joint venture, the Port of Duqm Company, which is running the port. Even when the work is finished, there will still be a lot more to do, especially in storage and logistics. Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) and other oil companies have started to use the port to ship and transport large equipment to their oil fields in and around Duqm. This equipment comes in through the ports of neighboring countries at great cost to the companies. Duqm Port will reduce the distance and cost of transportation. Other logistics companies, including DHL, have expressed an interest in setting up an office in Duqm.</p><h4>Are you looking to redirect business to your port from other operators or generate new business?</h4><p>The business generated by this new port and its attendant facilities will be new business for Oman. Duqm will complement the existing ports in Oman, as the government of Oman has planned a specialist capability for each port. Salalah specializes in transportation, Muscat in cruise ships, Sohar is industrial, and Duqm will concentrate on cargo plus other things. We will complement each other, working for the benefit of Oman. Duqm's greatest advantage lies in its size; we will not face the problems that others face regarding expansion, because we have dedicated a huge area of land. Duqm is built on a greenfield site on which there were no houses or buildings.</p><div class="quote">“  The free zone itself is around 1,777 square kilometers, which is also one of the largest in the MENA area. "</div><h4>How important will the refinery be?</h4><p>The refinery will add tremendous value to Duqm. It is already doing so, with many companies already doing studies so they can start construction in 2014. It is projected that by the end of 2017 the refinery will be in operation. Oman Oil is playing a big role in the development of Duqm with its investments in the refinery, petroleum jetty, and petrochemical industries. We are happy with the overall progress in Duqm and feel confident about job creation for Omanis.</p><h4>How important is tourism for the diversification of Duqm's economy?</h4><p>The coastline in Duqm is extremely clean because it is far away from population centers and less affected by pollution, meaning it is an ideal area in which to promote tourism. We have a special zone for tourism with 26 square kilometers and 18 kilometers of beaches, which is not small. The Crown Plaza Hotel is already completed and there are plans for further hotels. We have a request from other investors to build a waterpark in Duqm. It is not finalized, and discussions are ongoing, but we can use that to make it more attractive for tourists. To make it more attractive we need to link it by train. This authority was established 13 months ago and we have already managed to link Duqm with Muscat by plane three times a week. We'd like to see it on a daily basis to make Duqm a weekend getaway destination. Our airport will cater to both domestic and international passengers and cargo, attracting tourists from across the GCC. This is one of the visions of His Majesty; to create something huge to diversify the economy. The Duqm project will develop the Al Wusta Governorate, create jobs for Omanis, and contribute to the country's GDP. This is a region about which His Majesty has thought for a long time, and now we are implementing what he has in mind and we hope we can achieve his expectations for the country. Where there used to be a very low population, we now have at least 11,700 people carrying out different activities living in Duqm. All the properties in Duqm will be available for lease rather than ownership, and we don't have any restrictions when it comes to foreigners. It is a 100% foreign ownership zone.</p><h4>What initiatives are you making to preserve the natural beauty of the landscape?</h4><p>Oman is known for its beautiful natural assets. We were the first country in the Middle East to have a Ministry of Environment. His Majesty wants to safeguard the environment, so we have very strict environmental standards. Here in Duqm, we have kept the industrial plants far from the beaches and the tourism infrastructure. We have designed Duqm with this in mind, with a big buffer between each zone to avoid contamination. In addition, the wind in Duqm blows predominantly from the south to the north and sometimes from the west to the east, so we have placed the refinery downwind of the residential and tourism areas. The Ministry of Environment has been very helpful and has sent some of its staff to work with us to provide expertise and advice.</p><h4>How many jobs will Duqm create for Omanis?</h4><p>We expect the total population of Duqm to be around 67,000 by 2020. That is the expectation, and Duqm already has 11,700. The refinery is expected to draw in big numbers. Right now, there are about 31 companies with contractors or subcontractors working here. Because this is a specialized economy, we don't want to have a very rigid policy of Omanization. I feel that once we have a good training center in Duqm, we will see percentages beyond what we have planned. We have planned 20% and I am sure it will go beyond that. People want to see local people to help them communicate with the residents, locals, and neighbors. For example, in the dry dock, the Omanization percentage is good even though it is new. It has gone beyond 25%, and we are planning an even higher ratio.</p><h4>How are you promoting Duqm on the world stage?</h4><p>One way is through road shows, and another is through conferences. We also use our website and booklets. We have to be very careful because we don't want people to have too high expectations too early. We are still doing a lot of construction and building a lot of infrastructure. we are careful about promoting certain other areas where work is still required to make it ready for investors.</p><h4>When will the area be running at full capacity?</h4><p>I think by 2020 if we continue at the same speed. We can be proud that in these 13 months we have achieved so much. It would not have been possible without the full support of the entire government. We have full support from every ministry because we all want to meet the visions of His Majesty to put Duqm Special Economic Zone on the map.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is Oman building on its long historical relationship with the fishing industry today?<br></h4><p>We have ambitious plans to utilize the marine resources of Oman, given the long coastline and the huge resources available, especially in the Indian Ocean. We have recently seen a large plan approved with OMR500 million ($1.3 billion) of government funds to be pumped into fisheries. The plan incorporates four pillars. The first one is infrastructure development, such as fishing ports and factories. The second is the development of aquaculture and support facilities. The third is developing the fishing fleet as well as human resource development through training. The fourth pillar aims at the development of value-added products and developing markets for such projects. When it comes to infrastructure, we currently have 21 fishing ports along the coast. In the next five to six years, we aim to build another eight. By the end of 2020, there will be more than 30 fishing ports.</p><h4>How important is aquaculture to the Ministry's vision for the future of fisheries in Oman?</h4><p>Aquaculture is a program with huge potential for Oman that we started researching five years ago. We are looking into regulations and investment plans, and want Oman to be a major player in the Middle East in terms of fish farms. We have a long coastline with clean water, and the country is ideally placed geographically with excellent infrastructure, very stable financial and political systems, and a strong economy. Investors seek these qualities, and they will find them here in Oman. We are promoting this potential and we have started inviting investors in on projects with attractive incentives. When we floated invitations to investors, we received around 31 applications with a total value of investment of OMR150 million for projects ranging from shrimp and finfish to abalone, among others. We attracted a mixture of local and international investors, and have issued 19 permits with a total value of OMR128 million. Two of these projects will start soon: the construction of a shrimp farm and a farm for abalone and grouper. One farm will be in Sharqiyah, and the other is to be located in Dhofar in the south of Oman. The others are conducting feasibility studies and applying for environmental permits. Today, we produce approximately 150 tons of shrimp. We are hoping that by 2030, Oman will produce around 200,000 tons of fish, estimated at a value of almost close to OMR1 billion, which will benefit the Sultanate's income.</p><h4>What makes the fisheries industry important for Oman's population and economy?</h4><p>Fishing has been an important activity for the nation for thousands of years, and continues to be crucial even after the discovery of oil. One of the main economic activities that Oman focuses on is to diversify its income away from oil and hydrocarbons. It is very important from an economic point of view in terms of investment and generation of income. It is also very important from a social point of view, creating employment and stability for fishing villages and stopping migration from villages to cities. That is why we are building ports and infrastructure everywhere, even in remote areas. We want to make this occupation attractive by providing the support and facilities to make sure that it attracts younger minds. Finally, it is very important from a food security perspective. Oman is more than self-sufficient in fisheries. In fact, we are exporting 50% of our catch to the region and international markets. Fishing is very important from a social point of view, as it is a crucial economic activity. Currently, we have almost 45,000 Omanis working as fishermen. Another 10,000-12,000 work in supporting industries, in fish marketing, transport, and related services. And another 12,000 jobs will be created with the advent of the aquaculture sector in the next 20 years. Approximately 50,000-60,000 Omanis will be engaged in fishing. The average Omani family has seven members. Therefore, the dependency on fisheries is huge. In fact, 300,000-400,000 Omanis depend directly and indirectly on fishing activity.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Times of Oman, the Sultanate's original English-language daily, developed?<br></h4><p>In 1974, an English newspaper was perhaps just a dream for the people of Oman. The Times of Oman would not have come into being if a telex from Singapore had not reached the late founder, Essa bin Mohammed Al Zadjali's desk, while he was serving as Director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The much-talked-about telex came from a company called Flying Tiger Corporation based in Los Angeles, US, asking for over-flight permission and, as the director of the department, it was Essa Al Zadjali's duty to give permission to commercial, military, and individual flights flying over Oman. The telex sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was addressed; “Muscat, Oman, Saudi Arabia." Infuriated by the way the telex was addressed, Essa Al Zadjali had three days of soul-searching without taking any action on the request made in the letter. Soon, he convinced himself that it was not the mistake of the sender, but that something ought to be done to make the country known to the outside world. Of course, in the 1970s there were neither any radio nor TV stations. Essa felt that it was the absence of an English newspaper that kept Oman in obscurity. The idea of the Times of Oman germinated from this incident. Essa Al Zadjali contacted the concerned authorities and in 10 months' time, the paper was out on the stands. Oman witnessed the birth of the Times of Oman, the country's first English-language newspaper, in an exciting tabloid format on February 23, 1975. Having started off as a weekly, it grew to become a daily.</p><h4>How would you assess the Times of Oman's current market position and characterize its editorial exposition?</h4><p>The print media is in disarray across the world. But that is not the case in Oman, at least. It is true that the readership of the printed version of newspapers has been declining over the past several years. Yet, the Times of Oman, the most endearing newspaper in the Sultanate for decades, has been ruling the media scene. The newspaper, to say it with utmost humility, has defined news, set benchmarks, and reset the norms of journalism in Oman. The Times of Oman leads the market and its leading position has not changed since the day it was launched nearly 40 years ago. We, at the Times of Oman, enjoy the largest share of advertising revenue in this country. In the coming years, we aim to grow far ahead of the market. We would like to have much higher ratings with our readers.</p><h4>What is Times of Oman's readership profile ,and how is it evolving?</h4><p>Our newspaper continues to attract mostly expatriates, for obvious reasons. For most of them, the Times of Oman is a source of local information, announcements, and a way of connecting with this country. This factor has remained unchanged for years. But now, what is heartening is that we have more young readers and a lot of new generation Omani readers. We are moving well and are perfectly poised to reposition ourselves as demands change. We now consciously put out news that is of interest to local readers, too. We are focused on being reader-centric and building lasting partnerships with them, and continue to be the most preferred source of information. In more ways than one, the Times of Oman was, is, and will remain the official chronicler of the Sultanate.</p><h4>How would you rate the availability of quality journalists in Oman, and what opportunities exist for the media to provide employment to young Omanis?</h4><p>We have experienced journalists from across the world working with us. Until now, English journalism in Oman has been dominated by expatriates. This is slowly changing. With many of the local universities and colleges offering graduate and post-graduate courses in journalism and media studies, many young Omanis are showing keen interest in working in this sector. Plenty of opportunities are there for young Omanis aspiring to work in this industry. We are keen on providing a platform for aspiring journalists to start their journey in the field of journalism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[ground-up]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell me about the development of STFA in Oman?</h4><p>We started in 2000 via a port project in Sohar. Then, we were awarded 62 kilometers of the Quriyat-Sur road poroject. Before completing that assignment, we were awarded the Duqm Port project in a joint venture with Consolidated Contractors Company (CCC). Alongside these, we were also engaged in several small projects. In 2012, we were awarded the Bidbid-Sur road development. The name of the package is 1B. Recently, we were also awarded a fishery harbor in Salalah, Taka Fishery Harbor. We engage frequently in tenders and have several in the pipeline today.</p><h4>How involved has STFA been in the ongoing Duqm project, including current and future work, and what is your perspective on the importance of the development?</h4><p>We have been involved in the Duqm project through the construction of Duqm Port, which is already completed. We know how the Duqm project is important for Sultanate of Oman. Therefore, we shall continue to participate in the projects to be implemented in the near future. Also, STFA Investment Holding may come to this special zone as an investor.</p><h4>What is the value of your order books today?</h4><p>Since we arrived, we have completed around $750 million worth of projects in Oman. This figure is the STFA share, and does not include joint ventures. Our backlog now is about $300 million with the Bidbid-Sur project and around $40 million in the Taqah project.</p><h4>What attracted STFA to Oman?</h4><p>Oman is an attractive, stable, safe, and secure country. Security and transparency are very important for us. You can reach any information without obstruction and you can learn what is happening very easily. You can learn how and why you lose or win jobs, and this is a huge advantage for a company. Of course, we have some problems, but the government is listening and trying to solve these problems.</p><h4>How have the Omanization and minimum wage policies changed?</h4><p>Today, we are required to have 30% Omanization, and we follow that rule. The important thing is that we couldn't find enough qualified people to work in our jobs. We need to improve human resources in Oman, and the companies should improve as well. That is why we are implementing courses and training for our staff. This is a universal problem across the industry. The minimum wage has risen, and we are following that. The Oman Society of Contractors (OSC) is following up on this issue and is in discussions with the Ministry of Finance to find a solution to reimburse the cost increase for the contracts that were awarded before this regulation was implemented</p><h4>Are all your projects with the government?</h4><p>Yes, we don't have any private projects currently. At the moment, we are providing an offer on a private mining project, and if we get it that will be the first one we have taken from a private sector establishment. We are open to anything if we trust the company. We also did one job for PDO in a joint venture with a Turkish company, Fernas Construction. It was a successful venture and is already finished.</p><h4>How do you go about forging joint ventures?</h4><p>We are open to all joint ventures. If you want to share our risk and combine experience, we are open to other companies. We work with CCC, and for the Bidbid-Sur road project we are in a joint venture with the Habtoor Leighton Group (HLG). It is a Dubai-based company that was originally from Australia. Risk should be shared with someone. Competition is at a reasonable, logical level currently, but it is increasing and so the situation is deteriorating. This is the result of new international companies coming in. European and Turkish companies are coming in, and the competition is getting too high, which I think will continue.</p><h4>How do you find Oman's investment atmosphere as a foreign company?</h4><p>We are not an investment company; we are a contractor. Our investment is only our knowledge and in-country value. We source material from Omani suppliers, and machinery from Omani traders. These kinds of things can be named as an investment. If you are coming into Oman to set up a company, it is very good. I would advise it, and I do advise people to come.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the background of Target's involvement in the Omani construction sector?</h4><p>Target was started in 1976 as a small construction company, carrying out minor building projects. In the 1970s and 1980s, civil projects were primarily buildings, as the market demanded accommodation and offices. Road projects were also in demand and important because the country had to be linked up in order to assist its development. In those days, there was not a lot of demand for infrastructure projects such as water and sewage. However, since the late 1990s, this has changed, and such projects are vital to the country's development. Target stayed abreast of this trend, and such projects comprise of a large portion of our portfolio. While we continue to execute building projects, the infrastructure segment provides us with better returns. Constructing a building is relatively more straightforward than carrying out an infrastructure project, as the latter is more complex and requires a more rigorous and diligent approach in order to complete the job. A reflection of this is the tendering picture: one can almost always see many more bidders for buildings than for a water or sewage project.</p><h4>How has Target grown in the infrastructure construction sector?</h4><p>Our growth is a combination of market opportunities, and also our ability to make good on our commitments. We do not believe in growth for growth's sake, but in managed growth. We are not obsessed with numbers, be it the number of employees or the value of projects. Target might grow to double the size we are today, but this would not have necessarily result in better returns or performances. We place much more emphasis on making the best use of our resources, such as our workforce. Also, our key focus is on ensuring excellent project delivery and quality, and, therefore, a good relationship with our clients. An important point to mention is that we also price our bids realistically, and this, along with our technical credentials, maintains our credibility in the market. We are now moving into bigger and more complex projects that can further improve our reputation and competence.</p><h4>What is the composition of your current portfolio?</h4><p>Currently, around 80% of our active projects are in the water sector. These projects are in urban and rural areas, and the client is the Public Authority for Electricity and Water. The rest of our portfolio consists of buildings, the Diwan (Royal Court Affairs), and Petroleum Development Oman as clients.</p><div class="quote">“  We have a healthy project backlog and are optimistic for the future. "<br></div><h4>How has competition in the construction sector evolved in recent years?</h4><p>While the construction sector in Oman is large, competition today is very high, and particularly so in buildings and roads. While our bidding approach is selective in general, we are more stringent when we bid for a building project. Due to there being a lower number of bidders for infrastructure projects, one has a better chance of succeeding. Over the past few years, several companies from outside Oman have attempted to enter the sector, but very few have succeeded.</p><h4><br>How did the Arab Spring affect Oman's business environment?</h4><p>From a business perspective, an effect of the Arab Spring appeared to be a slowdown in the launch of tenders, as well as a slowdown in the awarding of projects. The payment of client dues takes longer than it used to, which affects our cash flow and operations. However, I am confident that this is only a temporary phase.</p><h4>Where do you see the growth opportunities for Target?</h4><p>Almost 95% of Target's contracts are with the public sector. I do not like working with the private sector. The cash incentive behind working with the private sector is neither sufficiently strong nor sufficiently reliable. I believe this country still needs a lot of development projects. The government, under the leadership of His Majesty, is sensible and is taking a pragmatic approach to projects. The Arabs actually have big plans with water and electricity transmission development projects. They are building strategic reservoirs for emergency water supplies. This presents us with a huge opportunity. Wherever we can bid on our own, we do so. In the past, we have lost a couple of jobs because we did not want to go on our own, but we are now much stronger. Our core operations are in the civil construction sector, and we intend for this to be our bread and butter. To complement this, we have begun to branch out into the electromechanical field, as well as metal fabrication, joinery, and earthworks.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Target?</h4><p>Our hands are full for the coming two years. We are still pricing and doing estimates, but we are concentrating on our major projects. Financially, we are very strong compared to our size. We have exceptionally strong liquidity. Our current ratio is around 1.8-1.9, which is very strong. We keep money in our company, and we distribute profits at a rate of around 30% or 40% every year. We started with around OMR5 million, and today we have OMR15 million-OMR20 million. We can now jump to OMR30 million on our own. Slowly but surely, we will make it. I am happy to be cautious in my approach. One day my son will take over, and I want him to be involved from now on. We have a healthy project backlog and are optimistic for the future. By continuing to build up our experience and reputation, we aim to bid for larger and more complex projects. Also, we expect success in our diversification efforts. Overall, we are confident of continuing to play a positive role in assisting Oman in its development.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the Ministry played in the rapid development of Oman's tourism industry in recent years?<br></h4><p>Since its formation in mid-2004, the Ministry has provided the institutional framework for the sector's development as well as leading the industry's development and marketing. In addition, in mid-2005, the Oman Tourism Development Company (OMRAN) was formed to accelerate the delivery of strategic infrastructure. As you can see, Oman is taking a managed approach to tourism with the government pro-actively involved in the demand and supply sides of the industry. The results of this work can be seen in several areas including the WEF's Travel &amp; Tourism Competitiveness Report 2013, which ranks Oman 57th in the world, up from 69th in 2009. In marketing to attract its visitors, Oman ranked 23rd, thus far ahead of many well-established tourism destinations.</p><h4>What initiatives are employed by the Ministry to promote niche areas of tourism such as yachting, eco, health, and spa tourism?</h4><p>Niche tourism is a major contributor to Oman's overall tourism performance. The Ministry and related government ministries have sponsored international conferences on responsible tourism, geo tourism, and recently a medical tourism exhibition and conference. Our next event is the Arab Aviation and Media Summit 2013, which we are co-hosting with Air Arabia in Salalah. The Ministry oversees the Oman Sail program, which promotes Oman's maritime heritage through competitive sailing. Yacht charter and watersports are also promoted through this platform. Spa tourism is expanding with a focus on our many coastal resorts from Jebel Siffah to the Six Senses Spa Resort at Zighy Bay and the Al Nahda Resort in Al Batinah. In addition to these, in early 2012 The Chedi Muscat opened a brand new spa and wellness center, while the Ministry is overseeing the development of the Six Senses Spa adjacent to the Ritz Carlton al-Bustan Palace Hotel.</p><h4>How does business tourism feature in Oman's future, especially in regard to the new convention and exhibition center coming online in 2016?</h4><p>Business tourism has been well established for many years, underpinned by a growing portfolio of domestic events and Oman's hosting of an increasing number of international conferences and exhibitions involving up to around 1,000 delegates. The Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre, with 3,200 seats and four hotels totaling 1,000 rooms, is a transformational project. It will allow Oman to host large international business and MICE events, and make a major contribution to the diversification of the industry from its hospitality base to one that involves a wider range of visitor segments in addition to strengthening Oman's tourism positioning. It is also recognized that the project poses many challenges. For example, we need to consider accommodation and tour options for large events, and how to spread the benefits of city-based business tourism to regional communities.</p><h4>Could you describe the Ministry's efforts to safeguard the environment?</h4><p>Our environmental efforts operate on three levels. At the international level, we are an active player in forums on sustainable tourism, for example hosting UNWTO and Responsible Tourism events in recent years. The Declaration on Responsible Tourism Destinations conference, hosted by the Ministry, led to a call by participants including UNESCO, UNWTO, and around 330 delegates, for all tourism agencies, businesses, and participants to take responsibility for ensuring sustainability is central to their business plans and daily operations. The Ministry provides a wide range of industry-related advice on climate change and advocates sustainable outcomes. We believe that this is gaining traction with more stakeholders adopting green building codes and alternative energy. Many resorts and hotels have ISO environmental accreditation, and the Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre is a LEED demonstration building. At the community level, the Ministry manages a schools program and participates in many community events, all of which have environmental content.</p><h4>What role will the tourism industry play in Oman's economic diversification?</h4><p>Tourism accounts for nearly 2.5% of GDP and contributes OMR650 million annually to economic activity. In the medium term, we expect tourism to account for 5% of GDP. In terms of FDI, the $1.6 billion invested in joint venture projects managed by OMRAN is a healthy indicator of investor interest in our sector, and our expectation is that the investment base will increase rapidly in the medium term.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has OMRAN grown since its inception in 2005?<br></h4><p>OMRAN was established in 2005, and I joined in 2007. The key challenge was to build up the team to deliver on the government's ambitious plans for the sector. This included establishing an asset management team, project development team, and a megaprojects team. We are 100% owned by the government, acting as its executive arm in tourism and real estate. This means we manage directly or through joint ventures all new projects and investments. We support the government in an advisory role in projects, marketing, and promotion. Our investment arm participates in joint ventures with domestic and international investors, and our focus over the next few years is on domestic tourism. We are looking at projects across the whole country, be it heritage, support, or leisure. The focus was previously on accommodation; however, now it is to provide something that is smaller and well rounded.</p><h4>What environmental initiatives does OMRAN promote?</h4><p>Our environmental initiatives stem from Oman's belief in the need to protect the environment. His Majesty has always been very keen on preserving the environment; therefore, architectural guidelines and restrictions are designed to protect and preserve the traditional culture of Oman, as well as promote the green agenda of the country. At the moment, there is a lack of understanding of green buildings; hence, we have been spearheading building awareness over the past few years. All of our new hotels will be constructed under green guidelines and obtain the internationally recognized LEED certification. This involves looking at buildings holistically from a design, construction, and operational point of view, so you can be assured their impact on the environment is minimized. We were the founding members of the Oman Green Building Council, so it is not just us building a few green buildings here and there, but trying to establish a body of knowledge within Oman so that others can make use of it to push the agenda within the municipality and the Ministry of Environment into the future.</p><h4>How instrumental will the government's investment in infrastructure be for the tourism industry?</h4><p>The expansion of the airports is the single most important development from our point of view. One of the main complaints we hear at the moment is that the airports lack capacity. The government is undertaking major expansion plans as well as building new airports, which will attract new business. For me, as far as tourism goes, it is the airline expansion and the airport that will help, especially for business tourism. When you are competing internationally to host an event with 5,000 doctors, engineers, or geologists, it is all about convenience. Our timing is fortuitous in that the airport and the Convention Centre will open almost simultaneously. We are looking at serious investment in Salalah because it has so much potential. Again, the expanded airport there will help tremendously, running more direct flights. There is existing infrastructure now in Duqm, with the port and the dry dock, and with the new free zone, which is going to create its own business. These are the destinations outside of Muscat that will benefit from heavy infrastructure investment in the future.</p><h4>What is your vision for OMRAN and for the wider tourism industry within the Omani economy?</h4><p>Our view as developers is the target for 2020, set back in 1995 at 3% of GDP, which has already been achieved today, some eight or nine years early. It is quite clear that this sector has a lot of potential, and, more importantly, it is a great job creator, because tourism is relatively inefficient in terms of manpower versus the high-tech industries of oil, gas, and manufacturing, which rely heavily on automated systems today. A $2 billion investment in oil and gas creates 300 or 400 jobs, whereas a $2 billion investment in real estate or tourism creates many times more than that. Our vision also has to be tied to projects that help alleviate some of the social and economic problems of the country. It is difficult to put a figure on, but I think even up to 10% of GDP is a reasonable target.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal background and how did the company come to Oman?</h4><p>We started Takamul as an initiative within Oman Oil Company (OOC) in 2006, and shortly afterward we began mapping out our business plan and targets, examining the raw materials available, exploring the market for downstream opportunities, and assessing the technology. We started our work with four people, and now we have close to 50. Takamul Investment Company was first incorporated in July 2008 with OMR10 million of paid out capital, and the figure has reached OMR100 million despite the financial crisis. We are a good example of the economic stability in Oman. We are entirely invested in the market—profitable and doing well. The company is competing, creating opportunities and new employment, and attracting investment and loans from local banks.</p><h4>How has your focus evolved?</h4><p>We began by seizing opportunities downstream from the aluminum mill and Oman Polypropylene, which is now part of ORPIC. Then, we considered opportunities at the refineries in Sohar and Muscat. We identified a number of projects that could be potential investments for us; our criteria were that they should be feasible, sustainable, and job creating. We want this activity to be integrated within the existing industries in an economically, financially, and environmentally sustainable way. We are working to create employment and a synergy with SMEs. Our focus was on raw material availability and we created industries for export. We then started targeting the local market for import replacement, and, thus, entered the service industry. Until then, many services were imported from outside, and knowledge and know-how were not retained in Oman. One industry that is commissioned regionally is the manufacture of galvanized steel wire. That is one project where the raw material is not available today, but the market is. We feel that 60% of that project could be supplied locally or regionally by Oman, the UAE, and Qatar.</p><h4>How important has Duqm been for your development?</h4><p>Considering how Sohar has developed to the point of saturation, we need to begin thinking about another area. Beyond Sohar, we are exploring new areas for future growth. There is huge potential for growth in Sohar, but on the long-term horizon, we need to establish a new area for growth and Duqm is the right place to do it. Taking into consideration our interest to leverage further on the strategic location of Oman on the open sea, we feel Duqm could also provide a more competitive advantage for large industries to allow for better-positioned import and export activities. Being a greenfield area, Duqm will allow us to expand much further away from existing residential zones.</p><div class="quote">“  We feel that 60% of that project could be supplied locally or regionally by Oman, the UAE, and Qatar. "</div><h4>What characterizes the sea intake system you are constructing in Duqm?</h4><p>Our experience in Sohar guided us to take control of the sea intake system from an early stage, where initially the government had taken responsibility for the development of the project. We are in discussions with the refinery, the government, and the authority to plan better for the seawater intake. Originally, we lacked a central focal point in Sohar for the provision of utilities—we scrambled to find investors arriving in Sohar who could offer telecoms, electricity, and water. There was no one-stop shop for utilities. In Duqm, we are working to plan and develop the corridors and the utilities in order to attract industrial companies and make life simpler. Specifically, we have targeted the steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, and refining clusters. The fisheries segment is another sector that has yet to be developed, so there are six clusters planned in Duqm. We would like to lead the discussion on the development of utilities for these industrial sectors. The provision of utilities is a long-term plan that requires large, advanced capital investment.</p><h4>What time frame do you have in mind for investment?</h4><p>When Takamul was initially created, we were not aiming to compete with local industries or investors. We were created to leverage and add value to the sector. We try to utilize the maximum amount of Omani workforce resources for operating and managing our plants. In the final stage of our investment, we divest part or all of our interest directly or indirectly to all of these industries. In collaboration with our shareholders, we are implementing a number of projects that have passed the development and construction phases and are entering the operational phase. The company is seeking to work with financial advisers to start divesting. That would most likely be carried out through private placement (pension funds) or an IPO. These will be part of the studies we are completing in the near future.</p><h4>How do you attract investment to Oman?</h4><p>To be honest, Oman does not require much advertisement when it comes to potential investment opportunities. Many people come and talk to us directly, and we partner with them on projects in Oman. We have received a huge amount of feedback for opportunities through local banks and government and consulting agencies, whether the work is financial or legal. These opportunities are usually created by international investors who have a business plan to invest in the region and are aiming to find the best place and partner. Another way we participate is by creating an idea and the investment opportunity. We identify an opportunity, develop it, then target the players in that industry globally. We focus mostly on technology or know-how, not specific countries. We are looking to attract long-term investments that are technically and economically feasible.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the downstream industry in Oman and its role in developing the economy?</h4><p>I see the government as a whole putting more effort into supporting the downstream segment. Downstream is more focused on SMEs, and the government is putting huge effort into developing these areas. The challenges we are facing will hopefully be resolved. The competitive advantage is that we are more technology-oriented, closer to customers, and more labor-intensive. Somehow, we need to come up with a structure to ensure that whatever SMEs and downstream industries we create here, we can combine them competitively in Oman.</p><h4>What is your vision for the next five years?</h4><p>Over the next five years, we will continue adjusting our targets. We base our strategy and vision on the past, and that means that we sometimes make mistakes. I know we are going to develop a number of projects in Duqm, but some of the projects we have carried out in the past six years were not even on our road map. As a target, I'd like the company to be twice as large as it is today in five years. If we were able to grow our capital by OMR100 million in five years during the economic crisis, our rate of progress should be easily tripled during the current economic boom.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you tell me about Hampton's position in the Omani market?<br></h4><p>We are a full service real estate consultancy. Hamptons was set up in Oman in the middle of 2000, when the global economy was looking brighter. The oil price was increasing at that stage, and it was a good economy to enter. Oman was the first foray into the Middle East for Hamptons. Our background in the UK was estate-agency-led, and that was a natural fit coming into Oman. However, it was very clear early on that there was a big gap in professional advisory services. It was very important for us to keep raising the bar for the real estate industry to bring in more professional feasibility work and valuations. From a very early stage, this was a key target for Hamptons. That is where we remain positioned; agency and professional divisions with our property management department in between, which has elements of both when advising clients. Our departments are not split into residential or commercial, as one tends to find in Europe; there are departments based on lettings, sales, valuation, strategic consultancy, and property management. Technically, if you look at our how our fees are split or our time taken up, it is not far off 50-50 between the two broad sectors of residential and commercial.</p><h4>Will the trend of young, employed Omanis driving up letting prices continue?</h4><p>I am not sure that there is a trend borne from young employed Omanis. It is true that there is a very young demographic, as there are in many of the GCC countries, and more pressure is being put on residential stock. However, the ability for a number of young Omanis to afford to buy or rent is questionable. The rental market is not as common in the Omani population—everybody wants to buy a house or land for a villa. Clearly, the ability to afford that and leverage yourself is quite difficult. People simply cannot afford the repayments of the mortgages or the amount of equity that is required to get a mortgage. Linking to that, Islamic banking is very new to the market and the expectation is that there are a number of unbanked people that will not bank conventionally and not borrow money conventionally; however, they are very keen to do so from an Islamic institution. Therefore, there is an expectation that the first six to 12 months of Islamic banking here will be very busy for the market, but what happens beyond that is unknown. There is enormous demand, but there is a disconnect with the affordability. The only thing that can happen with that pressure is sellers start reducing their prices. We are not at that pressure point yet, and Islamic banking will hold off that pressure point for a bit longer, but it needs to happen.</p><h4>Will the trend of integrated tourist complexes (ITCs) continue, and is that an opportunity for Hamptons?</h4><p>Yes, it is certainly an opportunity for Hamptons and our competitors. There are impressive fees to be earned from ITCs, whether from initial sales, renting, or further sales. What has happened with ITCs is that a lot of the re-sales and the new sales are to local Omanis who are looking for investment properties. The difficulties with ITCs in one sense, from a valuation perspective, is that the expected yields are really too low for the European market. You are looking at a villa where the net yield will be something like 4%. Currently, ITCs do not provide a genuine expectation of rapid capital growth in the market. From this bland perspective, ITCs as investments are, at the moment, slightly overpriced. However, the pride of private ownership is deeply ingrained in the psyche throughout the GCC and there is clearly a feeling that the quality of the properties within ITC projects guarantee future stability. ITCs are important to the market, and the Ministry of Tourism has granted land for a number of locations throughout Oman for ITC projects. The challenge for a lot of these projects is in the financing aspect, as many of these large-scale developments require the installation of massive infrastructure in the early days of the development. The infrastructure is costly and provides no immediate return on investment. That comes with future sales.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your personal background, and how did you come to be at Amouage?</h4><p>I have an extensive background in luxury goods. I started out in retail, on the fast-track promotion scheme at Liberty's of London, and have since held positions at various companies, taking in Simpsons of Piccadilly, Harvey Nichols, Dunhill, Pringle, and Ozwald Boateng. My métier in the latter half of my career became company or brand turnaround, and that is why I was interested in the opportunity presented by Amouage. This brought me out to Oman in 2006 to turn around the fortunes of the brand. I could see that Amouage's range of fragrances clearly had the potential to be marketed and retailed successfully on the world stage. The packaging of the products, however, was at that time too recognizably targeted to the Gulf market, and not relevant enough to the contemporary, international consumer. Amouage attracted me hugely, as my background in brand turnaround and product development led me to feel there was a genuine opportunity to create something unique.</p><h4>How has Amouage developed from its Omani origins into projecting an international retail strategy?</h4><p>Today, we are an international brand based in Oman. All our decisions are based on our international strategy. Britain, Russia, Europe, the Far East, and all our successful locations sell to indigenous audiences. You can never design for a specific region in this day and age with the amount of information available to everyone globally and with taste levels becoming homogeneous. I believe it is important not to define one's brand as being limited to any specific region, which is why we do not create products for any specific market or region. There has been a paradigm shift in retail and product development as international markets and consumer demands have converged. Of course, areas of the world have certain taste or product differences in desirability, but the overall message of any luxury brand is the same worldwide. Arab consumers have the same aspirations as consumers from other regions; they are all international consumers, particularly at the luxury end of the market where we operate. I believe that prior to my arrival and that of our Creative Director, Christopher Chong, Amouage had rather forgotten this and the product presentation had become rather irrelevant to today's consumer. Amouage today has a brand that is aspirational, relevant, and crucially displays a presence that will flourish in the international context. We sell around the world, from Sydney to Santiago, and we have created our own style rather than purely following trends. We are proud to be a brand with a Head Office based in Oman, but we now have five international sales offices around the world, all with product design, packaging, and branding created in London.</p><h4>What is the creative process behind Amouage's fragrances?</h4><p>We work with various producers across the world, in Grasse, Paris, New York, Geneva, and beyond. Our Creative Director Christopher Chong handles the entire design process for every fragrance, from conception to realization. His inspirational and creative brief, which kicks off the process, can take ideas from a myriad of sources, from music to literature, fashion, interior design, art exhibitions, and movies. Once the brief is created he then puts this to our “noses" to prepare their fragrance submissions. This can be anything up to 250 individual fragrances, all created to express the inspirational brief. There are then various meetings to adjust the intensity of certain notes until the final five fragrances are chosen, which are then reworked and refined until around two or three for each gender stand out. Only at the end of this arduous process of refinement and gradual elimination are the final perfumes presented to me, each with a male and female version. Then, Christopher and I ultimately decide together which fragrances will form the final two and will become the new fragrances for the coming year. We tend to launch two mainline fragrances (a men's and women's) per year and one Library Collection. The Library Collection is a really unusual juxtaposition of often rare or exclusively created notes that are presented as highly complex and unique fragrances. The Collection is Amouage's comparison to fashion's Haute Couture, and was developed to express the true mastery of perfume creation. The ongoing success of each launch within this Collection has surprised even me!</p><div class="quote">“  I believe it is important not to define one's brand as being limited to any specific region, which is why we do not create products for any specific market. "</div><h4>How would you characterize Amouage's fragrance collection today?</h4><p>Our fragrances certainly have their own voice. We do not follow trends in the choice of our collections as we believe we have, to a point, become trend makers, since we know some other brands follow us and try to replicate our fragrances as closely as possible. This we see as highly flattering, but of course we guard our product secrets and recipes very closely. Our fragrances tend to be oriental, and we have several wonderful chypres in our women's collections, but we also have amazing white florals and rose-based scents too, such as Honour and Lyric. We are renowned in our men's range for creating woody, spicy fragrances, one of the most successful being Epic for men. Our current product portfolio incorporates around 26 fragrances, of which seven are in the Library Collection. We believe that with our increasing collections we are now seen as an important player in the world of luxury “haute parfumerie."</p><h4>How important is the quality of ingredients in Amouage's fragrances?</h4><p>The ingredients we use are the best and often the rarest available. Throughout the whole development process the only focus of the perfumer is to create something beautiful and unique. At that stage, we do not consider the cost of the ingredients, as we believe our responsibility is to create something truly special. The cost only becomes an issue once the final fragrance has been chosen. This allows the noses to be highly creative, and we know that in this way we will get only the very best submissions from them. Our materials are sourced from all over the world, and working with Amouage is something the noses really enjoy, as they are allowed the opportunity to explore the most exotic ingredients. Only the finest of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are used in creating our fragrances. In fact, synthetic molecules are becoming very popular in the fragrance industry today because they provide limitless creative possibilities. The level of concentration we include in the fragrance of the actual perfume concentrate is, we believe, one of the highest in the world. I also believe that Amouage has the ability to move into other product categories that are accessory-related, but completely not restricted to fragrance. Of course, by increasing our retail presence, we are also able to add on product categories such as the bath and home collections and the recent addition of leather goods ranges, in high-grade calf and exotic skins, hand stitched by artisans in Florence, the home of the best quality leather goods in the world. Leather goods from Amouage have been readily accepted and are now proving to be successful with our consumers, which leads me to believe there may be other opportunities for diversification in the accessories market in the future, so I would say, “watch this space."</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the retail industry developed over the past decade?<br></h4><p>Over the last decade, there has been a very recognizable growth spurt in the income levels of lower middle-class families and working-class families. In the last two years, we have seen a rise in minimum salaries from $300 to $800. A minimum base salary of $800 for an unskilled Omani worker boosts trade hugely in the retail industry. Another factor in the evolution of the business environment over the past decade has been the consistent investment in education, health, and infrastructure development. These are the key elements in ensuring the success of any economy. We have seen very sizable growth despite the global downturn, which had little or no impact on Oman. Given the high levels of spending we have witnessed recently, there has been a certain amount of inflation, but this has been reasonable and controlled.</p><h4>What is your retail presence in Oman?</h4><p>We have close to 55 retail consumer grocery stores, including forecourt stores at fuel stations. We also have many luxury retail outlets, but we are more focused toward consumer retail and consumer grocery retail. This is a growth area for us, and we are actively evolving our offering. Our friendly neighborhood stores have done well, and we have made good penetration in the smaller towns of Oman. We are not focusing on the urban sprawls, but the smaller towns around Oman. We want to be the local neighborhood store.</p><h4>How is the logistics side of the business developing?</h4><p>We have grown the logistics, but now we really need to consolidate it because if the growth network and infrastructure in Oman is going to be shifting out of Muscat and into the south, then we will have to re-orientate our provision substantially toward the southern region. We are building large, fully integrated warehousing units. One building in particular will be the largest single warehouse in Oman at about 27,000 sqm in size. It is in Barka, about three kilometers beyond the airport. That is where the logistics hub will be in the next three to five years' time.</p><h4>How important is your brand portfolio?</h4><p>Most of our brands, including Rolex, Swarovski, and Pizza Hut, have been with us for over 20 years so we understand their philosophy in terms of marketing reach and they understand our ability and our distribution network. It is a win-win situation when we partner with such large brands. It is the distribution within Oman that is important. The volume isn't there; we are not as big as Saudi Arabia, and we are not as big as some North African countries, but we are certainly doing well for ourselves. They know that we are reliable and we do our job diligently. This has been an area of consistent success over the years. I am sure that each of our profit center managers will be looking at expansion, both organic and through new business ventures and joint ventures.</p><h4>How important is training and education?</h4><p>We do not view education as a means of earning profits. We use education as part of corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts and as a message that we need trained, skilled people. When we hire people, we need to train them according to our requirements given the absence of sufficient academies for skilled development. By setting up our academies we not only train our own future employees, but those of the nation. We have made a major contribution to setting up Muscat University, which is going to be established by the business people of Muscat. This will be a university for innovation and quality education. We wanted to set up a pure business school and did this alongside Symbiosis University, from India. We are a business family and feel we must give something back to society.</p><h4>What Omanization initiatives do you promote?</h4><p>We have taken a very pro-active role in the Omanization scheme. We are consciously aware of the fact that we need to employ local people and get them to really start working and appreciating what work culture is all about. We try to take on young people and retired young officers from the services and induct them into our system. We have done well. We have grown from having 300 plus Omani staff three years ago to about 2,000 now. We have about 4,000 employees in total.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How is the Port of Duqm Company (PDC) structured?<br></h4><p>For the Port of Duqm, as with most of the big projects in Oman, the government decided to team up with an established player in the industry with a proven track record. A similar approach was made for the Port of Sohar, for which the Port of Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, was selected and for the Port of Salalah, APMT, with its HQ in the Netherlands, is participating. The Port of Antwerp, in Belgium, was invited by the Omani government to participate in the management of the Port of Duqm. Duqm has the additional advantage of being a special economic zone (SEZ), with its own independent body called the Special Economic Zone Authority of Duqm (SEZAD). This Authority regulates the complete economic zone of Duqm and acts independently in issuing commercial and environmental permits. SEZAD communicates directly with the concerned ministries in Muscat and acts as a single window for its internal stakeholders. It creates a more direct problem-solving mechanism, which is favorable for business. There are, of course, other attractive aspects to the zone, as there are unique regulations regarding imports and exports, and it is possible to do business here as a 100% foreign-owned company. The umbrella of SEZAD covers all projects in the area, and the Port of Duqm is a key project in this economic zone next to the industrial zone, airport, and tourism development projects. Today, a lot of our efforts go toward assisting the design, where we cooperate with the design team and contractors appointed by the involved ministry. We strive for the most up-to-date technology and design for the port.</p><h4>How important is it that the Duqm project was started from scratch?</h4><p>I think it is a key aspect for future success. From the start you can put the right direction forward. For example, the marine works have been designed and executed to accommodate the largest vessels up to a draft of 18 meters. Also, both dry docks are some of the biggest in the region and are more than 400 meters long. The total port boundary is 170 square kilometers and the area for logistics covers 1,550 hectares. Each time we make a decision we have to keep one eye on the requirements of the future. We want to make the port as modern as possible, and the fact that we started from scratch has allowed us to anticipate future needs. Because of this, the long lifespan of our port will be guaranteed.</p><h4>When do you expect the port to be running at full capacity?</h4><p>A port is never finished. If you look at the Port of Antwerp, it has been developing for 500 years, dock-by-dock, step-by-step. It is still growing and upgrading its infrastructure for present and future requirements. Out of the first package, the marine works that include both breakwaters, dredging the approach channel, the first port basin, and the construction of the commercial quay walls have been finished. Parallel to these works, both dry docks have been built and are now operated by the Oman Drydock Company (ODC). The roads of this first package are now being constructed. The packages that take care of the pavement on the commercial quay wall, the technical buildings, and the entrance gate complex with its fencing are now under design. Once they are constructed, the commercial quay, which is 2.4-kilometers long, will accommodate a general cargo terminal, two container terminals, and one dry-bulk terminal. The construction should be finished in 2016. To accommodate the in- and out-flows of the refinery coming to Duqm, the development of liquids jetties, which will be on the other side of the port, has to be carried out. This package has to come into operation by 2017. As you see, it will be a never-ending story.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<title><![CDATA[The Main Ingredient]]></title>
		<url><![CDATA[the-main-ingredient]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have you been affected in recent years by demand in Oman for construction materials?<br></h4><p>Geologically, the Sultanate of Oman has a large, advantageous reserve of limestone, which is the main ingredient and raw material in the process of cement manufacturing. The Muscat area is surrounded by mountains and rocks with different types of minerals, especially limestone. Our plant is surrounded mainly by limestone, but also by the other necessary raw materials and additives required for cement production, such as iron, silica, kaolin, and gypsum. These raw materials are all available in Oman, and more than 95% of them are found in this area. This is the main reason why the government decided to construct the cement plant here. Though this area is a little far away from the capital, it will be connected to the city by easily accessible highways. Another advantage is the uninterrupted supply of natural gas from the Ministry of Oil and Gas required for the operation of the plant. This was a very important factor for us when we decided to double the capacity of the plant during 1998 and then again in 2011. The company's total capacity is now 8,000 tons, and there is strong demand in Oman for cement. There are also other manufacturers in the Sultanate like Raysut Cement Company and Al Madina Cement. Raysut Cement Company is larger than Oman Cement Company now after acquiring a cement plant in the UAE. Still, the demand remains larger than the total production of all manufacturers combined, and, therefore, we continue to import cement/clinker from neighboring countries in order to meet local demand. We are working with Raysut Cement Company to develop marketing strategies in other regions of the country. We are also in the process of establishing a new cement factory in the Duqm area in association with Raysut Cement Company, expecting the availability of natural gas by 2017. Also, a consultant has been appointed for a pre-feasibility study for this project.</p><h4>What is your market share within Oman?</h4><p>We occupy around one-third of the market. In export terms, we only export oil well cement, which is the kind used for drilling oil wells. Other than this, our major market is Muscat and its neighboring wilayats. The largest demand in the Sultanate is for ordinary Portland cement. About 20% of the demand is for sulfate-resistant cement, which is usually used for grounding and designed to counter sulfates seeping up from the soil. Another 10% of the demand is for oil well cement, which is being sold both locally and internationally.</p><h4>Do you see infrastructure and real estate development continuing to drive the high demand for Oman Cement in the future?</h4><p>We don't see many ups and downs in Oman and there is steady growth in the construction sector, as well as in the private sector. There is a proposed project for a railway network in the Sultanate, and that will necessitate a large quantity of cement for concrete. Hence, the demand will further increase to the point where we're going to need a new production line in Oman. It is a big country with rough terrain that will require a lot of bridges since railways lines cannot be laid through valleys. Because of this, we believe it's the right time to build an additional cement plant to meet local demand. We're also considering modifying our old plants and increasing the existing capacity. As for the location, we believe that any new plant should have a port base, so that we can easily export any surplus, if available. This is where Duqm comes in, and the good thing about Duqm is the availability of limestone reserves just 25-30 kilometers away from the port. Therefore, the plant can be built anywhere between the port and the reserve area, making it easy and inexpensive for raw material transport.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has A'Saffa Foods grown and developed since it was established in 2001?<br></h4><p>Originally, we focused on developing agribusiness through poultry farming. A'Saffa Foods was a pioneer in developing an integrated farm in the south of Oman to produce high-quality chicken to compete with imported products. A'Saffa Foods focuses on working together with other businesses, private as well as public, to develop food security-related projects within an investment framework that makes good returns. We have the support of an excellent pool of investors who come from various backgrounds in the region. The Gulf Investment Corporation (GIC) is one of the major entities in developing and helping A'Saffa Foods grow. The Arab Authority for Agriculture Investment and Development (AAAID) is also one of the key founders of A'Saffa Foods. Those kinds of corporates have insight that can help and promote A'Saffa Foods to grow and diversify. A'Saffa Foods, with its promoters' willingness to invest in Oman's agribusiness and support from the Omani government, is making its way to become a leader of food production in the country.</p><h4>How self-sufficient is the A'Saffa Foods farm in southern Oman?</h4><p>Our farm is fully integrated, which means it has the facilities to cover everything from feed processing and production, a parent farm and hatchery facility, to a slaughterhouse, frozen stores, and a managed fleet for transporting the finished goods to markets and distribution centers. A'Saffa Foods has whatever is needed to raise the 20 million chickens per year that are produced locally on the farm. This means that the company imports raw material for feed, manufactures it, and processes it there. The raw material comes from across the globe. Some of it is from Oman, such as fish feed. The safest source of protein feed for chickens is fish and soybean, as both are from different sources and are rich in nutrients. The farm management is very careful about what they feed these chickens. This is what we call naturally grown because we source it from the best source of proteins and using the best international practices.</p><h4>What does A'Saffa Foods produce besides poultry products?</h4><p>A'Saffa Foods has revisited its commercial identity to become a fully fledged food production company. Today, we have re-branded the company and the corporate image, meaning A'Saffa is now A'Saffa Foods. Very soon, A'Saffa will launch a food processing and production facility in the north of Oman, in Rusail, to focus on value-added products instead of A'Saffa Poultry, which will cater to regional as well as local markets. Poultry is still a major output of the company. A'Saffa has more than 35 products on the market from different types of poultry-based products, to beef, fish, vegetables, and fruits, and the list is growing.</p><h4>How are evolving consumer tastes driving change in the food production and retail sectors in Oman?</h4><p>Today, we are looking at the global consumer base, which is becoming increasingly homogeneous. The youth in North America, China, and the GCC region are becoming a global consumer of technology as well as food. You will see them with the same gadgets, the same sandwiches, and the same consumer behavior. This consumer behavior is changing very fast in Oman, and it seems that more convenient food is needed in the market. Precooked meals are the way forward; convenience is the way forward. Once you understand the complexity of consumer trends and the changes and evolution of this behavior, I think those who focus more on understanding and analyzing consumer behavior will lead the market.</p><h4>What does A'Saffa Foods do to promote healthy living, given the high occurrence of diabetes and lifestyle diseases in Oman?</h4><p>This is one of our main concerns, and A'Saffa Foods focuses on awareness. We work closely with NGOs as well as awareness groups to focus on quality foods and provide more data and information at the ingredient level to make sure that there is awareness for people who have allergies. A'Saffa Foods should focus more on naturally grown food as well as quality, halal, and health issues. This is a must for those who produce food in Oman.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role has the Ministry of Health (MOH) played in the development of healthcare provision in Oman?<br></h4><p>Prior to the 1970s, Oman's health services were extremely inadequate. From the beginning, the government made a commitment to develop a modern welfare state, including the promotion of health among Omani people. Oman's current health indicators compare well with those of many developed countries. Thanks to considerable economic and social development and progress in healthcare over the years, the Sultanate has achieved a life expectancy of over 76 years. This has been achieved despite a relatively high fertility rate and the consequent large share of the population under 15 years of age (34%). The health indicators show a remarkable reduction in mortality, especially childhood mortality. Remarkable achievements have been made in controlling other communicable diseases such as respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis, and leprosy. Control of malaria, once a deadly disease in Oman, has been a great success. The annual number of cases declined from over 30,000 in the early 1990s to only 1,531 cases in 2012. Almost all cases reported in the last decade were imported. The MOH is the country's main agency responsible for the health sector. It develops policies and plans and implements these in coordination with all constituents of the health sector. The public sector runs 83% of the hospitals and 92.5% of hospital beds, and employs most doctors and nurses. The MOH runs about 75% of the hospitals and 78% of hospital beds, with about 70% of doctors and 77% of nurses. The MOH is also the principal provider of preventive, promotion, and rehabilitative services. It provides ambulance facilities and emergency medicine services. Drug control, bulk procurement, and the distribution of drugs are managed by the MOH. It runs educational institutions for nurses and allied professionals, and collaborates with Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) and the Oman Medical Specialty Board (OMSB) for undergraduate and post-graduate medical education.</p><h4>How is the Ministry dealing with the challenges associated with a rising population?</h4><p>Oman spends 2.4% of GDP on health. That is considered high compared to the average of 0.5% for developed countries and 1.6% for less developed countries. It is also high compared to the rates in a number of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Considering the country's limited resources, the consequences of population growth will certainly affect the governments' policies for economic and social development. It is noteworthy that successive years of relatively rapid population growth have given Oman an overwhelmingly young demographic profile. Governmental spending on health accounts for about 82.5% of total health expenditure. In 1976, Oman devoted OMR9 million to the health sector. By 2012, the budget of the MOH had only grown to OMR482 million. Estimates show that by the year 2025, the MOH alone would require almost double its current spending on health to ensure the maintenance of sustainable national health development, a situation that would be far beyond the capacity of public financing.</p><h4>What is the role of the private sector?</h4><p>Although Oman has a very good public healthcare system and the services are free to nationals, the private sector has survived and even grown over the past decades. The private sector healthcare providers currently deliver both primary healthcare and specialized medical services through clinics, medical centers, polyclinics, or hospitals. Also, the private sector plays a major role in the pharmaceuticals sector and in providing dentistry services. The numbers of private hospitals and clinics are now 11 and 973, respectively. The number of hospital beds has increased to 488 in 2012 from just six in 1995. The number of private pharmacies has also grown over the same period from 254 to 476. Indeed, the private healthcare sector is complementing public healthcare reasonably well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the University of Nizwa evolved and developed over the years?</h4><p>In 1999, his Majesty gave the green light for the private sector in Oman to participate in higher education. The government at that time gave initial permits for four regional universities, and one of them was the University of Nizwa. We worked as a group of academics, highly trained in various fields, from different parts of the world, with a group of academics from around the globe to develop the concept of the University of Nizwa. The idea was to develop a university as a non-profit organization serving society that could cater for high-quality higher education services for Omanis at the lowest cost possible. Toward that vision and mission, the whole project evolved and, since then, we have moved from concept to reality. Now, we have around 6,500 students, and around 99% are Omanis. International student numbers are slightly growing; we have about 70 students from 15 countries. We also try to globalize our students by receiving exchange students. This summer we received exchange students from about 15 countries. We also take our students to the UK, the US, France, Germany, and Malaysia. We are expanding the global horizon so students can go for about eight weeks in the summer and take some courses while they are exposed to a different culture. We have four colleges: Arts and Sciences; Engineering and Architecture; Economics, Management, and Information Systems; and Pharmacy and Nursing. We offer about 43 degree programs at the national level and we currently have seven Master's programs.</p><h4>What is the balance between Master's and Bachelor level students?</h4><p>The majority of students are undergraduates; the Master's programs have just started in the last three years. They are really attracting a good number of students. We have some Master's degrees offered and taught in the Arabic language, such as a Master of Education in counseling and guidance, and one in learning administration. The majority of our courses are taught in English. We also have French and German language classes that we offer at the undergraduate level.</p><h4>How much training do you have to provide to get students up to a sufficient level of English?</h4><p>One of the challenges in the services is that we have a general foundation program here to bridge the gap between the high school 12th grade and higher education. That is really taking a lot of effort because the graduates might have minimal English, and we have to upgrade them to the level of higher education, around 500-600 in TOEFL. That is really challenging for so many of the students. Many of them require at least a year and a half to get to that level. There is a lot of motivation and encouragement from outside. We normally hire native speakers for our general foundation program from the UK, US, Canada, Australia, and South Africa. For the academic programs, our faculty is very international. We have 45 countries represented. The Omanis are really growing, but we have to work as a nation and as a university in that line. Currently, about 18%-20% of our faculty is Omani. Our administrative and technical staff are 85% Omani.</p><div class="quote">“  The majority of our courses are taught in English. We also have French and German language classes. "</div><h4>Which are the most popular courses and programs for the university?</h4><p>The most popular are really those that are required in the market: Pharmacy, Nursing, Engineering, Information Systems, and English. We tried our best to plan these degree programs so the graduates can meet society's needs and find employment. With the job market changing all the time, we have to try to create a curriculum that is dynamic rather than fixed because, by the time the graduates leave university, the market might have changed.</p><h4>How would you assess the academic standard in Omanis?</h4><p>That is one of the challenges, especially in math and science. There is some weakness in developing school students with critical thinking, analytical skills, and liberal art skills. It is part of our duty to equip the students with the necessary skills. That takes a long time and a lot of effort. The university really invested in that regard. For example, we have created several self-learning services, like the Writing Center. That will help students throughout their years at university to improve their writing skills in English, Arabic, and other languages. It is very useful and many students are attending. Also, we created many labs so that students can improve their English skills at their own pace. We have one other center, the Learning Enhancement Center, which helps students who are weak in math, physics, or economics, for example. They can go there and get help for basic classes from tutors who are their peers.</p><h4>Is the university also trying to establish work core values?</h4><p>Yes, that is one of the required skills and modes of behavior. Within each degree, we have instituted internship programs, research projects, and other things intended to help the students master and practice some of these skills. We need to cover all the fields. We need to develop that further to ensure better market skills. That will really require a lot of help from society as a whole. The private sector and the government need to cooperate in that field so that access to the training side can be facilitated. The government also needs to see the value of that because these graduates are the future employees of the country and they need practice before they join the workforce. We have some collaboration with the private sector, but it is on a one-to-one basis. We have tried to sign memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with some institutions to do that, but I feel we need a national decree to speed that up and facilitate it.</p><h4>How do you feel about the efforts the government has made to promote universities and colleges?</h4><p>I feel the government has done a lot in the last few years to promote private-sector participation in higher education. Sometimes, I think officials overdid it because the number of institutions that have been granted permits to participate is beyond the capacity of the nation. We will have a shortage of students in the future if they continue along that line. The other issue is in terms of government institutions; they are so dispersed, and they should be restructured. There is an effort to do that and we hope it will materialize soon to minimize this imbalance.</p><h4>What is your vision for the University of Nizwa in the next five years?</h4><p>We are working very hard to develop our main campus. We are accommodating a very functional campus, and we are also building our new campus within two years to complement it. We are also enhancing research. In the last three years, we started to accelerate our research activities. We have some funds for certain projects. In that regard, we have created two research chairs; one is in collaboration with the University of Cambridge, and the other is our own for Omani medicinal plants. We've published many papers and done a lot of clinical analysis. Part of our activities in the coming few years will also be to attract international students. We are working on the second cycles of academic accreditation and we are working to get our University to a world-class status. It will take a while; naturally, we are growing from scratch.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has International Marble Company (IMC) developed since 1999?</h4><p>We started mining marble in 1999 after a survey of the mineral reserves and geography of Oman was carried out by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Once we realized that there was marble in Oman, we began operations. Today, we are the largest marble processors in the world offering brands such as Desert Rose, Desert Beige, and Desert Oasis. Our daily production is 14,000 sqm of marble, and we have completed many projects locally and internationally. We have supplied approximately 700,000 sqm of marble for projects in Oman, the largest of which was the Muscat Royal Guest Palace (Qasr Al Alam Al Amer). The Palace required marble 7.5 centimeters thick. We also provided materials for the Royal Opera House, which required approximately 100,000 sqm of marble. We are currently exporting our materials to 52 countries through our network of agents worldwide.</p><h4>What have been your most successful projects?</h4><p>The largest project we have undertaken was in Dubai for the Palm Jumeirah. The work included 700,000 sqm of marble and took around 18 months. In China, we carried out a project of around 300,000 sqm, which was not easy. This is the advantage of IMC versus other companies throughout the world for the fulfillment of marble for huge projects. We have one quarry, and from that one location we can deliver all of the materials according to approved samples. Most of the other companies have more than one quarry, which makes them difficult to supply materials in huge quantities.</p><div class="quote">“We have supplied approximately 700,000 sqm of marble for projects in Oman, the largest of which was the Muscat Royal Guest Palace."</div><h4>What quantity of reserves do you estimate remain in the quarry?</h4><p>The study from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which was carried out by a consultant company, put the depth of the quarry at 30 meters. Today, we have already gone down to more than 200 meters, and we still have approximately 200 meters left before we reach the end of the reserves. We expect that we have enough marble to last the company for 20 years. We are also looking for more mines, which we predict could be located near Ibri. We have already begun work on a new quarry about 10 kilometers from our current work site.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to expand your capacity?</h4><p>IMC reached its current capacity in 2012. We have entered the second phase of our factory. Although the factory is huge and we are using only about 30% of its full capacity, we feel that we can increase our production. We have plenty of material to work with in the quarry, but for now, 14,000 sqm daily is enough for IMC. Economically speaking, the requirements of the global market are our main priority. If need be, our factories can cater to the needs the international market demands.</p><h4>How do you remain ahead of the international competition in the marble mining industry?</h4><p>Competition is fierce in this market, especially from countries that have similar materials, such as Turkey, Iran, and Egypt. Italy and Spain also have a wealth of mineral resources, but the costs in Europe are high, and we face very little competition from companies in that part of the world. However, competition with low-cost countries remains a factor. A second factor is that in Oman we are not allowed to export blocks. We have to do the processing here, and that adds value to the country. We add value in the processing, not in the quarry. This is thanks to an excellent decision made by the government.</p><h4>What sets IMC apart in the marble market?</h4><p>IMC is a specialist for large projects. Other companies struggle to supply the quantities we can, especially if there is limited time. For us, time is not important, and for this reason we are getting many projects at once: we have concurrent initiatives in South America, the Far East, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China, and India. In a limited amount of time, we can fulfill the requirements of several large projects, and that is an advantage for us. Saudi Arabia is the largest growth market, in addition to China and India. On the whole, the GCC is the number one market for us. We are not considering opening any mines internationally, but we will always remain open to possibilities.</p><h4>How are logistics organized for the export of marble?</h4><p>We ship full containers to different ports worldwide from Oman. Trailer trucks owned by us transport the marble containers to the ports. The government has plans to close the Port of Muscat and use Sohar exclusively. This will not affect us because we use Sohar's port already, and it is not far from our factory. We are ready also to shift to Sohar and work from there. However, for local shipments in Oman, we use our own trailers.</p><h4>What is your environmental policy?</h4><p>Oman has strict environmental policies, and for this reason we also have ISO 14001 certification for our protection of the environment. We are the only marble company in the GCC that was awarded the ISO 14001 with the scope of the mining, processing, and supply of natural marble. Therefore, we are very dedicated to conserving the environment. IMC also received the ISO 9001 certificate for its Quality Management System.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the marble mining industry in Oman?</h4><p>The industry has already expanded to reach most of the country. There is a future for this business, but it does need more attention from the government. A number of countries have gotten involved in materials production, and many have made mistakes; we are working to ensure that we don't suffer the same fate. First, exporting blocks is a mistake made by many countries. Second, opening more quarries and launching competition among companies to drive prices down leaves no export benefits. In some countries, competition between local companies reached a level where if they were not selling at an extremely low price, then they had to close their factories.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of IMC?</h4><p>Considering our growth from 1999 until today, we have been moving along smoothly and sustainably. We have done a lot of work to reach this level, and it all began in 1999. Today, we are the largest marble processor in the world. IMC is engaged in many projects and the company doesn't depend on local demand. Of our production, around 10% is allocated to the local market, and around 90% is exported. In 2012, we reached a daily production figure of 14,000 sqm, which we are currently satisfied with. However, we want to take steps forward and bring our activity up to the next level, which depends on demand from the international market.</p><p>© The Business Year - February 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the role of technology and science in education?<br></h4><p>We are investing heavily in our ICT capacity. For example, we are building a nationwide fiber-optic network. We also want to channel this project into e-government, making it easier for people to access government services remotely. If we succeed in this it would also contribute significantly to the reduction of irregularities that currently blight the system. This administration is dedicated to the proliferation of e-education for the future of the nation. There is a vast amount of knowledge available on the internet and we want our schoolchildren in small schools and villages across Tanzania to access it. We want all schools to be connected to the network, which would go a long way toward addressing the problem of teacher shortages as lessons could in part be widely broadcast simultaneously.</p><p>E-medicine, e-commerce, and e-tourism are other areas of interest to us. Tanzania should reach a point where someone coming from San Francisco and staying here can simply swipe a card and pay for the entire trip without resorting to cash. This is one of the programs we have developed in collaboration with Microsoft. And once again, for such programs to become a reality, a fiber-optic network is essential. For all our previous projects, we have been dependent on expensive satellite links. Now, however, with optic-fiber and submarine cables, we believe Tanzania is creating the right infrastructure to encourage science and ICT. School curricula, meanwhile, are preparing students today to enter the information industry tomorrow.</p><h4>What policy decisions have contributed to making Tanzania such an attractive destination for FDI?</h4><p>We effectively pursue all diplomatic channels in the interest of advancing our technological capabilities. For example, India has donated a super computer on which scientific research is pursued in some interesting areas. In regard to e-medicine, which we are working toward, we were able to see its potential in terms of dispensaries, hospital work, and data gathering for national hospitals. My reaching out to Bill Gates at Microsoft also led to support for our schools, and this was also the case with IBM, which has contributed to ICT education at local schools. I have visited the laboratories of Google and Stanford University, where I heard interest in working with Tanzania. When it comes to investment, it is a question of putting the right policies in place and ensuring that the climate is attractive for the private sector. We see a great deal of interest in Tanzania's resources, especially in regard to natural gas exploration. We have made a number of amendments to our investment environment to facilitate commitment. The country's geography itself is a resource, offering access to a huge market.</p><div class="quote">“  We effectively pursue all diplomatic channels in the interest of advancing our technological capabilities. "</div><h4>How will Big Results Now help the country achieve its Tanzania Development (Vision 2025) goal of becoming a middle-income country?</h4><p>Strategic planning has been the touchstone since independence. We set out with five three-year development plans, although the oil shock, war with Uganda, and historical droughts negatively impacted the implementation of the second five-year plan, almost discontinuing the five-year plan system altogether. Then in 2000, we developed a long-term perspective embodied in Vision 2025, whereby Tanzania aims to become a middle-income nation. When I assumed my current position in 2005, we declared the Vision, but still lacked a plan. Recently, I returned to the 15-year development plan. We are currently formulating the first three-year development plan, and in 2025 we will emerge as a middle-income country. Breaking it down even further, we also draft annual plans. Within those, we see strategic areas of investment and focus. In the cabinet, we decided to agree on the key six sectors that needed our focus. These were infrastructure, energy, water, education, agriculture, and tourism. Health was to be included in due course. Appropriate budgeting for each has been a challenge and some allocations remain to be made. I believe that it is imperative for all ministries to deliver on their allocated targets for a uniform advancement of the economy, and in its wake the country itself. The government has made promises to the people, and we deliver on them.</p><h4><br>What is your personal vision for the country over the next decade?</h4><p>I'm very optimistic that by 2025, Tanzania will have emerged as a middle-income country. It's a tall order in the sense that by that time, the population will have reached 65 million. We also have to post a GDP of close to $200 billion. Gas-related revenues will clearly expedite the process. However, we first have to regulate the sector properly, allocate revenues judiciously, and ensure overall national development. We are working hard in collaboration with the US, the UK, and the World Bank to avoid catching the proverbial “Dutch disease" in the process. These entities and a variety of others are helping regulate the sector and build systems that ensure effective national growth.</p><h4>How can Tanzania inspire its neighbors to increase regional prosperity and stability?</h4><p>We have been making contributions to regional peace. However, “charity begins at home," as they say. And so while working aboard, we have been concentrating on peace and stability on the home front through the rule of law, and bolstering of human rights, the democratic principle. We believe that the policies pursued by the founding fathers and successive generations have laid the foundations for a sustainable and peaceful nation. We have also registered progress across many areas thanks to the dynamism, open-mindedness, and receptiveness to change of the Tanzanian people. In 2014, we are going to celebrate 50 years of the union, and although we have experienced challenges, on the whole we have succeeded. And in celebrating 50 years, I have suggested that we review our constitution for potential amendment in step with national advancement. The commission tasked with this has provoked much debate and we are confident of its findings. At the political level, there is an inherent dynamism on the part of the ruling party, which has a readiness to effect the necessary changes. This has supported the stability of the country and is also a catalyst for positive change to come.</p><h4>What role will science and technology play in the national Vision 2025?</h4><p>It is my firm belief that science and technology will carry Tanzania toward its status as a middle-income country by 2025. If we can anchor these two critical components properly, we can, for example, maximize the productivity of our agriculture sector. We also have the natural resources and human capital to benefit from science. This should result in a higher growth economy, with a more developed market, and substantially increased income of the Tanzanian people.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role does the e-Government Agency play in Tanzania?<br></h4><p>The e-Government Agency (eGA) is a semi-autonomous institution established under the President Office's of Public Services Management. It effectively became operational on April 1, 2012 with the mandate for the coordination, oversight, and provision of e-government initiatives and the enforcement of e-government standards for public institutions. We are there to ensure that the use of ICT enhances the delivery of public services in terms of improving service quality, broadening service availability, and innovating new types of services. We want to see the improved efficiency of government business processes that will enhance public service delivery. Ours is a newly established agency and I am its first CEO; I assumed the role in 2012. My first real task was to develop a strategic plan, within which we have six areas of attention. The first involves enhancing the capacity of public institutions to implement e-government initiatives wherein we are going to play a central role. We have to improve the capacity of ICT management within those departments, such that they can effectively manage, control and maintain ICT in their domains. We also want to facilitate efficient management of ICT within the government to foster a good relationship between the agency and other government departments. The second area concerns the improvement of public access to e-services. The opportunity of extending public services electronically and in particular by mobile phone will be achieved following the electronic enhancement of government business processes. We have placed a special focus on the mobile phone because the majority of Tanzanians don't have computers and live in rural areas. However, more than 26 million people now have access to mobile phones, and we think we can start with very basic public services in this manner. For example, if you go to a rural medicine dispensary and happen to receive poor services, then it should be possible for you to lodge a complaint—even from your mobile. As a citizen, you should be able to inform the government of the availability of medicine, problems related to education, water availability, and other services from your mobile phone. Integrity is our number one core value and innovation is the second. We want to be innovative such that we can make use of technology to extend services to citizens. We also want to make information on public services and possible online services available. We want to deliver basic information by text, which is made possible by mobile phones. The other area is the management of shared resources. When I began my tenure, there had been many silo-based initiatives; we had islands of information systems, but the systems did not talk to each other and there were many idle resources. We want to harmonize all of the systems and make them share the available resources wherever possible. Someone may have a mini-data center or a large server room, but they only use 1% of the capacity; within five years, most of the systems and hardware have reached the end of their lifespans and need replacement.</p><h4>How receptive are the government agencies to your goals?</h4><p>Most of the public institutions have accepted eGA's goals positively, because these goals aim to provide services to public institutions by harmonizing shared public infrastructure, developing applications, implementing frameworks, and providing consultancy, advice, and technical support. We believe that through the enforcement of government ICT initiatives, public institutions will be able to increase their capacity to provide services to citizens (G2C), business communities (G2B), and employees (G2E), effectively. The institutions believe that eGA is there to solve e-government related problems, thereby saving government cost and time.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Heikki Eidsvoll Holmí¥s, Minister of International Development for Norway, on the development of relations between the two countries and the achievements of Tanzania since independence.</h4><p>Tanzania's vision is to become a middle-income country and reduce its aid dependence significantly by 2025. Until recently, few economists considered this possible. But that was before oil companies found large quantities of gas off the coast of the country. Today, Tanzania looks set to become a gas economy. And while gas revenues will not immediately be generated, Tanzania's prospects of a future without aid are now brighter. Norway will support Tanzania in its efforts to reach this goal, and make sure that the income from the natural resources benefits all people of Tanzania.</p><p>It is likely that gas alone will lead to a doubling or even tripling of foreign investment in Tanzania over the next five to 10 years. Once gas production is fully developed, depending on gas prices and production costs, tax revenues could be two to four times higher than total development assistance to the country. But let us not forget that Tanzania remains a poor country. More than seven out of 10 people live below the poverty line of $1.25 per day.</p><p>Norway and Tanzania have enjoyed close relations ever since Tanzania gained independence. Relations have been built at all levels, from the level of the respective heads of state—the King of Norway and the President of the United Republic of Tanzania—to the thousands of individuals from both countries with a unique story to tell.</p><div class="quote">“  Tanzania has been a haven of peace, and has supported its neighboring countries during their struggles for independence. "</div><p>Despite ups and downs, Tanzania has achieved much since independence, socially and economically: life expectancy has risen from 43 to 58 years; people earn twice as much (enhancing purchasing power); at the time of independence, eight out of 10 people were illiterate. Today, those numbers have reveresed; at the time of independence, only six out of 20 children attended primary school. Today, 19 out of 20 children do so; the infant mortality rate has been reduced by about 70%; tax revenues have increased from about 11% to 18% of GDP over the past 10 years; and economic growth has remained at 6%-7% over the past decade, despite the global financial crisis.</p><p>Recent developments indicate that our partnership is set to change more rapidly over the coming years. This good news confirms that Tanzania is among the five fastest-growing economies in the world. High rates of economic growth, combined with systematic government efforts to increase domestic revenues, have enabled Tanzania to reduce its dependency on foreign aid, whereby the share of the state budget funded by aid has been halved over the past five years. Similarly, levels of investment, both foreign and national, have increased, reflecting the economic opportunities in Tanzania.</p><p>For many years, Tanzania has been a haven of peace, and has supported its neighboring countries during their struggles for independence. The founding father and first President of the Republic Mwalimu Julius Kambarage Nyerere and his successors embarked with great vigor and resolve on a process of nation building and reconciliation that has few parallels in Africa. The social cohesion that resulted is still apparent in Tanzania today. Any asset, however, must be protected, and at times reviewed in order to endure. This is a challenge we all face. In today's Tanzania, harmony is jeopardized by growing economic disparities, greater religious tension, and issues of ethnicity in politics. Combating poverty is still of fundamental importance to ensure continued stability and peace.</p><p>Several major Norwegian companies have seen the opportunities available in the continent, and have established a presence in Tanzania. Many more companies, primarily in the petroleum, energy, agriculture, and tourism sectors, are about to follow suit. Statoil, Norway's national oil company has made major discoveries of commercially viable gas reserves off Tanzania's shores. Many Norwegian companies are expected to make strategic investments in various sectors in Tanzania in the future, to include the new gas economy.</p><p>Norway will continue to cooperate with Tanzania over the coming years and help enhance domestic revenue mobilization through the sound management of renewable and non-renewable resources. We will also provide support in addressing the challenges Tanzania faces in safeguarding global common goods and services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Tanzania hosted the Global 2013 Smart Partnership Dialogue, and over the past decade the Smart Partnership concept has become something of a brand. How did this concept come about?<br></h4><p>We have a history of direct involvement in different African countries. Uganda has hosted the Smart Partnership Dialogue twice, and other countries that have done so besides Tanzania are Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Lesotho, Swaziland, and Zambia. The whole thing began in 1995. As Science Adviser of the Malaysian Prime Ministry, my job was to develop a better management system for science and technology, enabling the country to be more focused on enhancing the economy. I enjoyed being a prime mover in the development of science, technology, and innovation in Malaysia. Then, two years into my work, the Commonwealth Science Council was my first window into an international network. In 1989, the Commonwealth of Nations met in Kuala Lumpur. They said to me, why doesn't Malaysia propose to transform the Scientific Management Organization (SMO) into a larger unit that Commonwealth countries could broadly use. Malaysia then submitted a proposal that resulted in the Commonwealth Consulting Group of Technology Management (CCGTM), to which I was appointed Chairman. This later became the Commonwealth Partnership for Technology Management. At that time, the Malaysian prime minister was promoting a development model that required collaboration between the public and private sectors. From that concept, the idea of the Smart Partnership arose. We held the first event in 1995 in Lankow, Malaysia. The Smart Partnership Dialogue is basically a platform for learning through sharing. For example, participating policymakers, such as the Tanzanian Commissioner for Science and Technology, learn about reorganization, or the introduction of new methods and systems into the organization. In short, what this does can be summed up as “You Share, You Learn, You Act."</p><h4>What are Tanzania's strengths and challenges as it looks to implement policy to promote science, technology, and innovation (STI)?</h4><p>Tanzania already has a number of structures in place, such as the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology (COSTECH). When the President realized the need to develop STI in Tanzania, he allocated heavily to R&amp;D. COSTECH operates under the Ministry of Science; however, it needs to consider whether this is the best arrangement, as a more senior figure might better drive the national STI agenda is not possible.</p><h4>What are the best ways to address Tanzania's human resources challenge?</h4><p>In my book, The Essentials of Science, Technology and Innovation Policy, is a short chapter called Holistic Human Capital Development. We know that the world has actor-driven, efficiency-driven, and innovation-driven economies, and the general desire is to create the latter of the three. The innovation-driven economy requires creative people able to challenge the status quo, and an education system that fosters such thinking. Therefore, in the Holistic Human Capital Development section I look at six key sub-capital types. One is intellectual capital. Then comes social capital, which includes social skills and language skills, for example. A fourth aspect is entrepreneurial capital. Not everybody can become an entrepreneur, but you must encourage those who might be immediately. Essential, too, is psychological capital, which is commitment, belief, and confidence in the task at hand. Lastly, you need ritual capital, including ethical values. If you want to create an innovation-driven economy, you have to look at ways to develop all of these, starting from the home itself, as well as in school, beginning with kindergarten and rising all the way to university, and on into the workplace.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What financial policies have made Tanzania's rapid growth possible and, going forward, how do you manage the risks of a fast-growing economy without jeopardizing its health?<br></h4><p>Tanzania is one of the fastest growing economies in Africa. We experienced very high average growth of 6.9% to 7% between 2000 and 2012. However, this has not served adequately in terms of reducing poverty. During the same period, poverty has declined at a rate of 2% to 3%. We have discovered that the fastest growing sectors like construction, transportation, and finance will not employ as many people as agriculture, which has been growing at an average of 4.3% for the past decade. The second issue to consider is political tranquility. Tanzania enjoys a climate of political stability, which has made it possible to plan our programs and implement them without interruption. Also, our economic program has been reinforced by strong monetary and fiscal policies. A third element is sound financial management, which we have also improved, and which has led to a concomitant improvement in the financial sector's performance. Studies have shown that where there is an improvement in the financial sector, there is a positive correlation with economic performance. We have experienced a rise in both the number of commercial and community banks, along with new financial institutions, such as the Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB). We are also in the process of opening the Tanzania Agricultural Development Bank (TADB). These are forecast to give the economy an opportunity to guide investment. Meanwhile, we have enjoyed a relatively positive performance in terms of social security funds, which have really contributed to the financing of other sectors, particularly on the investment side. All of these have contributed to the wellbeing of society. The final factor that has contributed to our success is our focus on investment; we have been doing our best to invest in strategic areas. Our task is to identify strategic projects that will support the development of other economic sectors. We emphasize energy generation and infrastructure, which involves seaports, airports, roads, and rail, including the modernization of all of these modes of transport. By focusing on these three factors, we can drive the economy forward. We have also invested a great deal in the provision of social services, particularly in water and road infrastructure, both of which add economic value through the integration of rural and urban communities. This has allowed us to drive the economy forward at a reasonable pace.</p><h4>As Tanzania is now one of the top three destinations in East Africa for foreign investment, will capital controls be reviewed?</h4><p>The future of investment in Tanzania is positive because of our clear investment policy. We are also looking at how to liberalize our capital account. We are still considering certain parameters, as we are not completely liberalized. In particular, we are looking at an optimal position that will enable us to attract more investment by redesigning policies geared toward improving the economy.</p><h4>Which of your policies could incentivize investment in Tanzania?</h4><p>We are looking to the recovery of gas reserves as one of the main drivers of the economy. Currently, we are spending almost $0.44 to generate 1 kWh of electricity. However, once we have the ability and the infrastructure required to deliver our gas reserves to users, we will be able to generate electricity at between $0.04 and $0.06 per kWh. This will enable us to reduce the cost of doing business in Tanzania, and is therefore a key consideration. The second factor is that by reducing utility costs incurred by industry employment can grow, thereby creating wealth for a broader swathe of the population. Therefore, these instruments will assist us in managing the economy properly by reducing the cost of doing business.</p><div class="quote">“  The future of investment in Tanzania is positive because of our clear investment policy. "</div><h4>Affordable credit is a major issue in Tanzania. How are you addressing the inability of most individuals and SMEs to obtain financing?</h4><p>The widening of the financial base can only take place if we first introduce a regulatory authority to safeguard service providers for the benefit of all parties. The second consideration is the setting aside of a sufficient budget to ensure that the nationwide personal identification scheme is completed no later than 2015, which we have done. This will provide an interface for the link between service providers and their beneficiaries, whereby a single identification list will be available to facilitate all processes in the country, including banking. In fact, the national identification system and the widening of the financial base go hand in hand. Licensing financial institutions can be quick, easy, and affordable, which means that the expansion of financial services takes place quickly in centers of high population.</p><h4>Where does international aid fit in with the new dynamic of rapid economic growth generating wealth in the country?</h4><p>We are making efforts to reduce our dependency on foreign aid, currently at a rate of 5.5% of GDP, to 5% for 2014. This will be a serious step toward improving and relying on our own resources. We will maintain a mixture of FDI or grants where we cannot manage alone. Yet both sources must be targeted at investment in economically crucial areas that offer greater opportunities for growth.</p><h4>Vision 2025 declares Tanzania's ambition of becoming a middle-income country. How do you plan to facilitate this?</h4><p>Firstly, the goals of Vision 2025 cannot be met without a realignment of the capacities of certain key sectors. The goal of the financial sector in a developed economy is to facilitate the funding of robust human capital and requisite technology through investment. By improving the role of the private sector and banking system, as well enhancing the public sector, public management, and accountability, we can build the instruments to create rapid economic growth and achieve the goals of 2025. Our manifesto and five-year development plan must reflect the spirit embodied by Vision 2025. In this manner we can realize all of the objectives that will transform Tanzania into a middle-income country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the best ways to facilitate and promote Tanzania as a destination for FDI?<br></h4><p>Stability in the economic and political sphere is absolutely critical, especially where investments are of a long-term nature. Predictability arises from economic and political stability, and Tanzania is very fortunate in this respect. We subscribe to a number of international arrangements and agreements that enable us to comply with standards that attract the right type of FDI, and we will continue to do this. Preferential treatment is important because it provides direct benefits downstream. However, our membership in international trading blocs, such as the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), is also important. This also contributes to making Tanzania a lucrative business address by creating trade and investment opportunities. We are also strategically located, and serve as a corridor to the inland regions, which will bode well in terms of maintaining our commercial competitiveness.</p><h4>What issues should investors be aware of when coming to Tanzania?</h4><p>I think it is important to familiarize yourself with the regulatory and legal framework of the country first. The relevant laws include the Investment Act 1997, the Mining Act 1998, the Export Processing Zones Act 2002, the Anti-dumping Act 2003, and the New Income Tax Act 2004. We are developing sector-specific guides, and have a section in our investment guide that explains everything of most importance that you need to know before arrival. One thing we find is that investors can struggle in terms of knowing which door to knock on first in order to kick-start their projects. Regardless of the nature and type of investment, TIC is always a preferred first point of call for investors, whom we gladly serve. We try to simplify information and make it available in the public domain for easy access. We encourage investors, and also have a hungry, burgeoning private sector that is willing to take risks. Our advice to foreign investors is to try to partner with the best local institutions to establish a footprint in the country and better understand the risks inherent in our system. They will know how to tackle them.</p><h4>What is the investment outlook for power generation in Tanzania?</h4><p>It is positive because there is a lack of generating capacity. Successful promotion of investment in Tanzania's power generation capacity has the potential to eliminate the current power shortage and reduce high costs incurred by industry and consumers. Over the long term, Tanzania has the potential to become a power exporter to the region. Tanzania has ample resources for power generation, but lacks the infrastructure necessary to harness them: hydro, gas, coal, oil and biofuels. A number of projects using these resources to solve short- and long-term needs have already been identified under the “Big Results Now" initiative. We have worked very closely with the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, to facilitate the arrival of private investment in the power sector. We are trying to clear the way for us to be able to take them through our legal processes and get the necessary incentives to enable them begin their operations. Another area of significant appetite is the development of fertilizers. There is huge demand from the market and our role as TIC is to fast track the process and work with the various government agencies to provide individuals access to feed stock, as well as land to set up their plants. A sense of urgency has been created, and with President Barack Obama's recent visit and his pledge for the “Power Africa" project, we retained that sense of urgency and perhaps created more. We are working hard to align ourselves, and are ready to support more investment in that area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY You define Tanzania's current foreign policy as “economic diplomacy." What does that mean, and how does it differ from Tanzania's traditional foreign policy?<br></h4><p>Our traditional foreign policy was centered on African unity, liberation, the promotion of neighborliness, regional integration, non-alignment, and adherence to the UN Charter. It took a long time for countries in Southern Africa, such as Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia, and South Africa, to gain their independence. And once Africa was fully liberated, we began thinking about what came next. We decided to direct our attention to economic development. We determined that one of our pillars of foreign policy would be economic diplomacy, which we defined as promoting investment, trade, and tourism. Moreover, we actively encourage investors in extractive industries, agriculture, and communication. We have encouraged our overseas embassies to identify investors who are interested in Tanzania, while also providing Tanzanians with economic opportunities in other countries based on the information that our diplomatic missions issue the business communities through the Tanzanian Investment Center, Chambers of Commerce, and the media. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has succeeded in doing this. It has created a boost in tourism as well as greater investment in agriculture, the extractive industries, manufacturing, telecommunications, and trade. Over the past decade, we have seen fantastic development.</p><h4>How would you define Tanzania's regional leadership credentials and the importance of regional integration?</h4><p>We feel very powerful in the region because of our strategic location and role in the liberation struggle. We are among the creators of the East African Community (EAC). We have reached the common market in the region and now have free movement of labor, capital, goods, and services, and capital, as well as common external tariffs. With regard to the South African Development Community (SADC) region, we have reached a free trade agreement (FTA) that allows the free movement of goods. This is a market of 500 million to 600 million people, and any commodity that Tanzania produces can find its market there. However, we believe we can do better. Tanzania is strategically located in the region thanks to its deep natural harbor and being surrounded by seven landlocked countries. We have the Port of Dar es Salaam and two railway lines running from Dar es Salaam to Zambia and Kigoma, which is a dream come true. Tanzania is both a member of the EAC and SADC, and we are comfortable in enjoying this double status. We cannot abandon one region in favor of another; we believe we can serve both. We are doing our best in terms of promoting trade and investment.</p><h4>One of your goals is to increase the number of Tanzanian embassies abroad. What impact will that have?</h4><p>It will have a huge impact. Today, we have 35 embassies, and our mission is to have at least 50 by 2020. Four or five years ago, we had no tourists coming from Turkey and no business investment from Turkey in Tanzania. However, as soon as we opened our honorary consulates in both Ankara and Istanbul, and once flights had begun between the two countries, we saw business beginning to flow. When an embassy or an honorary consulate is opened, you can see an immediate impact as business people and tourists begin to arrive in numbers. We are now planning to open embassies in Turkey, South Korea, the Comoros, and the Netherlands.</p><div class="quote">“  Today we have 35 embassies, and our mission is to have at least 50 by 2020. "</div><h4>Tanzania was one of three African countries Obama visited on his regional trip. Why do you feel he chose Tanzania, and what does this mean from a foreign policy perspective?</h4><p>Tanzania invests in people. We receive a lot of development assistance, including that of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) in the US. The funds that Tanzania receives are used efficiently and the results are tangible. It is certainly in the interest of the US to see how its tax-payer money is being used. It is very clear where the money that came from donors has been invested in people, infrastructure, health, and education. The people themselves will tell you that certain roads were built through MCC assistance. The US has spent millions on eradicating malaria in Tanzania, and when officials arrive they see how the public is protected against the disease-carrying mosquito—any head of state would be interested to see this. We are also a very stable nation—all neighboring countries have suffered civil wars, and despite the fact that we have 129 native tribes, we have not. The engagement of the current leadership is also highly laudable in terms of conflict resolution and mediation. The President spends most of his time working to resolve problems in countries such as Zimbabwe, Madagascar, and Somalia. The outside world looks to him and wants to learn what Tanzania is doing and why it is so committed to regional problem solving.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the Global 2013 Smart Partnership Dialogue mean for Tanzania?<br></h4><p>It is a crucial means of reaching a social consensus and recognizing that no one has all the answers. It reinforces the idea that if we talk together and share views and ideas we can devise broad based solutions of multilateral input. We do this in the spirit of a 'prosper thy neighbor' ideal, in which everybody gives, so everybody gains. It is not a zero-sum game. The other level of significance is the specific theme of the 2013 dialogue, which is leveraging technology for African socioeconomic transformation. Everyone knows the ability of technology to transform societies and improve efficiencies. Yet too many people in Africa and around the world remain excluded from social services, health, education, and finance. We have seen in many cases that technology can integrate more people quickly. This international event will bring companies and other stakeholders from around the world to Tanzania to share their experiences of how they use technology for rapid, equitable development.</p><h4>Tanzania's own political will is strongly aimed at achieving middle-income status by 2025. What are this administration's areas of strategic intervention to achieve this?</h4><p>We have a vision for 2025 that sees Tanzania becoming a middle-income country. We recently completed a review and realized that although our economy is growing at around 7% per annum, this is insufficient to render us a middle-income country by 2025. Thus, we are trying to find ways of fostering faster growth by intervening in sectors that could unlock our economy and enable double-digit growth. We must have the human resource capacity in order to truly transform our society and economy. We also consider water extremely important, and so another focus is resource mobilization. As our partners from Malaysia keep telling us, a plan without a budget is a draft. Therefore, we have to focus on domestic resource mobilization. Collectively, these are the priorities for 2013-2014. Now, we have to find out how technology can help us get more mileage in these priority areas.</p><h4>Tanzania is poised to become a global energy hotspot. What should be done to make sure the country's resources are a blessing and not a curse?</h4><p>We are grateful that we are latecomers because there are enough bad examples to avoid and best practices to follow. Firstly, we have the political determination to get it right. That means we have to learn, and we are willing to learn from everybody. We are looking at those countries that failed and those that succeeded while building our own policy framework and strategy in a manner that maximizes the benefits. Secondly, we will invest what we earn wisely, knowing that we are custodians of this resource for future generations. How to balance the needs of today with those of future generations is an important question. Another is how to build economies around gas. Our goals are to use gas to solve our electricity shortage, and to create downstream industries around it, such as petrochemicals and fertilizers. We also want to encourage entrepreneurs to begin thinking of the businesses that can develop to support and benefit from the gas economy. Skills and training will be needed at all levels, so this is a major focus. We are working with gas companies that can help us develop the most effective curricula and certification programs.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What will Tanzania bring to International Dialogue in terms of content and suggestions?<br></h4><p>The main theme of the International Dialogue is the leveraging of technology for the socioeconomic transformation of Africa. Based on our regional and national dialogues, we have determined the key pillars in terms of the technology transformation in Tanzania. This involves improving the efficiency and performance of laws and regulations, as well as developing infrastructure, energy resources, and education. We are going to build on the Tanzanian experience. At the Global 2013 Smart Partnership Dialogue in June, we hosted many participants from all over the world. During the conference, we looked at how other countries have utilized technology. In Africa, we also need to share with our peers in order to know whether the pillars we have identified are uniform across Africa, or whether others are required. We also expect the private sector, both foreign and domestic, to examine opportunities for sectors such as energy to develop technologically.</p><h4>How is ICT changing life in rural areas?</h4><p>First and foremost, what has been done in Tanzania in terms of telecommunications developments is significant. One of the challenges was access to finance in rural areas, but now with the introduction of mobile payments this has become much easier. It has even reached a point where people can carry out diverse activities via their mobile. The link between mobile firms and financial institutions is therefore very important, and has proven to be successful. The world can learn from it, as we can also learn from other countries' examples. Another priority area for the government is education, where e-learning has provided concrete solutions to certain previous limitations, and where in southern Tanzania for example students use laptops and iPads to acquire knowledge, quickly and conveniently. We are now working to reach every region of Tanzania with fiber optics, which will transfer knowledge effectively and uniformly—moreover, one teacher will be able to train others through e-learning methods. This is a huge country and our economy is growing, but we need technological solutions to make sure we reach as many people as possible. In major hospitals, there will also be doctors using these technologies to deliver training remotely, and so on. Elsewhere, if you have a smartphone, you don't need to wait for the weather report, which gives farmers a convenient solution that will transform agriculture. The distribution of agro-input can also be carried out more effectively through the use of mobile payment systems.</p><h4>How can the Global 2013 Smart Partnership Dialogue help Tanzania achieve its Vision 2025 goals?</h4><p>The methodology of the five-year plans that are taking us to Vision 2025 is significant, and the Smart Partnership National Dialogue helped people comprehend the plans and contribute to them in various ways. Another important aspect, beyond discussion itself, of course is monitoring and evaluation.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody1content><![CDATA[<h4>How does technology influence monetary policy in Tanzania?</h4><p>There are two media channels through which technology has a large influence on monetary policy. One is the payment system. There, we are seeing the introduction of the mobile payment as a platform for delivering a variety of services, which has already made a huge impact. The platform is widely available and the number of mobile money accounts that have been opened and registered is at almost 28 million; those in active use (defined as used once every 90 days according to a survey we undertook) number about 8.5 million. This comes from almost zero in 2008-2009, marking a very rapid rise. The reach is extremely wide, which means financial services are available for everyone, everywhere. This has also reduced the cost of delivering financial services. Using physical branches to reach everyone is simply too expensive. That is why we only have about 550 branches and 2,500 ATMs. Had we exclusively gone down that route, there is no way we could have reached the bulk of the country. Today, we are seriously working to increase the range of products that can be used on this platform. The first is money transfer, which has made a huge change in the way people interact in terms of transactions. It has also brought about a major change in terms of meeting social obligations. Funeral contributions, for example, are particularly important in Tanzanian society. Currently, for example, you can contribute to the cost a funeral from wherever you are over the phone. This method is also being used to pay bills and taxes. Additionally, banks have elected to use mobile payment agents to provide banking services, which means they can now expand the reach of their services. This has enabled us to leapfrog ahead to reach the majority of Tanzanians with financial services. Given our inadequate infrastructure, it has bridged distances. Of course, the big challenge now is to ensure that the system is secure. If we can't do so, mobile money services could well disappear. Fortunately, the tests that have been carried out internationally on mobile payment systems have proven very robust and resilient to abuse. As the Central Bank, our attitude is to let innovation take its course without being overcautious. However, that doesn't mean we can lower our guard on this. IT is another important direction, as it can do incredible things in terms of enhancing productivity and improving logistics. We often discuss the infrastructure bottleneck in Tanzania and investment in hardware; however, if we don't invest adequately on the logistics front too, we can't get the increased output to the destinations we require. The bulk of logistics operations depend on IT. It is time to seriously talk about the importance of technology in improving our logistics capacity. We have invested in more than 10,000 kilometers of fiber-optic network, covering the whole country, which also connects to undersea cables. We have also connected our neighbors to these cables using the fiber-optic network. It is now time to see how services can be offered using this particular investment. We need to define how IT and data firms can invest in providing services to Tanzania and make the country a gateway for data services in the region. There is no doubt that we have made huge progress in terms of the internet, enabling us to access financial services. We used to see people bring their bidding forms to the Central Bank in person; now, it is all done online. Given the ubiquity of access to high-speed, low-cost internet, I believe we should be able to automate a wider range of financial services and make them more efficient and cost effective.</p><h4>What can regional central banks learn from each other?</h4><p>Central banks have tended to be pioneers in the expansion of technology for financial inclusion. Most of the members of the Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) are central banks. We have a chapter that deals only with mobile money among African central banks. This is one area where Africa is a pioneer, so we have a lot to learn from each other. Unfortunately, not everyone has moved as quickly as Kenya or Tanzania, but this provides us with an opportunity to engage in a dialogue about what it takes to be successful and sustainable.</p><h4>How does technology influence the gathering of economic information?</h4><p>First, it has significantly simplified data collection, storage, and analysis. There are surveys that we can now do simply via mobile phone, which is quicker, easier, and cheaper than ever before. These form the best set of attributes for good research. Secondly, it is important to interact at the frontier of knowledge, which is accessible via the internet, the data systems of highly reputable institutions, and video conferencing. Today, we can engage with leading economists without calling a conference and bringing them all here in person.</p><div class="quote">“  It is time to seriously talk about the importance of technology in improving our logistics capacity. "</div><h4>How will the implementation of technology in Tanzania's banking sector help it to achieve its Vision 2025 goal of becoming a middle-income country?</h4><p>IT is a powerful tool for productivity growth. In order to achieve the goals for 2025, we have to raise our growth rate above the current 7%. We have done the arithmetic and we need to grow by between 8% and 10%. Technology will help us to improve that productivity. Logistics and organization are important parts of gaining efficiency. Technology is also helping even SMEs get better market data, information on crop husbandry, and extension services—it provides remote access to expert information. The most significant aspect is the productivity-enhancing and growth-enhancing features of technology. Another part is simply giving us the ability to learn from others much more effectively and quickly in terms of access to information about best practices. Technology allows us to access non-resident expertise, also on the medical front. It is no longer necessary to fly in a consultant or surgeon to treat the patient. I also believe that technology will allow our diaspora to return virtually rather than physically to play a role in our economy. Top professors teaching elsewhere in the world can offer courses here and guide research remotely, even when they can't find time to come back physically. It is truly a platform for quantum change in the way we do business.</p>]]></richbody1content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for Ksara in the past two years?<br></h4><p>Chí¢teau Ksara has substantially increased its production to 3 million bottles per annum since 2010. Our restaurant has also become a real masterpiece after its expansion and now attracts a huge number of visitors. The worldwide economic crisis and the war in Syria have affected the wine sector as with most other sectors of the economy. The decline in the number of tourists coming to Lebanon has reduced local consumption. Chí¢teau Ksara had foremost focused on the local market before expanding to exports; however, both markets are complementary. The world is big and Lebanon's production is small, yet it is excellent. We have great potential for growth and excellent opportunities lie ahead of us.</p><h4>Which countries do you mainly export to, and what new markets are you looking into?</h4><p>Our regional exports are to Jordan, the UAE, and Syria, which was an important market for us. However, with the current situation there, our sales have dropped considerably. Europe is another of our traditional markets, particularly France, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, and Scandinavia. We also have small sales in Russia and Belarus. In the Far East, we are targeting China, Japan, and possibly India soon.</p><h4>How are Lebanese wines perceived abroad?</h4><p>Our wines enjoy an excellent reputation abroad with, in my view, one of the best qualities for value in the world. We do not have high-end wines with price tags over ‚¬1,000 per bottle. Our prices range from ‚¬6 to ‚¬40, and at these price levels our wines are highly appreciated.</p><h4>What do you believe needs to be done to further boost and develop the wine sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>The Ministry of Agriculture and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Agriculture are aware of the importance of the wine sector. Although their financial assistance is limited, they are doing their best to help. The Ministry of Agriculture financed the Lebanese Wine Day in Paris on May 14, 2013 and will do the same for the Lebanese Wine Day in Berlin in 2014. We are currently negotiating with the Chamber of Commerce for a contribution to the participation costs in the ProWein International Wine Fair exhibition in Düsseldorf. The Managing Director of the International Organization of Vine and Wine (OIV) has been officially invited to Lebanon with a delegation to seal the relationship between the OIV and our country, while the Director General of the Ministry of Agriculture, Louis Lahoud, has been appointed Representative of Lebanon to the OIV and Vice-President of the Economy and Law Commission.</p><h4>What investment plans do you have in mind for 2014?</h4><p>We will be signing an agreement shortly for the commissioning of a new warehouse facility of 2,600 sqm. This will be our main investment for 2014. We invest in pallets and oak barrels on an annual basis and renew our equipment whenever needed. Our winery is located in the heart of the Bekaa Valley. The name of the location is Ksara, situated 45 kilometers east of Beirut. Our main offices and warehouses are located in Beirut. Our warehouses are supplied on a daily basis with a buffer stock to protect us from any shortages due to road closures in the winter because of snow or other unexpected accidents. Needless to say, the majority of restaurants and supermarkets are located in the outer Beirut area, which makes it necessary for a company of our size to cover distribution in Beirut as well.</p><h4>What plans do you have to further consolidate your strong position as a key player in the wine sector?</h4><p>In Lebanon, we are privileged by a reputation and a market size that put us at the top of the wine producers list. To maintain this privilege, we need to permanently invest in our equipment, in our storage facilities, and in the quantity and quality of our grapes. We will continue to do so and we will remain the market leaders in Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Mövenpick Hotel &amp; Resorts Beirut has been ranked the best resort in Lebanon. What has contributed to this success?</h4><p>Obviously, the human factor. The team itself has been very much focused on making this the resort to visit in Lebanon, especially in Beirut. It is not only the team; the location itself is also quite convenient. The fact is that the facilities and the activities that we provide are something that you can't really find anywhere else in Lebanon. We have three different swimming pools, which is unique here. The Olympic-sized pool is one example, and we also offer water sport activities. I don't think you can find those in any other resort. We have powerboats, jet skis, parasailing, and the largest diving center in Lebanon. You can rent any type or size of yacht and go directly from your room to the yacht and go wherever you want. That is basically everything you need without having to take a car to go anywhere. It is all private, so you have to be a hotel guest or the owner of a cabana.</p><h4>What is the percentage of international visitors?</h4><p>In the sense of people who live outside Lebanon, it is close to 100%. Many of the people who come here are the Lebanese who live abroad. We know that about 20 million Lebanese live abroad, versus the 4 million here. This is the diaspora. The Middle East loves this country. It is the Europe of the Middle East. It is very close by and we speak the same language. People from the region feel more comfortable here and they feel more at home than they do in Europe.</p><h4>What are the advantages of Lebanon as a tourist destination?</h4><p>It is a small place that has basically nearly everything. In terms of culture and history, it is very deep. It is the heart of civilization. It has gone through many eras. It has a very strong history and everything you want to visit at a maximum of two hours away. One of the great advantages here is the weather. We have over 300 days of clear blue skies. Even if you go to the Caribbean, Indonesia, or Malaysia, you won't experience so many blue skies. In Singapore, it rains every day. You can even go outside in the summer, whereas in most Middle Eastern countries you cannot, due to the heat. Furthermore, there are winter facilities in the mountains where you can engage in winter sports.</p><h4>What are you doing to push MICE tourism?</h4><p>Russia has direct flights, and visa restrictions are not an issue for its citizens coming here. Beirut is only three-and-a-half hours from Moscow, and there is a lot of MICE activity going on. We also need to consider how much we should invest in pushing the MICE business in countries that we know would not choose our destination out of safety concerns. We know that safety comes before anything else. Now, that said, we have a couple of leads and we have had some visits from Russia because this is a fantastic MICE destination. It is easy to get to different destinations from Lebanon.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese tourism sector in the medium term?</h4><p>For 2014, I would like to be optimistic, but it is difficult to predict. I think if we look at how things are developing in the region, especially with our neighbor Syria, we are totally dependent on what is happening externally. Things have not been going in the right direction recently. We do not believe it is going to get any worse, but we are not unrealistic and dreaming that business is going to go through the roof. The political situation seems to have changed, and it seems to have had a positive impact on traveling in the GCC. We suddenly see a surge of reservations for individual leisure travelers from the GCC. Lebanese tourism is a roller coaster; it goes up and down, and is extremely reliant on day-to-day politics. It all depends on the kind of support that you get from the Gulf because it is very complex.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What main services do you offer to investors and foreign companies?<br></h4><p>Our firm is often the first port of call for clients looking to invest or do business in Lebanon and in the region, particularly in Qatar and Iraq. A significant proportion of our clients are foreign, including individuals, SMEs, and multinationals. Our primary role is to advise our clients on all matters legal and regulatory. Our team of more than 30 lawyers covers a wide range of practice areas, including, among others, commercial, corporate, real estate, banking, finance, and oil and gas law. But through our exposure to so many transactions over the past decades, we can often offer valuable insights to our clients when navigating this market. This is my 46th year in the firm and the profession. I cannot begin to tell you the changes I have seen in how business is done. Just like our clients, we have adapted to the constantly evolving business landscape, learning new techniques, new sectors, and new transaction structures as they develop.</p><h4>What should foreign companies be aware of before engaging in their start-up phase?</h4><p>There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Whatever you require, there are people in Lebanon who can help you get it done well and quickly. We are very lucky in Lebanon to have, among other things of course, very high-caliber human resources, including lawyers, accountants, bankers, M&amp;A advisors, financial specialists, and fiduciary specialists. My primary advice to foreign companies, which no doubt applies everywhere, is to make sure they surround themselves with the right local advisors. Beyond this, foreign companies should be aware of the structures that are available for their businesses in Lebanon. There are various forms of companies that can be set up, as well as branches, representative offices, and more, or they can operate in a joint-venture type structure with an existing Lebanese entity. Each structure has its benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to find something that makes sense for each specific transaction. New entrants to this market should take the time to explore the market well: it's a special market, with considerable potential, but it's important to understand it properly. And, finally, don't underestimate the value of Beirut as a regional platform.</p><h4>What regulatory changes are we likely to see over the medium term?</h4><p>A new capital markets law has gone into effect, and it is likely to bring in some changes over the coming months and years as it evolves and settles. Finance is a sector that has always moved fast, and Lebanon has always been very good at balancing between evolving its regulatory regime while not taking too many risks; this is what saved us from suffering direct exposure to the financial crisis, although, of course, the country was somewhat affected by knock-on effects, which is inevitable. Another sector the regulatory regime which often comes up is oil and gas. As you know, there are significant exploration and exploitation opportunities in offshore hydrocarbons, and so far our governments have been ineffective in laying down the regulatory framework for this. We hope that 2014 will see a lot of activity in this field. Finally, I would have liked to see some modernization of our code of commerce, notably with regard to corporate structures, in order to integrate some of the flexibilities that other jurisdictions enjoy. However, I do not think that we will see a change in this in 2014, as it is not as pressing as other sectors.</p><h4>How would you assess Lebanon's legal environment?</h4><p>Lebanon's legal environment is, by and large, quite solid. Of course, there are some challenges, and some areas of the legal framework require an overhaul. However, overall, the legal framework has many virtues. We have an extensive body of laws, and these are generally well drafted and applied by legal practitioners and the judiciary. We also have some sophistications that are not very well known and, in my view, under-used. For example, Lebanon has a law governing the “fiducie" structure, which fulfills many of the advantages of the “trust." Coupled with Lebanon's strong banking sector and good tax regime, the fiducie can be a very powerful tool for a variety of purposes. I can therefore safely say that, with the right partners and advice, the legal environment is not an obstacle to conducting business in Lebanon.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>SABIS® member schools are present in 15 countries on four continents. What is behind the company's success story?<br></h4><p>SABIS® member schools around the world have always been driven by a clear vision to raise education standards. The first school in what later became the SABIS® School Network started in 1886 with a view to providing girls in the village of Choueifat, Lebanon, with an education. Very soon after that first school was opened, the villagers asked the school to admit boys because girls were starting to learn more than their male counterparts. In 1975, due to the civil war, the first school outside of Lebanon was established. The SABIS® School Network, through its various offices around the world, has continued on an expansion path since then. Fuelling the successful expansion of the network is the fact that SABIS® member schools have access to the right methodology and assessment tools, which allow them to ensure that learning is happening in the classroom. With a new school set to open in Panama in 2015, the SABIS®School Network will expand to include a 16th country. Expansion is an ongoing process and comes as a result of a commitment to raise education standards around the world regardless of the challenges. SABIS® is driven by the realization that education can basically change the world.</p><h4>What different models does SABIS® follow?</h4><p>SABIS® member schools are college-preparatory schools that serve students from pre-school and kindergarten to grade 12. Schools within the SABIS® School Network operate under one of three operational models. There are private schools, public schools, and schools that license the SABIS® Educational System. Private schools that are members of the SABIS® School Network operate all around the world, from the US to Pakistan. The SABIS® School Network in the US also includes public charter schools that are overseen by SABIS® Educational Systems. The global SABIS® School Network also includes public schools in the Kurdish region of Northern Iraq. These schools start as primary schools, and upon renewal of the management contract, gradually expand to serve students up through grade 12. The SABIS® franchising or licensing model was introduced six years ago and offers schools the opportunity to license the proven SABIS® Educational System. The SABIS® US office currently works with two licensees in the US; one in New York City with three existing schools and plans to add two more schools in 2013-14, and one in New Jersey. The network also has another licensee in Romania.</p><h4>What role does technology play for SABIS®?</h4><p>The SABIS® Educational System is performance-driven and fuelled by ongoing access to data. Teachers and administrators in SABIS® member schools around the world use proprietary SABIS® IT tools and systems to monitor student learning on a daily basis. Individuals employed by SABIS® regional offices around the world also access the data to ensure the integrity and effectiveness of the system. At any moment in time, through the comprehensive IT systems available, it is possible to monitor performance across the network, in member schools in Lahore, Pakistan, New Orleans, the US, Frankfurt, Germany, Dubai, UAE, and Lebanon.</p><h4>What are the Lebanese education system's weaknesses and advantages?</h4><p>Lebanon differentiates itself from other countries in that its private education sector is strong and well established. That, unfortunately, is a result of the weak public education sector. Having said that, public education worldwide is not performing the way it should. This is why the US came up with the charter school model and is privatizing public education or introducing the private sector to the public sector. In Lebanon, we have a strong private sector. Through the competition that SABIS® member schools have helped spark, the private education sector in Lebanon has been strengthened. What differentiates SABIS® schools from all of the other private schools is that SABIS® member schools implement a non-selective admissions policy. Most private schools—in Lebanon and indeed around the world—tend to be very selective in nature. SABIS® member schools, on the other hand, pride themselves on being academically non-selective. As long as an applicant does not have any major disabilities that the school is not equipped to handle, SABIS® member schools can work with almost any student to raise his or her education level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the higher education sector in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>The education sector in Lebanon has grown significantly over the past two decades. Lebanon used to have a dozen institutions that had been around for quite a while, but recently that number has jumped close to 50. Previously, there were mostly not-for-profit institutions, and now there are a number of for-profit institutions. This puts clear challenges in terms of maintaining quality, and there are efforts now by the Ministry of Education and the established educational institutions to put measures in place to ensure the quality of education. There are many new laws that are either under consideration or have already been passed by the Ministry. This illustrates that education is in high demand in Lebanon and the region. There isn't a single, exclusive economic sector in Lebanon that is dominant. Lebanon depends on its human and knowledge economy more than anything. We have always produced expertise that has served not only Lebanon, but also the entire region. Increasingly, we are producing students that can compete not just on the local and regional level, but globally. Our graduate students are going all around the world. There are a number of older, established universities, and in the past few decades there has been an explosion of new ones. The Lebanese University is one of the older institutions. Not all programs are equally strong, but some are very strong. In recent years, reforms were introduced in higher education, including some recent reforms that were introduced in the Lebanese University. The Lebanese University is very large; it has branches throughout the country and the largest number of enrolled students. All the other universities are private. They have the same types of challenges that other institutions have—and maybe more so in Lebanon.</p><h4>What role do agreements with other universities play for AUB?</h4><p>Over the past four years, we have signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with more than 60 universities. Historically, our strongest relationships have been with North American universities. However, increasingly, we are starting MoUs with European universities. We have embarked on partnerships with multiple universities, both in Lebanon and in the Arab world. We are also beginning to look east and start relationships with universities in Asia. We already have a relationship with the National University of Singapore. We don't have anything in the works right now, but we also hope to establish links with India. The MoUs can take a number of different forms: they can be student exchange, research exchange, and so on.</p><h4>What role do international students play at AUB?</h4><p>Before the civil war, about half of the student body was made up of international students from the region and beyond. The numbers of courses dropped during the civil war, and we have been trying to improve these numbers. It fluctuates between 26% and 28%, which is lower than what we used to have, but is quite significant compared to many international institutions.</p><h4>What is AUB's relation to business and industry?</h4><p>Large engineering companies have historically hired our students and we have had beneficial relationships with them. These relationships haven't been standardized to the extent that they could be. Our business school, for example, has an executive education program that provides customized programs to various businesses. These programs are not as large as they could be, but they do exist and we are developing them further. We collaborate in terms of research with some of the major engineering companies. For example, Intel funds certain projects; we were offered very high-end, expensive software from Schlumberger and there are other similar examples. We work with ministries to provide educational programs for employees. This is another form of serving the region, and providing consultancy, expertise, and services to the larger community. There is more of that to be done. This also provides funding, especially when there is research involved, which everyone benefits from. This is not common in the region as of yet. Of course, all engineers have to do an internship, and the same goes for business graduates, but I'm talking about more structured relationships with industry and how this translates into research projects funded partly from outside. This is a challenge for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the most important developments for Kefraya?<br></h4><p>One of the most important developments was the decision to build the winery, because we were selling our grapes to other wineries previously. During the so-called civil war in 1979, we decided to produce our first wine. Other highlights included enlarging the winery, planting trees, building gardens, opening the restaurant and wine shop, and, above everything else, making our work accessible to tourists who want to learn more about Kefraya. I believe the most beautiful sight to see in springtime and in June is the vineyard. Everything is green, all of the vines are healthy, the soil is plowed, and the areas are cleared of weeds. A great moment was also when we discovered six ancient tombs on our grounds. They have been cleaned and are now open for visitors.</p><h4>Where do most of your visitors come from?</h4><p>We receive around 35,000 visitors a year. Of that total, approximately half are Lebanese and the other half are foreign citizens.</p><h4>How is the wine culture in Lebanon developing?</h4><p>The Lebanese are becoming more and more accustomed to wine, and awareness is better now than it was 30 years ago. Many people appreciate Lebanese wine, but sometimes they are more interested in foreign wines that are widely recognized abroad. Several wine critics, such as Robert Baker, have advocated our wine. In Baker's magazine, Wine Advocate, our wine was tasted and analyzed by him and he said it was an amazing accomplishment in Lebanon. That was also the title of the article. We frequently attend a number of expositions. We have been to the London International Wine Fair, France, Germany, and Sweden. We participate in those events and our brands are present at many cocktail functions where wine is served.</p><div class="quote">“  We export to many countries around the world, such as the UK, the US, and Sweden. "</div><h4>Where do you export to mostly?</h4><p>We export to many countries around the world, such as the UK, the US, and Sweden. There are perhaps 40 countries we export to. We are always looking at new countries to access. In the next year, we hope we will be in Asia, because that region seems very interesting—India, China, and Singapore in particular.</p><h4>What is your annual production?</h4><p>When we launched the company, arak was very important as a northern wine. We used to produce around 14,000 cases. However, now we only produce 3,000-4,000 cases. As for wine, we produce around 2 million bottles per year.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the company?</h4><p>Our strategy is marked on the bottle in Latin, semper ultra. Although nobody sees it or even notices it is there, it is written on every bottle. Semper ultra means never stop, or go further and better, and that is our aim. Of course, we are always experimenting with new wines.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Bellevue Medical Centre (BMC) became a university hospital affiliated to Université Saint-Joseph in July 2010. How have things changed since?<br></h4><p>The effects on patient safety have been very high because the presence of both residents and interns helps in assuring that our patients are in good hands all the time. There are cases in which, for instance, the attending physician is not available and, in a normal hospital, the doctor would just come, attend the patient, and leave. Here, on the other hand, at a university hospital like ours, medical students, usually in the last few years of their specialty, can tend to the patients. The second enrichment that comes from being a university hospital is the positive impact on research, which is essential in the medical sector. The teaching environment and the research keep the staff, and their medical skills, up to date and well polished.</p><h4>You also received Joint Commission International (JCI) accreditation. What is the significance of this?</h4><p>This accreditation was established in the 1950s in the US. By that time, it was decided that standards were required in order to assess patient care. After a period of development, it came to represent the main accreditation body for healthcare in the US, with there now being more than 20,000 accredited hospitals. It is dedicated solely to healthcare services and has become desirable abroad. However, some standards are only applicable in the US; for example, with regard to insurance, the Joint Commission formed a group to create the JCI, taking the standards of the US and applying them to the rest of the world, by taking into account cultural and legal differences, observing more than 2,000 measurable elements inside hospitals. This is how JCI came to be and because of our nature, being a hospital that was built on international standards, especially with regard to safety and hospital design, it became important to ask the JCI to review BMC. Our hospital is recognized as having the best hospital design. For example, there are elements that people would not even normally notice, such as laminar flows in the operating rooms, which are quite expensive, but the hospital has acquired them since they are crucial for avoiding infections.</p><h4>What medical treatments do you specialize in?</h4><p>Ours is a general hospital, which means that we treat a wide range of medical conditions. At the moment, we do not do renal dialysis or open-heart surgery. We have high-quality cosmetic surgery services, and we are proud of our excellent orthopedic department, which includes a large physiotherapy department with hydrotherapy. Our well sought after maternity unit is now developing into a center of excellence, which will be completed in 2014. In addition to this, we have a large psychiatric unit designed according to international standards, which is something that not many hospitals in the Middle East are equipped with. Special efforts have been made to ensure the safety of psychiatric patients, including design methods that reduce the possibility of suicide by those whose conditions need particular assistance. Moreover, we have just inaugurated the breast cancer center, where different doctors and services provided in one setting treat the patient with a holistic approach.</p><h4>What balance do you have between local and foreign patients?</h4><p>Our hospital has dedicated an international patient office to serving international patients; however, the majority of our patients remain Lebanese. The political turbulence in the country during the last few months did not hugely affect our growth, which was at 43% previously, although it was slightly higher at 56% in 2012.</p><h4>What would you say are the challenges in the sector?</h4><p>The number one challenge is related to the emigration of qualified nurses from the country, which has created a huge demand. Another main issue for us is the unstable political situation in the country, which causes challenges related to attracting patients from overseas. In BMC, despite our high operational cost due to the excellent-quality facility, the latest medical equipment, high nurse to patient ratio, and professional staff of a high caliber, our prices are very competitive in the market and affordable for international as well as national patients.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for the Lebanese American University (LAU) in the past two years?<br></h4><p>There are many achievements that make us proud. In terms of our capital programs, we have just completed the construction of a new building on the Byblos Campus, the Gilbert and Rose-Mary Chagoury Health Sciences Center, which will house the Gilbert and Rose-Marie Chagoury School of Medicine, the School of Pharmacy, and the Alice Ramez Chagoury School of Nursing. We are also in the process of constructing a new building for the Engineering School, which will house all the engineering labs: civil, mechanical, electric, computing, and industrial. Our School of Engineering is ABET accredited. Also, on the Byblos campus, we need a new library. Planning for a new library is underway, and construction will soon follow. In addition, we are putting in new infrastructure for the Byblos campus, which will cost us around $25 million. The campus has grown, and it needs stronger and sturdier infrastructure to support it. We are also in the process of renovating our newly acquired University Medical Center in East Beirut, where our students from the three health-related schools (medicine, pharmacy, and nursing) do their training and internships. On the Beirut campus, we are completing renovations on all our older buildings, including infrastructure upgrades. We are also renovating a new acquisition near our campus, the Gezairi building and school, which will house our architecture and design programs, including the newly established fashion design program. We are currently in the process of planning for a new building in Beirut that will house the School of Arts and Sciences.</p><h4>In terms of academic programs, which additions have you made recently?</h4><p>We have a lot going on at the moment, and we are starting a new program in fashion design. This new program is named after Elie Saab, a world-renown Lebanese fashion designer. The second program is actuarial sciences; insurance companies need actuaries that can use mathematical and statistical modeling to predict the average age of people. This will give insurance companies the opportunity to frame their premiums and project their profit margins. Thirdly, we have a new program: a Master's in Gender Studies. It is designed to respond to the needs of both men and women and help them gain a better knowledge of their respective roles in society. A fourth program, Informatics, brings together biology, mathematics, and computer science in a very effective interdisciplinary fashion. And finally, we put in place a program in Conflict Resolution because it is so sorely needed, given the bloody conflicts that are raging the world over.</p><h4>What are your prospects for LAU in New York?</h4><p>We are an American university chartered in New York, and, therefore, we wanted to own a location in downtown Manhattan to house our headquarters and a major academic center. We acquired a three-story building that has been completely renovated and was inaugurated on September 13, 2013. Over and above serving as our headquarters, the new premises will house a new academic center where we will offer pertinent courses to US students, such as Arabic, Islamic banking, and how to do business in the Arab world. We are talking to institutions in New York, such as NYU and Columbia, and in the entire New England region, about how we can be partners and complement their educational mission by offering courses that their students need and that they do not offer themselves. We are all excited about this major project that constitutes a milestone in the evolution of LAU.</p><h4>LAU has been investing heavily in technology for all of its campuses. What major advances have been implemented?</h4><p>Our campus was among the first campuses, if not the first, to go wireless, which is very significant. We have been at the cutting-edge of technology, despite major challenges and enormous costs. We have made sure that our students have the best training in technology and its many applications, which usually allows them to land on their feet and readily find employment. The progress that LAU has realized in IT has been absolutely phenomenal, be it in the classroom, on the web, or in e-mail structures.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Fashion Trading Company (Hugo Boss) is present in 12 countries. What does Lebanon mean for the company?<br></h4><p>FTC is a family-owned business. We are the agent of Hugo Boss for the entire Middle East, so we carry out operations for the brand across 12 countries. We have franchise stores in 10 countries and the rest are multi-brand channels. Lebanon represents almost 10% of the entire Middle East market when it comes to the fashion industry. Nevertheless, Lebanon means a lot to FTC since the company was born in Beirut and currently is still based here.</p><h4>How has the fashion industry in Lebanon developed over the years, and how is it perceived externally?</h4><p>Lebanon has always been the most advanced country in terms of fashion. The fashion industry has developed quite a lot over past years. More and more brands from all categories have opened in Lebanon. Luxury brands have expanded in downtown Beirut, whereas the other segments have in malls or highstreet destinations like Hamra and Kaslik. Externally, Lebanon is perceived as a niche market. Lebanon doesn't have the biggest windows, but definitely it has a niche one since the offer is much smaller. Saying that, they concentrate on niche products to seduce clientéle. It is more homogenous and they have to make sure to choose a nice collection since they don't just sell to expatriates or tourists, but mostly to local people. Lebanon is considered the window of the Middle East because of its large diaspora, which gives it an edge in fashion. If you attend an event or walk around during the day, you will find people dressed up fashionably; and this for me is a true indicator of the country's fashion culture. Lebanese women are trendsetters. Other GCC countries may have the stores, but the locals haven't embraced it. Dubai, however, is a larger market and leads the industry.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in consumer habits?</h4><p>The trend is changing in Lebanon. Shopping used to be only about high street destinations, like Hamra, Verdun, Kaslik, and other high-end streets in the downtown area. However, in the past five years, we have seen more and more malls opening up, and so the industry is shifting from a street destination to a mall one. Malls offer convenience—everything is under one roof. Hugo Boss, however, is a street destination brand. I do not like the shift into malls in Lebanon. We can have commercial stores in malls, but Downtown Beirut is currently the best destination for luxury, and that is where all the premium brands are.</p><h4>How are the premium brands performing in Lebanon?</h4><p>We are doing well. In 2012, we maintained the same numbers as in 2011, which is good because many others suffered. For 2013, we are expecting to sustain the 2012 figures. I am not expecting any growth. Unfortunately, we have not grown for a couple of years due to the poor political situation. Lebanon was much healthier in 2009 and 2010. The premium brands could perform much better if the situation calmed down. They should do much better since the stores are not big enough. If you compare the stores in Lebanon to the ones in the GCC, they are much smaller—and that is an indication in itself.</p><h4>How would you assess the importance of local brands versus international ones?</h4><p>Local brands are very poor for men and brilliant for women. However, there are many upcoming stars for the future. We are extremely famous in haute couture, and its importance is really big compared to the international names. Brands like Elie Saab, Rabih Keyrouz, Mahfouz, and Hobeika are competing fiercely with international brands, such as Vera Wang. We have some other good emerging designers too, for example Sandra Mansour and Rani Zkhem. There are many smaller brands too that sell accessories in the mid- to high-price range. Lebanese designers are very talented with regard to women's haute couture and accessories, but not so talented when it comes to men's fashion. I would like to see more local brands in that segment as well as in the women's príªt-á-porter.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Lebanese retail sector?<br></h4><p>Overall, 2013 has been a difficult year in terms of retail. We had negative growth, and this is in the context of increasing costs; the cost of labor, real estate, and energy have all been increasing, while revenues are going down. This is also in the context of increased competition and the opening of new shopping centers, and, therefore, the combination of inflating costs, more competition, and a reduction in revenues is a difficult situation that we have never seen before. The mix of travel warnings, lower consumer confidence, and also the fact that there are more suppliers has together made an impact. Also, it is normal that in the beginning people want to go and see the new shopping centers.</p><h4>What are ABC's competitive advantages?</h4><p>ABC has been in the market for 75 years; it is part of Lebanese culture. It is the second home for Lebanese people, and I would say that is one of our most competitive advantages. We are part of the Lebanese lifestyle, we are part of the values, and we are a household brand. The other advantage is that we try to be an entertainment destination. It is not just about retail; it is about being in the family, walking around, having a coffee, and going to the movies, for example. It is not only about the buying; it is about the whole experience, and that is what we try to do to keep ahead of other competitors.</p><h4>How is the leasing part of the business developing?</h4><p>We have what we call a “brand committee," which is a team that decides on the brands. It is not about price; it is about finding the right combination of low-, medium-, and high-end brands and the right categories of products. It is about understanding what people want, what our customers want, and then providing them with these brands. There are many, many selection criteria, and every brand that comes to us has to go through this process.</p><div class="quote">“  ABC has been in the market for 
75 years; it is part of Lebanese culture. 
It is the second home for Lebanese people. "</div><h4>ABC Group has invested in Dbayeh. What are your plans for this mall and what other short-term investment plans do you have in mind?</h4><p>We invested a lot over 2012, and we have expanded and renovated our current locations. We also just signed with a partner to open a shopping center in Verdun. In our business, we cannot make our decisions based on the sales strength of the last three or six months because ours are projects that can take up to five years; we cannot wait five years to make a decision. We know of the ups and downs and we are committed to Lebanon. We still have a profitable operation and we will keep investing. The mall in Verdun will be 50% larger than Achrafieh, and it is due to open in 2017. That is a huge investment—approximately $300 million. It is bigger, so there will be more brands, and it will hopefully improve the shopping experience in this part of the country, which is the last untapped high-spending area.</p><h4>What percentage of consumers shop online?</h4><p>The percentage is very small. We are looking into e-commerce, like many others, but the problem that we are facing is that Lebanon is a small market, and also geographically small. It is not small in terms of dollars, therefore people come to ABC. Why would they shop online to get any product when they could spend a lot of time physically in what we call “the bricks and mortar?" The combination of those two factors is what makes it difficult to develop e-commerce in Lebanon.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of retail in Beirut?</h4><p>People like to talk about Beirut as being the fashion capital of the Middle East, but I believe Beirut is somehow a trendsetter in the area. We need more stability, because there is so much potential. We have the weather, we have the culture, the freedom, the mix of people; we have everything that it takes except stability.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[the-midas-touch]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Tufenkjian Frí¨res evolved in recent years?<br></h4><p>Our company is over 100 years old. It was started by my father, and it is run today by myself and my two brothers. We have expanded the company from being a small jewelry shop to an international name. Since 1909, Tufenkjian has been designing jewelry for a discerning clientí¨le who seek treasures that are stunning and timeless. Traveling from all over the globe, jewelry lovers enter our luxurious showroom knowing they will find precious gems, captivating designs, and the superior quality they desire. Today, we are proud to carry on our father's legacy as Lebanon's most prestigious fine jeweler, recognized for our expertise and for our ability to consistently create jewelry that dreams are made of. We have earned an unrivaled reputation for jewelry excellence in the region.</p><h4>Where do most of your customers come from?</h4><p>Many Arab countries are experiencing instability at the moment, and Europe is in a bad economic situation as well. Traditionally, our customers are from the Gulf, Europe, and the US. In addition, we also have some buyers from Africa.</p><h4>How has Tufenkjian been performing in Lebanon?</h4><p>In recent years, we have experienced our best era, and the banking sector was able to support the jewelry businesses very well. Our fashion and tastes lie between the Arab world and Europe, and takes the best parts of both. This makes it more creative than other countries in terms of design.</p><div class="quote">“  We are waiting and watching to see what happens, and then we will decide on an active strategy. "</div><h4>What would you say makes the Lebanese customer unique?</h4><p>First, there are those that live in Lebanon on a relatively low salary. They tend to choose fashionable, smaller products. The Lebanese people who work abroad are generous and come back to Lebanon for their vacations. While they are here, they buy products like anyone from the Gulf region.</p><h4>What is the focus of your growth strategy?</h4><p>Currently, ours is a defensive strategy. We are waiting and watching to see what happens, and then we will decide on an active strategy. The sector is not performing as it has in previous years. This year has been very bad. With the travel alert, our sales to foreigners have dropped dramatically. In order to keep the company surviving, we are traveling to other countries and selling in our customers' own territories.</p><h4>How is Tufenkjian perceived in the region?</h4><p>We only have a store under our name in Jordan. In other countries, we sell to the big name shops, which distribute our products. We focus on what we are good at, and this has allowed us to survive. Our clients must be able to trust us and rely on us.</p><h4>Where do you see the company in 10 years, and what is your outlook on the future of the sector in general?</h4><p>When you are in a defensive mode, it is difficult to answer that question. If you ask me in six months then I can give you a better reply, but right now we are on standby. Lebanon is a free country and you can run your business openly, with no need for clandestine transactions. In situations where there are no restrictions on your business, you have the opportunity to grow. However, in my opinion, the market is currently oversaturated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are the advantages of Lebanon as a regional entertainment hub?<br></h4><p>The main advantage is the people themselves, who take pleasure in socializing and enjoy spending money. In addition, of course, there are the diverse outdoor venues, while in the summer it's difficult to resist the call of the beach. The entertainment business is kept alive by ordinary people who run their own businesses, rather than by major investors. The bars are usually run by the owners themselves. Many young people who started from scratch ended up opening their own premises, and hence the market tends to be more local than big-chain oriented. This adds a personal flavor to the entertainment scene. It is also quite unlike the regular scenario in Europe, where the streets feature anonymous huge bars without a personal story.</p><h4>What makes the Lebanese customer unique?</h4><p>Lebanese people are very open minded and accept changes in entertainment, but not in terms of culinary taste. They enjoy eating Lebanese food, and that is why all of the restaurants have the same menus. Lebanese food is excellent. However, this aside, the entertainment sector is open to music and anything new. That is why Lebanon cannot easily be compared to other tourist destinations. People enjoying the nightlife today have been doing so for the past 10 years in an atmosphere of familiarity. This makes for a very local market where people tend to know each other. Tourists usually tend to mingle and dance, but that is not really the case with the locals. It is a very small community. A couple of years ago, the situation was different because there were many more tourists. On another level, Lebanon would clearly suffer without the regular contribution of Lebanese expatriates. Few understand that the Lebanese economy has been floated on families' wealthy children living abroad, or by the comfortable uncle or aunt who pays the bills. These expatriates absolutely sustain this country. In short, Lebanese people are eager to spend, and love to party.</p><h4>What makes White different from other clubs in Lebanon?</h4><p>White is a more fun and cozy place compared with other entertainment venues in Lebanon. We stage dance shows regularly, and our primary mission is to ensure that our customers are having fun. This concept was borrowed from my sister, who is the official architect at all of our venues. She created the name and the concept of White. The name itself comes from the fact that the club is located on a rooftop, and can be lit with different colors. However, we usually use white light to illuminate the dark night around our customers. Being surrounded by light creates a certain positive vibe. White is more appealing for an open-air venue in stark contrast to the subterranean atmosphere of clubbing venues that some find dark and unwelcoming. In fact, for this reason, White is appealing to all generations. In addition, we play a chilled and commercial music set, compared to the usual clubs, where “underground" music is the norm. We are not in the market for heavy music, but seek our customers' happiness. People dance much more at White than at other venues, largely because of the choice of music.</p><h4>Is Addmind planning to open any new venues abroad?</h4><p>We are opening Iris in Abu Dhabi on Yas Island, where the Formula One event takes place, a truly beautiful location. Additionally, we opened a club similar to White in Dubai on August 22, 2013. In Lebanon, the market is already saturated, so we are currently brainstorming ways to expand in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Shanghai. The problem is that the Lebanese market experiences many up and downs. Indeed, 2013 has been a notably unsuccessful year in terms of profits. In light of this instability, when volatility arises, we have to close, which means 300 employees have lost their income. This happened to us during the war. In contrast, however, when business comes, it booms. The huge number of customers we receive during boom years is practically unbelievable.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Talents Management start in Lebanon, and how has it evolved since its establishment?<br></h4><p>After starting the radio station Radio One, we began producing creative concepts and managing entertaining events. Talents Management organized the first international tennis tournament to take place in Lebanon after the civil war. Players such as Henry Leconte, who was then ranked seventh in the world, participated. It was not until 1999 that Talents Management developed a large portfolio of talent in sports, music, and other forms of entertainment, but I wanted to launch the company in a spectacular manner. That year Talents Management held an official launch party, with a performance by Guy Manoukian and a 20-minute firework display. Management can start anywhere—from a small operation in a retail store to the Olympic Games, which is one of the largest events in the world. We started collaborating with radio by using below-the-line marketing strategies. Our first company's clients were Procter &amp; Gamble and Nokia. The company grew considerably in size over the years, and we opened our first office abroad in Jordan in 2005, followed by Syria and Saudi Arabia in 2007. Today, we have offices throughout the MENA region including Egypt, Dubai, Qatar, and Kuwait.</p><h4>What is the percentage of international companies you work with?</h4><p>Lebanon is a small country approaching 4 million citizens. Around two-thirds of our customers are international, including Procter &amp; Gamble, British-American Tobacco (BAT), Nokia, LG, Microsoft, Touch, America Life Insurance, and many liquor companies. We operate locally with a global outreach spreading from the Middle East to Europe. We consider this a very large market, especially for major events. For example, we held an event for the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, and it was a very important milestone for our business. It involved destination management and a lesson in Saudi Arabian culture. Many of the women that landed in the Kingdom were not wearing the compulsory hijab, and we had to clarify certain Saudi Arabian laws. Nonetheless, the event was staged flawlessly, and solidified Talents Management's presence in Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Which country is the most important for Talents Management in terms of events?</h4><p>The most important country that we are focusing on currently is Iraq. The risk is very high as is most business being carried out in Baghdad. Iraq has a population of 33 million, but the service industry is non-existent. We have recruited 1,000 employees part-time to carry out marketing for retail in places that are considered safe zones. Furthermore, we are targeting government events. There is huge potential in Iraq as a result of its new, exciting market.</p><h4>What major events do you have planned for the short term in Lebanon?</h4><p>We recently handled the entire rebranding of MTC Touch; from the initial concept to the organization itself. We came up with the concept of lighting up the entire building with colored lasers that changed from red to blue, and the event was broadcast via satellite. It was the kind of project that I thoroughly enjoy; large events are what I consider to be the most fun. We are currently focusing on events such as the Virgin Festival (V-Fest), which takes place all over the globe. We were supposed to stage the event at the end of August, but, because of the current situation, we have postponed it until the summer of 2014. We may also carry out joint projects with Dubai.</p><h4>What sectors are you trying to attract?</h4><p>We organize conferences for Microsoft, the Ministry of Telecommunications, and a number of governmental and semi-governmental events. One sector I am particularly interested in is sports. I used to be a tennis player, and ranked among Lebanon's Top 16 in 1994. Talents Management is pitching for the Arab Games in 2015. It is crucial for us to partner with a foreign-based company focused on sports.</p><h4>What makes Lebanon different from other countries in the entertainment sector?</h4><p>Going back in time to the 1970s and 1980s, Lebanon was the only country in the region that could pull off larger events. The Lebanese have always been exposed to Western events and music, especially from London and Paris. Lebanon has long been used as a platform to launch new ideas and new innovations for the region. We even compete against European countries on a production level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for Agility Lebanon over the past two years?<br></h4><p>In terms of development, the recent economic situation that the country and the region have experienced, as well as the war in Syria, has significantly affected us. The company and the logistics sector as a whole are involved in various industries as clients. They range from food and machinery to heavy industry and pharmaceutical companies; we have highly diversified our logistical operations. Aside from warehousing, we also offer ocean freight, airfreight, and overland transportation services. Land freight has definitely been negatively impacted by the events in Syria over the past two years. And while we have clearance at all borders, ports, and airports, as well as having warehousing and local distribution networks, all of these were affected to some extent. Some transportation modes, such as ocean freight, increased dramatically due to the difficulties experienced with land freight. On the warehousing side, at the beginning of 2013, business volume was somewhat lower than usual, although demand has subsequently increased in 2Q2013. At the beginning of 2013, we signed a 17-year lease contract for a large state-of-the-art warehouse, in a deal valued over $25 million. This was one of our major developments and investments. The space we are talking about has a capacity of around 45,000 cubic meters. Even though our current occupancy rate is 110% of our present capacity, we are the biggest in Lebanon in terms of warehousing and we have increased our capacity by 35%, which is high for a country such as Lebanon. We perceive this as a prudent move given how we perceive our partners and clients in the market. We view our clients as partners.</p><h4>How would you classify your fleet?</h4><p>It is a mix. We have frozen, chilled, and dry vehicles that cover more than 6,000 points of sale in Lebanon. There is basically no area we don't go to, regardless of the client size. We deliver to small market shops as well as to hypermarkets and five-stars hotels.</p><h4>What sectors represent the greatest growth potential for Agility Lebanon?</h4><p>There is definitely always potential in food, which is continuously growing. In contrast, we haven't seen much growth in electronics over the past two years, and we assume more of the same for the near future. This is the feedback that we are receiving both from our clients and the market.</p><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of Lebanon's logistics sector?</h4><p>A major weakness is the lack of proper infrastructure. We also suffer from endemic irregularity. The latter, however, is also the case throughout the region and elsewhere in the world. If the rate is at 5%, it is manageable, but if it is a 105%, it is not acceptable and, unfortunately, this is precisely the case here. Every country has some degree of corruption, but in Lebanon unfortunately you cannot move unless you know somebody, who knows somebody else. We suffer because, as a global company, we have to comply with and cater to all these means, while following the letter of the law ourselves. This means that it sometimes takes us a little longer to deliver than others.</p><h4>What can be done to improve the logistics sector?</h4><p>It must be privatized. Our expectation of what the government can do to help, or support us, is very low. This preference not to count on any government help underpins our success. And while we do meet with the administration, it is merely a political formality, and obligation. Whenever we talk about infrastructure, we look ahead to a more advanced country and compare ourselves to it. We could achieve this, but any progress is indexed to the ministries, government, and corruption levels. Unless someone invests billions of their own money, we cannot get any contracts.</p><h4>What are your most frequent inbound routes?</h4><p>We are largely an import country. For every 100 shipments, we export about five or 10. There is a small percentage of imports that is then re-exported. There is definitely a part of the wine and the food sectors that we export to, as well as small industries. We have many import routes mainly from Italy in this regard. In the EU, the top three countries are Germany, Italy, and France. In Asia, it is China. This is where our focus is: Europe, Asia, and then the US. The rest of the world does feature, but the numbers are smaller.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>In April 2013, I paid a visit to Oman and saw with my own eyes just how strong and prosperous a country it was. It is a country boldly moving forward to consolidate its prominent position in the world market.<br></p><p>Around 250 years earlier, in 1763, Dutch sailor Cornelis Eyks of the Dutch East India Company wrote in his ship's log, “Muscat is considered to be the most powerful of the Arabian principalities." Even in those days, Dutch merchants recognised Muscat as a crossroads of global trade—a crossroads where the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa meet. At the time, the Dutch East India Company was the world's largest trading company. Engaging in trade and searching for new markets is what unites Oman and the Netherlands and drives our economies.</p><p>Since the days of Cornelis Eyks, trade relations between our two countries have grown ever stronger. As early as the 19th century Oman and the Netherlands signed a free trade agreement (FTA). Trade has continued to flourish thanks to the close relationship between Oman and the international port of Rotterdam, the largest port outside of Asia. Its prime geographical location makes Rotterdam the gateway to Europe—and its 500 million consumers—for oil, steel, and consumer goods.</p><div class="quote">“  Sohar's new port is actually a 50-50 joint venture between the Government of Oman and the Port of Rotterdam. "</div><p>Oman, too, has become a major player in its region, growing rapidly into a prominent trading nation. And as the country's seaports and airports expand at an unprecedented rate, Oman is looking to collaborate with experts from abroad—a challenge that a trading nation like the Netherlands, with its logistics knowledge and age-old maritime tradition, is keen to grasp with both hands.</p><p>Because, like Oman, we realise that in these turbulent times our lead could evaporate overnight, we must continue to invest in solid and efficient ports and infrastructure. This is especially important in transit countries like our own, with state-of-the-art multimodal connections to our hinterlands, which are vital to our economies.</p><p>If one thing has become clear in recent decades it is that we cannot go it alone in global trade. Countries like Oman and the Netherlands need to join forces and share knowledge with each other and with their partners around the world. Only then will we be able to stay ahead of the competition.</p><p>That is why I believe strong trade ties with Oman are so important—ties based on a long tradition of friendship and enterprise. And why I am stressing the importance of the Port of Rotterdam's involvement in the development of Oman's ports at Sohar and Duqm. Sohar's new port is actually a 50-50 joint venture between the government of Oman and the Port of Rotterdam, forming the gateway for the Netherlands to the Middle East and the rest of the Asian continent. Through collaboration of this kind, Oman and the Netherlands can maintain and consolidate their already strong position in logistics and supply chains.</p><p>Of course, trade cooperation between the two countries goes beyond logistics and port development. There are many more industries in which economic collaboration can open up new opportunities. Dozens of Dutch companies are already active in Oman, in everything from airport baggage handling, to desert water management, and waste processing, all areas in which the Netherlands is an international leader.</p><p>In 2014 and beyond, I am confident that Oman and the Netherlands will continue to invest in close and flourishing trade relations, just as they did in the 18th century, that not only foster innovation in logistics and supply chains, but also success in other sectors. In this way, Oman and the Netherlands can strengthen each other's economies even further and make our countries and people even more prosperous.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TBY How does Mohsin Haider Darwish (MHD) display its commitment to developing Oman's youth through training and education?<br></h4><p>MHD will be one among the founding promoters of the National Automotive Higher Institute (NAHI) in Oman, and we are going to be a major stakeholder in this new private university. We have an MHD training institute for young Omanis that has been running successfully for several years, and is subsidized by the Ministry of Manpower. We train people as technicians and mechanics, and later take the graduates on as employees or release them into the workforce, depending on our requirements. This is something that is beneficial for all parties; Omanis are trained, the workforce is developed, and we bring through future leaders for MHD. Omanization is not a numbers game; it is a question of building a quality national workforce.</p><h4>What plans do you have to develop your gas division?</h4><p>Our MHG Gases division is one of the largest pioneering industries in Oman. The development of Oman, which has been growing in recent years, is further increasing the demand for industrial gases. This presents a challenge, but we have decided to press ahead with major investment in our facilities and capacity to meet the increasing level of consumption. We have launched a joint venture with ORPIC, Air Liquide, and OMZEST Group to produce nitrogen at the Sohar Petrochemical Complex. This venture has been very successful, so we are considering further expansion plans. MHD Gases markets a wide range of industrial, medical, and fuel gases, and is one of the largest producers of CO2 for the beverage industry. Currently, we are setting up a world-class facility for special and calibration gases at the Sohar Industrial Estate to cater to the growing demands of petrochemical customers. Accredited to ISO 9001 for quality control in operation and ISO 22000 for food safety procedures, MHD Gases complies with the highest level of QHSE requirements in its operations. Having installed and commissioned prestigious projects for a multi-gas network for Oman Dry Dock and the Ministry of Defense, we have gone ahead with the further expansion of our gas distribution outlet at Duqm in order to support SEZAD's new initiative to develop the petrochemical industries in that region.</p><h4>How has government investment in infrastructure supported MHD's workload?</h4><p>Our projects division is showing extremely healthy growth on the back of the huge government investment in infrastructure. With new roads, ports, and two new airports, we supply bulldozers, rollers, forklifts, and other heavy machinery. The government's decision to enforce subcontracting as a part of tender obligations will drive growth for us as SMEs look to us for products and support. As an organization, we are looking into outsourcing certain functions so as to support local SMEs.</p><h4>What is your outlook for Oman's economy in the medium term?</h4><p>I am very optimistic for Oman's economy. We are starting to leverage the unique geographical advantages that we have through the construction of the new port at Duqm, the railway, two expanded international airports, and the revitalized roads network. Oman will undoubtedly become a hub for transshipment and for airlines. The free zones will help this growth, and Duqm, for me, is the key to the future of Oman. Tourism also represents a huge opportunity for the country, as we remain something of a hidden gem. Oman has an excellent vision to develop its niche markets, which are the future. We are a growing nation and we keep reinventing ourselves. The future is rosy; however, job creation is a serious issue that must be addressed. The government is taking this very seriously, which is encouraging, and the focus should be job creation and sustainability through SMEs.</p><p>© The Business Year</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are some of the main characteristics of OHI Group?<br></h4><p>OHI started as a modest business institution over 35 years ago. Through perseverance, teamwork, and patience, the company has grown into what it is today. We are a completely diversified group, operating through a holding company with several subsidiaries and associates. We participate in the construction sector through a joint venture with a UK company. We are also involved in the technology, oil and gas, hospitality, and financial services sectors, among others. The various components contribute to the whole. There is no one company that can be termed as the major contributor. In 2013, our major contributors are the technology, oil and gas, and marine sectors. The government subsidizes the purchase of engines and boats for fishermen, and we sell the most popular supplies: Yamaha engines, boats and accessories, spare parts, and oil. It is a successful business. Hopefully, our technology and oil and gas business will continue to perform strongly alongside hospitality and financial services. That is the advantage of being diversified; if there is a decline in one particular area, another area will be there to prop it up. We have always believed in the importance of being successful in whatever we do. Success to us is not measured purely by financial results—reputational success has always been key.</p><h4>What service provisions do you offer in the IT sector?</h4><p>We are gold partners with Microsoft, Oracle, and Cisco, and have jobs from almost every ministry in this country, as well as an extensive presence in the private sector. The company has partnered with Microsoft in its drive to implement enterprise agreements for the government, for which we have a significant contract. We design software for organizations, and are also involved in structured cabling and the installation of fiber optics. We have the skill set to develop data centers. Our work is predominantly with the public sector, making up perhaps 80% of our overall activity. I believe that the public sector will continue to be the main contributor as government investment continues.</p><h4>How important is forming partnerships in OHI's business model?</h4><p>OHI's tagline is the “Power of Partnership," and this has been crucial throughout our business history. Alliances with companies such as Interserve and G4S may appear to be more visible, but we have numerous other flourishing partnerships that date back over three decades. Our UK joint venture has worked on newly built refineries and power plants, one of which is being built in Sohar. Any project that contributes financially and adds value to the Omani economy is important for us.</p><h4>What do you think about government efforts to encourage SMEs?</h4><p>It is a very good initiative. For SMEs in the construction sector, the government has created a development fund called Al Rafd that could help support development. Given the finite number of jobs that can be created between the public and private sectors, SMEs are a very useful avenue to gainfully employ people. The successful small entrepreneurs of today will take on the larger enterprises tomorrow. This is how a country's economy keeps growing. I am all for the healthy growth of the SME sector. We at OHI are contributing by taking on several such entrepreneurs under our wing and mentoring them.</p><h4>What are the growth areas for OHI?</h4><p>We are an opportunistic group, and see organic growth potential in all the areas that we are already in. We will also look at inorganic growth as and when suitable investment opportunities present themselves. While we are predominantly operating in Oman presently, we have set up companies in Qatar and the UAE to participate in the technology sector there.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the local economy?</h4><p>The economy in the Sultanate of Oman is thriving on the back of attractive hydrocarbon prices and the sustained efforts of the government to improve the infrastructure, as well as diversify the economy by encouraging tourism and manufacturing activities. This combined with our well-established presence in Oman's business sector makes us optimistic about organic and inorganic growth in the coming years. We always strive to generate between 20% and 30% annual growth. Overall, our results in 2013 were better than those in 2012. We feel confident that 2013 is going to be a good year for us.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Oman Arab Bank (OAB) developed in recent years?<br></h4><p>OAB has grown steadily over the years and we now have 62 branches with over 1,000 employees. Due to our prudent approach we have always generated profits for our shareholders. OAB began operations with $6 million in capital and now has $116 million. We have focused on corporate banking and financing industrial projects. We have been involved in financing for roads, hospitals, and schools, as well as many infrastructure projects, and we finance directly through contractors. Most of the roads in Oman today were financed by OAB. We do not finance the government, but always the contractor. We have heavily invested in Sohar Port, where we are financing projects worth over $600 million in total. We are now opening a branch in the industrial zone. We also financed all the companies that are working in Duqm, and we were the first bank to open a branch there. OAB has given loans to the Duqm project totaling over $150 million.</p><h4>What is your strategy for sourcing new project finance contracts?</h4><p>We monitor all contracts being tendered constantly. We go to the Tender Board for the list of all projects and then we contact the potential contractors in order to bid to arrange financing facilities. This ensures that we will arrange the financing facilities, irrespective of which contractor wins the contract. This is imperative because we do not know who the winner will be, but we have to make the contract, even if they are foreign companies. We are very active and utilize Arab Bank branches in foreign countries to contact the headquarters of those companies looking to invest here.</p><h4>What products and services do you offer SMEs?</h4><p>We are one of the few banks nominated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to finance SMEs, with the government securing 50% and the banks taking 50% of the responsibility. We are very active in this field and finance many companies. We now also arrange seminars for small business owners to educate them about financing, managing their projects, and how to run a successful business. There is a need to participate, to educate the people on how to operate businesses, how to manage, how to prepare a balance sheet, and how to analyze their business financially. You have to prove to the bank that you are capable of managing your project, and these seminars will go a long way to help SMEs owners gain access to credit.</p><h4>How important is e-banking for OAB?</h4><p>We concentrate and spend a great deal of money on e-banking. We were the first bank to issue the Smart Card, which is an internal system—not linked to Visa or other major companies—and it was very successful. We started issuing them in 2000, and for the 13 years we have been using it there have been no errors. Nobody can force or misuse this card since it can only be used for the purpose for which it was issued. It is a pre-paid card, but it is very secure and very comfortable. We have collected billions of rials through this. Eventually, the government will have its own internal system using our technology. If anyone pays by Visa, the money takes three days for approval to be given from a different country. With the Smart Card, the money is transferred instantaneously because it is not waiting for approval.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the banking sector in the medium term?</h4><p>I think that because the government is financially comfortable here and extremely capable of spending money on projects, everyone is working. And since oil prices are good, we are making reserves; therefore, there is no problem. The challenge is if the government faces difficulty in financing the projects it announces. If you have a project and a contractor, a company, the bank, and the merchant are all working, then all the sectors are happy. However, if spending falls, everyone loses, including the bank. And, therefore, the banks are doing well so far, and, with political and economic stability, the future looks steady and promising.</p>]]></richbody0content>

He is the eighth direct descendent of the royal Al Busaidi line, founded in 1744 by Imam Ahmed bin Said. He entered the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst at the age of 20, and joined a British Infantry battalion on operations in Germany for one year and also held a staff appointment with the British Army. After his military service, HM Sultan Qaboos studied local government subjects in England and, after a world tour, returned home to Salalah where he studied Islam and the history of his country. Upon his accession to the throne on July 23, 1970, he moved to Muscat, where he declared that the country would no longer be known as Muscat and Oman, but would be united as the Sultanate of Oman.]]></intervieweelist0description>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE, THE MERCIFUL</h4><p>Praise be to Almighty God, who guided us to the path of righteousness and prayer, and peace be upon His Messenger, who called for the application of Shura as an authentic system of governance, as well as his honorable family and his virtuous companions, day and night.</p><p>The experience of Shura in Oman, as we have always stressed, is a successful one. It has been in close harmony with the stages of the Renaissance, and compatible with the values and principles of society, besides being in line with the concept of grooming enlightened individuals, who are well aware of their rights and duties, as well as capable of expressing their opinions and ideas in acceptable language, through sensible logic, and a prudent vision based on a proper assessment of matters. Omanis have, throughout the years, proved that they command a good sense of awareness, culture, insight, and understanding when dealing with various opinions, types of dialogue, and discussions that target the supreme interests of this country and its loyal citizens. We are confident that awareness will increase, and that our culture will grow, and put down strong roots through the roles assigned. The Members of the Council of Oman, through the exchange of views and ideas, stem from a wise tradition that became evident and shall continue to crystallize as we tackle different issues in a deep and elaborate manner of analysis and investigation. We hope that this great edifice, which we have opened in the name of God, will witness a constructive discussion of matters, and a wise tackling of issues. It will also be a discussion through which it becomes clear to anyone who observes this experience, locally and abroad, that Omanis are highly capable of participating with their enlightened opinion and mature thought in decision making that serves their country and promotes it to a prominent place and a noble status. This is no challenge to the people of Oman, a country whose glorious past stands as witness, and whose brilliant present serves as an incentive to look forward to wider horizons of progress and prosperity.</p><p>You are aware that Oman was once in great need of development in all fields, and you understand that in order to achieve the goal of human and social development in all areas of the Sultanate, it has been necessary to establish a solid infrastructure on which development plans and programs are based. This is particularly true in the fields of education, health, training, and employment. Without infrastructure, human and social development would not have reached the population in the cities, towns, villages, plains, and mountains, and in the deep valleys and vast deserts. Previous development plans, despite the widespread area of Oman and its harsh geographical terrain, have gone a long way, which has led to the transformation of life in this country and facilitated the implementation of development programs—both social and humanitarian. It has helped to extend services of all types to citizens wherever they are. The need for infrastructure will never cease because it is an ongoing process necessitated by urban expansion and social and economic development, reaffirmed by the people's need for communication and aspirations for a better, happier life. Therefore, infrastructure development always gains attention at all stages of growth and nation building, without exception. Infrastructure gains extreme importance and is accorded top priority at some of these stages due to special circumstances and specific considerations that call for such action. Therefore, what some people often deem as a greater emphasis on infrastructure than human or social development in the past stages of development is not accurate, as such a view ignores the reality—that is, the conditions that prevailed at that time and the priorities made necessary by the situation there and then. That view also ignores the tremendous attention that was similarly accorded to the areas of education, health, commerce, industry, agriculture, finance, and the economy at large. Thus, the attention accorded to these areas aims at the provision of a dignified life for the citizen, who, as we have always affirmed, is both the target of the comprehensive development and its effective tool. We have instructed our government to focus, in its future plans, on social development, particularly its aspects related to the daily lives of citizens. This should be achieved by the creation of renewable employment opportunities and training programs for citizens and promoting production capacity, as well as scientific, cultural, and intellectual development. We will closely follow the steps taken in this field. This matter shall also be the focus of attention of the Supreme Council for Planning, which seeks to draft well-studied development plans that take into account the priorities of each stage, and the balance between various aspects of development toward attaining the overall goal. It is pleasing and rewarding to see that Oman is progressing in balanced steps in this direction, which we regard as being the right one. We pray to the Almighty to bless us with further success for the sake of Oman and its loyal citizens.</p><div class="quote">“  More attention should be accorded to the requirements imposed by scientific and cultural development toward the evolution of a generation armed with awareness, knowledge, and the abilities required for worthwhile work. "</div><p>The private sector is one of the basic pillars of development, both in the economic concept, which represents commerce, industry, agriculture, tourism, and finance, and the economy in general, as well as the social concept, which denotes human resources development, training, the upgrading of scientific and practical skills, and the offering of new employment opportunities and incentives in the private sector. Some citizens have the misconception that the private sector relies on what the state offers to it, and that it does not contribute efficiently to the service of society and support of its social institutions and programs, or that the private sector seeks only to achieve profit, or does not try to work more seriously in serving its society, environment, and its country. Such an impression could harm not only the future of the private sector, but would also have a negative impact that would extend to the development plans of the country, particularly to the diversification of income. Therefore, the private sector is required to work harder to eliminate this impression, to take well-studied and efficient practical steps, through increasing its contribution to social development, and to work in closer partnership with the government in implementing its policies, hand-in-hand with civil society institutions, which offer social and humanitarian services. Such a positive attitude is capable of enhancing the confidence of citizens and their appreciation of the private sector's role. It will encourage the Omani youth to work in this sector, and to keep their jobs, while instilling a spirit of belonging to the sector's institutions. This will in turn reflect positively on the performance of youth, their commitment to the ethics of work, and will contribute  to productivity. Therefore, the private sector will be an authentic partner in employment and development plans prepared by government departments, and from which the private sector itself benefits. These plans will provide a strong impetus for the development of the private sector's potential, and release its great energy in the fields of local, regional, and international competition. Everyone who has completed their education or training has to take up a useful profession that fulfills their sense of being, and through which they can strive to achieve their ambitions, rather than expect a government job. The state, with all its civil, security, and military institutions, cannot continue to be the main source of employment, as this calls for a capacity beyond its reach and a mission that the state cannot sustain forever. Citizens have to understand that the private sector is the real source of employment in the long run. Hence, they should not hesitate to join it, and must not desert their jobs therein. This, in turn, calls for a revision of the salary system of the private sector, particularly in low- and medium-paid jobs. This has to be considered a national mission that must be accomplished in allegiance to this country; it should also be considered a service to citizens who place their confidence, their efforts, and their mental ability in serving the sector.</p><p>It is well understood that education is the basis of development. This is true at the various stages of education and through its diverse curricula and national manpower, which is necessary for domestic development and for the implementation of programs. Therefore, it has been necessary, for the success of development plans and the execution of programs, to work toward securing the quality of output of all types of educational establishments in accordance with the general policies of the state, to help attain the goals that we all aspire to achieve. During the past few years, various systems of education and curricula have been implemented and different training programs executed. And yet, the matter calls for greater attention to be accorded to linking educational output to the requirements of the labor market. Hence, one of the priorities of the current stages of development, and of the next stage, is to prepare educational policies, plans, and programs for revision. They need to be developed to keep pace with the changes that the country is undergoing. More attention should be accorded to the requirements imposed by scientific and cultural development toward the evolution of a generation armed with awareness, knowledge, and the abilities required for worthwhile work. The establishment of the Education Council seeks to promote this sector. Therefore, all departments in charge of education at all levels have to cooperate with the Council in total dedication and perseverance. We would also like to call upon the Council of Oman to present its opinion in this respect to the Education Council, and we are confident that joint efforts will lead to the desired results.</p><p>Our domestic policy is based on constructive work in serving the public interest, and keeping pace with the developments of the age, while at the same time maintaining our identity, our principles, and our values, in which we take pride. As for our foreign policy, its essence is the call for peace, harmony, and close co-operation with all nations, as well as commitment to the principles of righteousness, justice, fairness, and non-interference in the internal affairs of others, and the resolution of disputes through peaceful means to help safeguard for all mankind its security, stability, prosperity, and progress.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>As maritime trading nations, our early links were based on commerce, with the first trade treaty signed in 1646. Today, the links between our two countries are multi-faceted. HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said has close personal ties to the UK. In 2010, Her Majesty the Queen paid a State Visit to the Sultanate. Their Royal Highnesses, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, visited Oman in March 2013, and His Majesty the Sultan visited the UK in 2012. His Majesty generously sent 112 horses to the UK to take part in the celebrations of Her Majesty's Diamond Jubilee celebration in 2012, the largest contingent of any country.<br></p><p>The UK and Oman are key partners in foreign policy. Oman has a long-established policy of maintaining good relationships with all countries, and the UK greatly respects this position. We work closely with the Omanis on Yemen, where both of our countries want to see the security, economic growth, and prosperity that are the pre-requisites for Yemen's long-term stability. We keep in close touch with Oman about the tragedy unfolding in Syria, and we share the view that a political solution to the current crisis is the only way to bring the conflict to an end. The UK has a healthy trading relationship with Oman. The Sultanate is politically and economically stable, and our financial and political ties mean that the UK is well placed to win business in Oman. There are close ties between the Omani and British education and training sectors, with over 13,000 Omani students studying in the UK over the last three years. Some 20 British higher education institutions already have relationships with Omani counterparts, and specialist-training companies have scored some notable successes over the past two years. There is a continuing appetite for British expertise in these areas.</p><p>There have been some striking trade successes in recent years. In 2012, Ultra Electronics signed a contract for the systems integration at the new Muscat Airport, and BAE Systems agreed with the Omani Ministry of Defense to deliver 12 Typhoon and eight Hawk aircraft in a deal worth £2.5 billion. Carillion built many of Muscat's iconic buildings, including the resplendent Royal Opera House. The UK is, by far, the largest foreign investor in Oman, with some 36% of the total stock of FDI worth $5 billion. Much of this investment is in the oil and gas industry. Shell is the main international partner of Petroleum Development Oman, and we expect that BP will invest heavily in the Khazzan-Makarem gas field in the coming years. The UK financial services industry is well represented in Oman. In 2012, HSBC merged with the Oman International Bank in a deal worth $600 million. As well as HSBC, Standard Chartered and several other British law and accountancy firms have Omani branches. With the establishment of Oman's first two Islamic banks, there are opportunities in particular for British companies with expertise in that area. Areas where British exporters perform strongly include industrial machines, vehicles, power generation equipment, electrical appliances, chemicals, and defense equipment. Looking forward, I hope that, through the UK-Oman Joint Working Group, co-chaired by myself and His Excellency Sayyid Badr Bin Hamad Bin Hamood Al Busaidy, Secretary General at the Omani Foreign Ministry, we can increase cooperation in every field. Working in partnership with the Omani government, the UK can make a key contribution to the Sultanate's economic development. In particular, we want to contribute to the development of SMEs, culture and heritage, education, and trade sectors. It is notable that Omani businesspeople often say they want to see more British companies in the Sultanate. The UK will continue to focus on how it can expand its trade and investment links. Companies such as Shell, BP, HSBC, Carillion, and Ultra Electronics are committed to developing local capabilities through training and educational programs, maximizing the in-country value of their operations and helping the development of Omani SMEs. They see themselves as partners in Oman's economic development. Of UKTI's list of 100 projects designated as “High Value Opportunities," two are Omani: the Oman National Railway Project and the Healthcare Infrastructure Project. Oman has ambitious plans to further develop its transport infrastructure, and to capitalize on its advantageous geographical location.</p><div class="quote">“  The UK is, by far, the largest foreign investor in Oman, with some 36% of the total stock of FDI worth $5 billion.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Croatia is a European country whose geostrategic position, natural resources, and human capital represent a good basis for the development of a society that appreciates work, knowledge, and creativity. Croatia's accession to the EU on July 1, 2013 marked the most important stage in the process of Croatia's political, economic, and social internationalization. We have become part of a market of 500 million people. This is a position that can bring Croatia and its partners outside the EU a significant benefit since this adds the capacities of different markets and creates opportunities that Croatia, realistically speaking, could not have up to now. Now is the right time to use this leeway, together with our friends and partners in the world—Oman certainly being one of them—for the further development and advancement of our relations.<br></p><p>In addition to easier access to the European and global markets, we offer a modern transport infrastructure, safe business environment, encouraging investment climate, educated labor force, and high quality of life.</p><p>Croatian companies have enormous and relevant experience in the construction of infrastructural facilities, which has been confirmed in a number of successfully realized projects worldwide. To all those who have visited Croatia in recent years at least once, it is clear that we have one of the most modern motorway networks in Europe. Croatia's construction industry has proved its expertise in civil engineering and building construction, and I am confident that it can meet the demands of the Omani market.</p><div class="quote">“  Our two countries share good geographic positions, favorable climate, a long seafaring tradition, rich cultural heritage, and an ecological conscience. "</div><p>I am aware that the Omani side has, several times, expressed its interest in the use of Croatia's air and seaports. A project of modernization and development of the port of Rijeka is underway. This includes development of the port's transshipment and commercial facilities, a passenger port, a boating center, and accompanying commercial and tourist facilities. Opportunities for investment are arising as well as for some other ways of using the capacities of the port of Rijeka and its entire transport direction. It is possible to use the benefits of a free zone there.</p><p>In relation to this, it is necessary to refer to Osijek Airport and its opportunities for the development of cargo transport. Here, as well as in other areas, Croatia expects Omani entrepreneurs and Omani capital, with its doors being wide open.</p><p>Croatia can be an interesting partner to Oman in the sector of energy transport and the energy trade. Croatia has plans for the construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal on the island of Krk—Omani investors and suppliers are welcome.</p><p>Our two countries share good geographic positions, favorable climate, a long seafaring tradition, rich cultural heritage, and an ecological conscience; all these elements are integrated in the development of Croatia's tourism sector. To its Omani partners, Croatia offers opportunities for investments in its tourism infrastructure. We remain open for exchanges of experience and know-how, in particular in the area of medical tourism, in which our Omani friends have earlier expressed their interest.</p><p>I am acquainted with Oman's policy of providing its citizens with the opportunity to acquire knowledge abroad. Croatia has quality programs, in particular in the field of medicine and engineering, which are open to foreign students. Personally, I would like if students from Oman were among them. In our previous contacts, Oman expressed its need for experts in archaeology, in particular underwater research. In this sense, still unexplored archaeological sites in Oman represent a major opportunity for cooperation with our archaeological experts.</p><p>During earlier bilateral talks and contacts, we could identify the areas of interest of both countries, ranging from the development of infrastructure, energy, and tourism to cooperation in science and education. Now is the time to identify the concrete projects that we want to develop within these areas. The initiated dialogue between Croatia and Oman can be moved to a new strategic level. All future efforts focused on this will enjoy my full support.</p><p>Finally, I am very pleased that Omani tourists have discovered Croatia and that they visit Croatia in increasing numbers—their visits are appreciated.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does the Ministry of Manpower do to promote employment opportunities in the private sector across Oman?<br></h4><p>We have endorsed employment policies with the aim of achieving a qualitative transformation from relying on the government as a major employer of nationals, to a status where the private sector takes that role. To meet the progress in the labor market and the requirements of the private sector's expansion, the Ministry has endeavored to increase employment opportunities for national job seekers and prepare the Omani youth by providing them with the necessary education and training, helping them develop knowledge and skills, while focusing on the specializations required by the labor market.</p><h4>How does the Ministry encourage the vital role of technical training in the Sultanate?</h4><p>Development has been achieved in terms of the number of technological colleges, expansion in their infrastructure, diversification of their academic studies and programs, and an increase in the numbers of students admitted. These have helped promote this vital sector of the labor market, and the national economy in general. In the academic year 2012-2013, a total of 5,046 students of general education diploma graduates were admitted to technological colleges, with a second batch comprising 6,254 students soon to be admitted, too. Government policies aimed at developing the infrastructure, modernizing labs and workshops, developing human resources, and promoting service utilities have enabled technical colleges to increase their capacities and diversify their academic specializations, according to labor market requirements. Work is also underway to develop a program meant to replace expatriate lecturers and assistant lecturers by Omanis, while at the same time continuing the replacement programs for the posts of technicians and trainers at workshops and labs.</p><h4>How has vocational training developed in Oman?</h4><p>The number of students admitted at the vocational training centers and fishermen training institutes has increased proportionately with expansion. Women were offered great opportunities that enabled them to join appropriate specializations and enhance their participation in the labor market. A bridging system with the Colleges of Technology has been implemented by providing the distinct graduates of these centers and institutes with opportunities to continue their studies at the Colleges of Technology. Efforts are being extended to update the curricula, develop the human cadres of these institutions, coordinate with international think-tanks to conduct feasibility studies, propose training programs to avail them of training expertise, and to hold training courses for trainers at these centers and institutes.</p><h4>What are the Ministry's projections for the expatriate manpower requirement in the medium term?</h4><p>In a speech to Sheikhs and dignitaries of the Governorates of the Dakhiliyah and Wusta on January 27, 2013, HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said proposed that the percentage of expatriate workers should not exceed 30% of the total population. In light of this Royal directive, the Ministry works toward striking a balance in the market to meet the actual need of the private sector's projects, in order to ensure its contribution to GDP development.</p><h4>What is the Ministry's vision for the future development of Oman's labor market?</h4><p>The Oman Vision 2020 is based on three key pillars: human resources development, economic diversification, and development of the private sector to strike a balance and achieve sustainable economic growth. To encounter the challenges of globalization, international trade liberalization, and the requirements of the market economy and to apply international standards in the labor market, the basic goals of the previous and current development plans include: expansion in providing job seekers with job opportunities, the qualitative preparation of national manpower by offering Omani youth the required training and education opportunities.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[forerunner-for-sukuk]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Al Madina Financial &amp; Investment Services developed?<br></h4><p>Al Madina was founded in 1998 as a purely investment company. We used to invest worldwide, in the US and Asia, until September 11, 2001. We then decided to concentrate on the region, and build a real investment-banking house. By building the company from 2001 until today, we have managed to structure and promote private equity companies, real estate funds, and lately structured the first Islamic sukuk in Oman. In 2005, we structured and promoted Al Madina Real Estate as the first publically closed dedicated real estate development company in Oman. There were development companies here before, but they were all family businesses. In 2006, we founded Al Madina Insurance, as well as a logistics company and a hotel. Since 2005, we have promoted more than $250 million worth of investment in the market, locally and in the region. The range of investors in the companies we have promoted varies from institutional/government to private sector entities from Oman and the region. Right now, we are concentrating on different sectors. One of the sectors we are looking at is education and health. In 2012, we signed a joint venture with a Canadian offshore company to start an education company. The Canadian system is one of the top-10 placed education systems in the world. Al Madina is the first and only company right now that has come up with a real estate fund listed on the market, which matured in 2012. We managed to generate 126% IRR for our clients and unit holders. We promised that we would generate 16% IRR, and we managed to raise 21% every year.</p><h4>How would you characterize your investment portfolio?</h4><p>It is a well-balanced portfolio. We have managed to develop a mixed portfolio in different markets and in different sectors. We did not concentrate only on the equity market, but also structured private equity companies and invested in them as a partner with the other shareholders. Our fundamental philosophy is to be in a long-term relationship with our partners to build companies that will add value to the real economy.</p><h4>What do you make of the potential for sukuk issuances in Oman's capital markets?</h4><p>In November 2012, we were awarded a mandate to structure the first Omani sukuk. It was an OMR50 million sukuk with a five-year holding period, a coupon rate of 5%, and a BBB+ rating. The sukuk is structured as an ijara sukuk. We recently received sharia advisory approval for the structure. I think sukuk, as a new instrument, will add value and depth to the capital markets. If you look at Islamic banking and the window, you'll see equity of OMR550 million. That needs to be deployed, and you are looking at more than OMR5 billion. Many instruments need to be developed, and sukuk is one such example.</p><h4>Do you feel enough is being done to increase awareness of Islamic finance?</h4><p>Efforts need to go further to increase awareness. What has been done is sufficient for the meantime; however, more needs to be done. We are a Muslim country and people are hungry and keen to learn more. I know some newspapers have a plan to run a three-month educational plan for the public. Any awareness campaign that institutions get involved in should not be used to market products. It should be a collective effort to take awareness to the people to build the knowledge base of Islamic finance. The market is huge.</p><h4>What are the defining trends on the Muscat Securities Market (MSM)?</h4><p>The problem for the MSM is liquidity, and as members of the industry it is part of our responsibility to come up with ideas and innovations to create liquidity for the market. We understand all the companies, so we need to find ways and means to come up with the real assets and get depth into the market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Could you describe the evolution of the Oman Gas Company (OGC) since 2005?<br></h4><p>The company was established in 2000, when it took over the pipeline transportation business from PDO at that time. The pipelines were about 900 kilometers long and we had a handful of gas consumers at that time. As of today, we have 43 gas consumer points in the country. We have almost tripled our pipeline length, added three compression stations on the pipelines, and are still expanding the pipeline network. OGC has evolved from a gas transportation company to a more complex gas transportation and gas value chain focus. Our largest consumer, sector-wise, is power and water. Second comes industry, and that consists of large industrial users, like the methanol, fertilizer, steel, cement, and refinery sectors, and then a large percentage of our gas goes to oil operations.</p><h4>From where is your gas sourced?</h4><p>We get our gas from four producers currently: PDO Block 6, which accounts for about 70% of gas production, and then the other 30% comes from Oxy's Safah field, PTTEP, and the Dolphin Gas import project. On average, we import about 5.5 million cubic meters per day from Dolphin, which is approximately 12% of our total supply. It is important that you do not depend on one gas supplier, especially in a country like Oman, where we are heavily reliant on gas, and our gas network is quite diversified geographically. We have been dependent not only upon Dolphin Gas, but other producers like PTTEP and Oxy, especially if we have significant gas interruptions from other producers. The Dolphin connection is the first cross-GCC connection, and now we are importing Qatari gas through the UAE. That is the type of good cooperation we would like to see, especially when you talk about gas networks, electricity networks, and other forms of cooperation.</p><h4>Do you provide any consultancy services for companies looking to explore for gas in Oman?</h4><p>We do and we help them. We have been providing some consultancy services, especially for the newcomers to Oman, helping them to understand the gas infrastructure, the business, and the opportunities, where to tie in their plants and pipelines, and sometimes we help them on the pipeline design itself. We also provide feedback on where we can optimize the gas value chain in the country. We have a strong relationship with the Ministry of Oil and Gas, and we advise its officials and they consult us on gas-related issues. We also consult them on gas value opportunities, which has been successful, and we now have projects in the pipeline.</p><h4>How do you envisage gas prices changing in the coming years?</h4><p>The price has already changed for major consumers, and the country has to follow the international trend. However, for new industries, the government has put in place a different set of gas prices, and that is in line with international trends. Of course, the rise of unconventional or tight gas will mean our supply will cost much more. If we go more unconventional, and drill deeper, then we perhaps will need fracking technology and the price will go up.</p><h4>How will the Duqm development affect OGC?</h4><p>We are gearing up for it. We are building the largest capacity pipeline in OGC down to Duqm, just to be ready for the development. We are quite busy on the Duqm pipeline now and I hope we will be the first main infrastructure to arrive there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the history of ACWA Power Barka's operations in Oman?</h4><p>Our plant's capacity is 427 MW and it produces 20 million gallons of potable water per day. Our contract is for 15 years, and the term will end in April 2018. The power generated and water produced by ACWA Power Barka is delivered to the government network for further distribution across the nation as required. ACWA Power is very ambitious and signed an extension of the existing water plant with the government in 2013. Due to the shortage of water in Oman, we offered our assistance to build a reverse osmosis desalination plant with a capacity of 10 million gallons per day, which is under construction and will be completed in 4Q2013. This project is innovative because we are using the synergies of our existing plant, which includes the provision of power to this new plant. With the construction of this new extension to the plant, the company will have implemented a hybrid solution of both multi-stage flash and reverse osmosis desalination technology, which is the first of its kind in the world. No one has ever constructed hybrid plants on such a large scale, so we have added value to the company and the nation. The capacity of the new expansion project is 10 million gallons, bringing our total capacity to 30 million gallons per day. This is expected to complement the growth in demand in Oman for water, which has risen drastically since 2012 at between 12% and 16%.</p><h4>What is the reason for the dramatic rise in demand for water?</h4><p>The rapid growth of the economy and the budget, which rose by 8% in 2013, has driven demand in Oman. This activity has also sparked the development of new projects in domestic housing, commercial loads, and some industrial loads as well. These are the two main reasons behind the rapid growth in demand for water and electricity.</p><h4>Is there room to expand production?</h4><p>We are contractually bound and cannot change our production levels; however, we have the ability to produce more. During 2012, we produced 15 MW of extra energy using the excess power from our gas turbines. In the future, we will be utilizing this excess power for the expansion project, which will assist the government in meeting water demand. The water expansion is a very important development project. We have saved a large amount of money by utilizing the reject water from our existing desalination units, meaning we have avoided building a huge intake system to take water from the sea to the plant. In fact, we have saved almost 30% more than any other desalination plant and we offered the government a very attractive tariff, which is also adding value. We are very ambitious; we want to expand ACWA Power and the company will be participating in future government projects.</p><div class="quote">“  Many companies are getting power from gas stations, which is much cheaper than solar energy. "</div><h4>Could you tell us more about your relationship with the rest of ACWA Power?</h4><p>ACWA Power owns 58% of our business. As the major shareholders, most of our staff here are from ACWA, and our main focus  is on its activities. I am both the ACWA Business Development Manager and the Country Manager for ACWA Power; our ultimate goal is to provide added value to our shareholders and our parent company by coming up with such innovative ideas to assist the government to meet both vital commodities rapid demand and add value to our business.</p><h4>Will you introduce Oman to the renewable energy technology ACWA has developed?</h4><p>Yes, of course. Our medium-term aim at ACWA Power is to produce 15% of the total power generated from renewables. Oman requires these kinds of initiatives, which will push other companies to install alternative energy units and enhance the competition between all developers aiming to bring the tariff price near to gas-fired plants. As this is not yet a mature industry, many companies are getting power from gas stations, which is much cheaper than solar energy. Solar energy costs about $30 to $40 per MW per hour. In that sense, we have been very competitive and have offered the Moroccan government $0.19 per kWh, which is very competitive. Gas and power in Oman are subsidized. We have explained to the government that if they lift the subsidy and calculate the entire cost of power produced, the savings would be huge with solar. Renewables are the way forward, and I am a strong believer in their use; I think it is a good technology and the increased expertise in recent years has brought costs down. However, there needs to be more competition in the country, each with supply targets that need to be met. The government certainly needs to come up with a strategy to target the use of this clean and sustainable energy.</p><h4>What will network interconnection among the GCC do for Oman's energy security?</h4><p>Interaction between the Gulf countries will create and strengthen the security of electricity, and we have experienced this already. For example, we suffered power shortages in 2012 when Oman imported power from the GCC grid. Interconnection is the ultimate solution to prevent internal disturbance in power and inhibit the collapse of the entire grid, while providing adequate system stability. During peak hours in the summer, if one of the power plants trips and there is a lack of spinning reserve, it is necessary to secure imports. Therefore, more cooperation would dramatically improve the security of the grid. The idea is to solidify electricity transfer by interconnecting the GCC network with the European network through Turkey, and then we can import and export power. There are some technical difficulties to overcome with regard to this strategy, but nevertheless, it would be an ideal situation. Interconnected power will definitely boost the security of the system.</p><h4>How would you assess the success of the government's privatization program in the past decade?</h4><p>Oman officially started privatization in 2005, when the transfer scheme was carried out. We have seen a major change in the power industry in terms of deregulation, and the entire sector has become more regulated. The administration has created more platforms for competition in terms of generating power and brought more regulation that encourages foreign investment. Another significant achievement was the reduction of major government expenditures. The situation is ideal because privatization helped the government meet the country's demand and supported the country's economy by reducing expenditures. Now, Oman is more efficient and benefits from more expertise in the country, particularly in terms of the foreign companies that follow their own standards, regulations, and targets, which is an added value. Overall, privatization has also benefited local investments, because as in ACWA Power Barka's case, we are required to provide the public with 35% of our shares. This benefits the nation, the people, small and medium investors, and even large investors. The government pension fund is one of our major investors.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the performance of Oman's banking sector in 2012?<br></h4><p>Overall, 2012 was the best yet for the local banking sector. The banks have been very resilient and well capitalized, far beyond the 12% we specified for our banks and outlined by the Basel committee criteria, which requires a capital adequacy level of 8%. Our banking sector is capitalized between 16% and 20%. The banks have been very profitable, with profits rising by 15.6% in 2012. We expect the banking sector will grow in 2013 and continue to record strong results. The government is spending a lot of money on infrastructure projects, and I believe the banking sector will be the main beneficiary. There is also a growing number of Omanis joining the labor workforce, and many will need personal finance. It is expected that Islamic banks will complement the current conventional banking in promoting growth in the economy, diversifying banking services, and augmenting financial inclusion. I am very optimistic that the banking system will do better in 2013. The non-performing loan (NPL) ratio is very low, at around 2%. The economy is growing, driven by project finance, and the banking sector will grow with it.</p><h4>How does the trend of rapidly rising aggregate deposits in the banking sector reflect the health of the industry?</h4><p>Commercial bank deposits and credit registered significant growth over the year, as the banking system engaged in its financial intermediation role. Aggregate deposits held with commercial banks increased from OMR8.67 billion in 2008 to OMR12.57 billion in 2011, and further to OMR14.17 billion at the end of 2012. Private sector deposits, which accounted for 64% of total deposits, rose by 12.3% during 2012. In private sector deposits, the growth was broad based with savings, demand, and time deposits increasing by 17.2%, 13.3%, and 7.4%, respectively. With government expenditure playing a significant role in overall GDP growth, the deposit growth in the banking sector is expected to remain buoyant.</p><h4>What initiatives does the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) have to promote awareness of Islamic finance options?</h4><p>We started an Islamic banking awareness campaign in May 2011, when we got directives from the government that Islamic banking was to be introduced in the country. Since then, we started a campaign to talk to the press and hold conferences and seminars as well as training sessions for our staff and the banking community to teach this new concept. Islamic banking is well spread globally, but it is new for Oman, and we have been working very hard on all fronts to educate people. We are the regulator, but when it comes to marketing, it is down to the banks themselves to sell their products. We will have six windows and two fully fledged banks by the end of 2013. We feel this number is sufficient to cover the demand for Islamic banking in the country and to promote awareness. Awareness will spread when people do the banking themselves. They will visit the banks and the windows, learning exactly which products are being marketed.</p><div class="quote">“  The government gives tax exemptions on important projects for five years, and these are extendable to up to 10 years. "</div><h4>What share of the market do you expect Islamic finance to capture in coming years?</h4><p>I expect it to be between 10% and 15%, which is a good percentage. The balance sheets of the banks will also grow in line with these figures at 15%-20%. Two new local banks, Bank Nizwa, and alizz Islamic Bank, have been granted approval, with the former commencing operations in December 2012, and the latter in 4Q2013. Almost all local banks have demonstrated interest in establishing windows for Islamic banking, with four of them already operational. Oman offers a large potential for the growth of Islamic banking, opening up new segments and players both from local banks and investors from abroad, thus providing opportunities for new foreign investments. The banks are optimistic that they will be in a position to significantly increase business and this will be positive for the economy as a whole. Islamic banking is expected to complement conventional banking in promoting development in the economy. In a competitive environment, the borrowers should get the benefit of choosing between both conventional and Islamic banking products. Innovative, asset-based financing such as sukuk provide immense opportunities. This will enhance product diversification in the banking system.</p><h4>What opportunities does the strength of Oman's macroeconomic indicators provide for encouraging FDI?</h4><p>The government offers many incentives for FDI. It is spending on developing infrastructure and free zone industrial areas. There is political stability in the country, the economy is growing, and we have oil and gas. All of our investment rules, regulations, and laws are tailored to attract foreign investment to the country. The government gives tax exemptions on important projects for five years, and these are extendable to up to 10 years. We have no personal income tax here, and no restrictions on the inflow or outflow of capital. We have a currency that is pegged to the US dollar, so we have no foreign currency exchange risk. All of this will attract FDI. To date, we have achieved good results. We are building new ports and airports, as well as our Duqm project, which will be the future for Oman. It will be the gateway for all of the Middle East and the GCC. I am very positive and optimistic that we will be getting more and more FDI into our country. With all of this FDI, the infrastructure megaprojects, and the development of our tourism industry, I believe we will be able to meet the challenge of providing employment opportunities for Oman's population.</p><h4>How does Oman's government promote economic resilience to oil price volatility?</h4><p>It is misleading to suggest that a hydrocarbons-based economy, such as Oman, cannot be affected by oil price volatility. As a matter of policy, the Sultanate takes a number of precautionary measures and builds safeguards in the form of reserve funds that have proven to be effective in fending off adverse effects on the economy during times of low crude oil prices. More importantly, the government uses conservative crude oil price assumptions as part of its budget buildup, which has resulted in overall fiscal surpluses in recent years. The realized fiscal surpluses are often transferred to various reserve funds or used to finance the subsequent year's budget. As a developing economy that enjoys a strong fiscal position, it is only natural for the Sultanate's government to pursue an expansionary fiscal policy that is geared toward developing new infrastructure and modernizing the existing setup. Failure to use government revenues for this endeavor would constitute a lost opportunity, in particular given the importance of infrastructure in both domestic and foreign investments and promoting overall economic growth.</p><h4>What initiatives does the CBO have to promote the SME sector in Oman?</h4><p>The Sultanate's government is fully aware of the need to develop the SME sector as part of its integral economy. In recent years, it has taken a number of measures to develop the required infrastructure and devise the necessary policies. The strategic importance of SMEs in the government's plans is captured by an array of initiatives to promote, sustain, and make this sector competitive. The objective is to develop the sector in a manner that provides more job opportunities besides expanding it as an important source of income for startups and existing entrepreneurs. As far as the CBO is concerned, we encourage the banking sector to lend to the SME sector. Recently, it has been announced that banks should allocate 5% of their total credit to SMEs, and this target should be achieved by December 2014.</p><h4>What is the CBO's vision for the future of the local banking sector?</h4><p>The Omani banking sector continues to depict optimism and resilience, consistent with the sustained growth of the real economy. The banking system remains sound due to the appropriate regulatory and supervisory policies adopted by the CBO. Oman's banking sector comprises 16 commercial banks, two specialized banks, and one operational fully fledged Islamic bank. Healthy competition among banks strengthens the financial system and benefits the population at large with a larger reach in terms of products and services.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>The Middle East is vital for Brazilian foreign policy. We seek partnerships that are fruitful for all. One can identify this goal in Oman, the largest recipient of Brazilian direct investments in that region. For instance, investments of the industrial complex of Vale in the city of Sohar alone amount to $2 billion. This project gathers economic and social development, creating the expectation that other sectors may follow suit.<br></p><p>During my trip to Oman in Spring 2013, there was a great Omani interest in Brazilian investments. On that occasion, we signed the first bilateral agreements to enhance the relations between our countries. We established the Joint Committee, which has begun to set an agenda for cooperation. HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, Head of State and Government of Oman, expressed his wish for a larger Brazilian presence in Oman. As a consequence, we will receive an Omani delegation by the end of 2013 to promote new meetings between entrepreneurs in order to establish partnerships.</p><p>I consider that the performance of Brazil abroad is conspicuous by our search for mutual development, with broad benefits for all those involved. We are committed to social and environmental responsibility. The most prominent evidence of these elements is the iron ore plant by Vale in Sohar, in northern Oman, which processes iron ore for distribution in the steel industry in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East itself. The company built a deep-water port capable of receiving the largest container ships in the world. The capacity to receive 9 million tons of steel can be doubled if necessary. And the management model of Vale is remarkable. Besides having been associated with an Omani company to operate in that country, the integrative action between the two cultures is noticeable. This occurs, for example, in staff: out of the 1,200 workers, only 60 (5%) are Brazilian, whereas the majority is comprised of 780 Omanis (65%) and 360 workers of other nationalities (30%). All of them, without exception, are trained to work in the best way possible. Therefore, they attend training courses in Brazil and Japan, where the technology used in the industrial complex was developed. In addition, in order to improve the lives of people in the region, an agreement between Sultan Qaboos University and the University of Viçosa to study local diseases was signed. The results of this work will not be restricted to the company or its employees, being extended to all of Oman's society.</p><div class="quote">“  In Oman, I found not only great opportunities, but also a welcoming nation with ancient traditions and lush landscapes. "</div><p>The Sohar complex is a model for new experiences. Therefore, in my delegation to Oman, I took Brazilian businessmen from the sectors of aircraft, construction, mining, food, defense, and electrical and electronics industry. Our entrepreneurs have greatly appreciated the idea of a warehouse in Oman for the distribution of products to the markets of Asia and Africa. One of the outcomes of that visit was the creation of a business council consisting of members of the Arab Brazilian Chamber of Commerce (CCAB) and the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry in addition to numerous possibilities of cooperation that resulted from these meetings.</p><p>In Oman, I found not only great opportunities, but also a welcoming nation with ancient traditions and lush landscapes. In addition, I received great hospitality from HM Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said as well as from the Deputy Prime Minister, Sayyid Fahed Bin Mahmood Al Said, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf Bin Alawi Bin Abdullah, and other ministers and diplomatic staff. That hospitality left us the wish—and at the same time the challenge—to return such a reception. We want to host Omani authorities and delegations and also go back to Oman to increase the integration between our two countries.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Raising Oman's competitiveness and productivity is at the heart of what the Public Authority for Investment Promotion &amp; Export Development (PAIPED) does. Boosting productivity is a matter of creating better links between education and industry and between technology and work. Indeed, we recognize that our prosperity depends on the wellbeing of our private sector. As part of the government's Vision 2020, we aim to create sustainable development and a macroeconomic framework that empowers the business community and develops our human resources capacity. We've made significant progress in this area, and here I should like to highlight the outstanding and important work that is being carried out in specific sectors. The Public Establishment for Industrial Estates (PEIE), the umbrella organization for the management of industrial parks in Oman, introduced a long-term strategy for 2011-2025, which plans to add a total of 133 million sqm of new land to its current industrial estates. The goal is to make the private sector the engine of growth for Oman's economy, and we at PAIPED are helping PEIE to attract foreign participation to meet that end. In the coming period, PEIE intends to invest over $180 million in large-scale extensions at industrial zones, which will provide more than 500 new plots to investors. Growth has surged in recent years, with total investment in industrial estates reaching $9.4 billion in 2011. Geography has proved to be a useful ally, as Oman is situated close to international trade routes. Opportunities as a global transshipment hub have been identified, and two of the most successful diversification projects of Vision 2020 have been the development of seaports. Today, Salalah Container Port competes with Abu Dhabi as the premier regional container hub. Our position as a trade hub has been exploited further by the establishment of free zones adjacent to the ports of Salalah and Sohar. So far, the zones have collectively attracted $3.5 billion in investment.<br></p><p>The 1,700-square-kilometer special economic zone (SEZ) at Duqm is another significant initiative for Oman and, with world-class infrastructure, we expect it to have a significant impact on our efforts to diversify Oman's economy in line with Vision 2020. According to the zone's master plan, there are numerous investment opportunities in Duqm, and over the next five years we expect it to receive between $6 billion and $8 billion of direct investment. The area around Duqm is also mineral rich with vast limestone, gypsum, salt, and dolomite deposits—this offers the possibility of it becoming a focus for mining and other associated industries. Given the work of the SEZ at Duqm, PEIE, and Oman's industrial base, the Sultanate's logistics and supply chain sector continues to grow and benefit from significant investment in infrastructure, warehousing, and transportation. The growth prospects and job opportunities in this positive sector are considerable as Oman seeks to take advantage of its strategic location outside the Strait of Hormuz and in close proximity to major shipping routes.</p><p>And you may ask what's driving Oman's logistic sector? The proposed GCC railway network will open up new, efficient, and cost-effective transport routes into the GCC market. The development of the railway network will be a game changer for Oman's logistics industry. The proposed GCC Customs Union, which is scheduled to happen in 2015, will be vital to allow the free movement of goods within the GCC. The continuing development of Oman's ports, roads, and airports are constantly increasing Oman's logistics efficiency and capabilities. Following on from the development of the industrial port at Sohar and the adjoining free zone, we see a significant and increasing demand for warehousing, particularly as freight traffic is pushed up from Port Sultan Qaboos and the free zone develops. The Port of Salalah has developed rapidly to become a major global transshipment hub, with the focus now shifting to further development of the neighboring free zone. The development of Duqm as a new industrial port and city is still in its nascent stages. However, we fully expect large-scale logistics facilities demand and development in Duqm over the coming years. The current development of Muscat International Airport includes increasing the freight handling capacity from 100,000 to 260,000 tons per year. These projects clearly demonstrate the significant potential for Oman's logistics sector.</p><div class="quote">“  As part of the government's Vision 2020, we aim to create sustainable development and a macroeconomic framework that empowers the business community and develops our human resources capacity. "</div><p>Looking at tourism, the Ministry of Tourism predicts that more than 2,000 resort and hotel rooms will have been added in the 2012-13 period. The capital, Muscat, will experience maximum growth with nearly 726 new rooms, and there is an even spread of investment across the rest of Oman with niche resorts opening in Salalah, Khasab, and the Hajar Mountains. We are seeing strong investor demand in the tourism sector, especially in niche properties. This is a result of government-sponsored joint ventures through Oman and other private players. Overall, our approach is to ensure that five-star developments are located in natural landscapes. This approach gives us a competitive edge and fuels investment demand. Additional room supply also generates demand for improved products, with a recent example being the opening of Almouj Golf, a Greg Norman signature 18-hole golf course at The Wave, Muscat.</p><p>Significant investment commitment has been made in regional areas, such as Duqm, where three new hotels with a total of 391 rooms will be opened. Duqm City Hotel, Oman's first pre-fabricated 120-room business hotel opened mid-2012 and Crowne Plaza Duqm is now open for business and will host the Muscat Youth Summit in December 2013. There has also been huge interest in Oman's high altitude Hajar Mountains, where both government and private sector investment are on the rise. In response to the increasing number of tourists, three major resorts in Jebel Akhdar have been invested in. This is in addition to the Sunrise Resort on Jebel Asarh near Jebel Shams, which opened in early 2012. Property group Muriya opened its Sifawy Boutique Hotel at Jebel Sifah, 50 kilometers east of Muscat, in early 2012. Its Juweira Boutique Hotel at Salalah Beach opened mid-year. And this year we will see more hotels opening at Jebel Sifah and Salalah Beach.</p><p>Oman's entry into the global business and meetings market will also accelerate with the opening of the $400 million Oman Convention and Exhibition Centre (OCEC) in 2015. The OCEC project comprises a 3,000 seat plenary hall, 40,000 sqm of exhibition space, a business center, and four hotels totaling 1,000 rooms. Moreover, the re-development of Port Sultan Qaboos as a cruise-liner facility will have a major economic impact on both Muttrah and Muscat.</p><p>Fueling Oman's tourism, industrial, and logistics sectors is government spending in infrastructure. The government implemented 12 new projects from its Eighth Five-Year Plan at a total cost of $4.23 billion in 2012. These will add to the on-going Five-Year Plan projects, currently totaling $17.9 billion in value. Projects include the construction of the $2.59 billion Al Batinah Expressway and the Sur-Bidbid and Mahdha-Al Rawda dual carriageways. It is also important to mention the road-link project between Oman and Saudi Arabia. The road will pass through the Empty Quarter, one of the largest deserts in the world, and will facilitate trade between the two countries as well as pave the way for the economic development of the Dhahirah region.</p><p>The planned $16 billion railway project will also boost Oman's economic growth and sustainable development at the national and regional level and enhance economic integration, while also facilitating trade. The total length of the railway project in the Sultanate will be approximately 1,061 kilometers, extending from the line that connects the wilayat of Al Buraimi and Al Ain in the UAE to the wilayat of Sohar (136 kilometers), Sohar to the Muscat Governorate (242 kilometers), and Muscat to the wilayat of Duqm (486 kilometers). To ensure better connections with airports, ports, and power plants, the project will also include a number of sub branches in Al Buraimi (27 kilometers) to Sohar Industrial Port (8 kilometers), the central train station in Muscat near Muscat International Airport (20 kilometers), and the wilayat of Ibra (84 kilometers).</p><p>The railway line has been designed to carry passenger trains running at speeds of 200 kilometers per hour, and between 80 kilometers to 120 kilometers per hour for cargo trains.</p><p>With 3,165 kilometers of pristine coastline and a deep drop-off ocean shelf, Oman is a prime candidate for aquaculture. In recent years, the Omani government has expressed a desire to grow aquaculture operations, both as a means of diversifying the national economy and as a way to ensure domestic food security needs. The Omani aquaculture sector offers an array of potential opportunities for investors. Musandum and the Al Batinah, in particular, offer maximum potential.</p><p>Spearheaded by the Information Technology Authority, the use of IT to make government more responsible and in the process empower the citizens of our growing nation to make more of their lives is imperative. And, by 2015, we aim to move all government services online.</p><p>We believe that a government that is excelling in IT services is more productive, competitive, and efficient. Indeed, in recent years, the government has taken steps to make Oman an attractive place for high-tech businesses and innovation. In 2003, we opened Knowledge Oasis Muscat, a 68-hectare technology park that is today home to IT businesses from the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and North America. We are conscious that investors need certainty and transparency and Oman offers that. And my organization is busy working with international investors and businesses to ensure we can deliver on our plans and attract the right investment. I encourage prospective investors to make contact with PAIPED, and work with us to build new partnerships and support shared ambitions. By working together, we can seize the opportunities for mutual growth.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have diplomatic efforts advanced relations between Oman and Tanzania?<br></h4><p>The relationship Tanzania enjoys with Oman is unique. The strength and depth of this bond are borne out in the constant links connecting huge swathes of the populations of both nations. Many people in Oman speak Swahili, for example. We visited a museum in Oman recently, and we met someone from Tanzania who had migrated years ago; today, he is one of the top marine biologists in Oman. There are so many people who you can meet in the streets that are receptive and welcoming to Tanzanians. Endowed with this unique cultural anchor, we are working to build upon political and economic relationships. A number of investors have been making contributions to the Tanzanian economy. We also sell cattle and beef to Oman, and we hope to see this kind of trade grow.</p><h4>How will the establishment of the Omani-Tanzanian Joint Economic Committee support that relationship?</h4><p>We meet regularly with Oman to discuss areas of cooperation and exchange. It is a country with which we want to develop very close relations, and I feel the obligation to do so given the diaspora of Tanzanians and Tanzanian culture in Oman. It is a truly unique connection.</p><h4>In which sectors do you see the most opportunity?</h4><p>I see huge potential in oil and gas particularly, but Oman has many strengths. The country also has surplus capital and is constantly seeking lucrative investment areas. Tanzania has such opportunities in abundance and we are seeking to enhance economic cooperation. We are also evaluating trade relations; Oman has a huge consumer market that we believe Tanzania can take advantage of. We can create manufacturing capacity here and offer agriculture and livestock supplies that can be integrated into the market in Oman.</p><div class="quote">“  We meet regularly with Oman to discuss areas of cooperation and exchange.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years, Oman has benefited from high oil prices and increased production, which has allowed for stepped-up government spending on public investment projects. This, in turn, has helped spur growth in the non-oil sector, most notably manufacturing and tourism. However, the evolution of the tradable sector beyond the oil sector has been slow, and the country's export composition is still dominated by oil and gas. Recent spending initiatives are putting pressure on the government's budget and medium-term fiscal sustainability. These challenges point to the need for the government to build buffers and continue to promote job-creating, non-oil growth, especially in the light of dwindling oil reserves. To be sure, the Omani economy continued to grow in 2012, with our projections indicating overall GDP growth having reached 5%, up from 4.5% in 2011. Due to new recovery technology and investment prompted by high oil prices, oil production is estimated to have increased. Non-oil sector growth is projected at 5.8% in 2012, supported by public investment and increased activity in the services sector. Near- and medium-term growth prospects remain positive. The recent spending initiatives, including government job creation in 2011-2012, increased expenditures by 70% between 2010 and 2012. As a result, the government's policy space to respond to shocks has been diminished. A sustained drop in oil prices could exhaust available buffers and necessitate borrowing to maintain projected capital spending. If the government continues to spend at the same rate as during the past few years, it will begin to run fiscal deficits after 2015, which would force it to draw on its past savings, borrow, or cut its investment program. The latter would have an adverse impact on growth prospects. Moreover, Oman's short horizon of proven oil reserves—projected to last less than 20 years according to international agency estimates—gives urgency to the need to rein in spending. It is crucial, however, that this be achieved in a growth-friendly manner. To that end, containing current spending while maintaining capital spending would help create the fiscal space needed for implementing the government's planned public investment and help mitigate the negative impact on growth. A priority will be to reduce subsidies, particularly on fuel prices, that disproportionately benefit the well off. A gradual alignment with international fuel prices, while ensuring targeted support to protect the poor, would leave more public resources for other priority spending, such as investment in infrastructure that will help generate jobs and growth. Given that energy subsidy reform is complex, both technically and politically, careful planning, including on the timing and pace of reform, is crucial. Another key ingredient for successful subsidy reform is a communications campaign that raises awareness about the cost of subsidies and the benefits of reform, and helps generate broad political and public support. Creating job opportunities for the Omani workforce in the private sector is a top priority for the government. More efforts are needed, however, to alter the preference of Omanis to work in the private sector. A determined effort to foster SMEs will go a long way to deepen economic diversification and create employment. Recent government initiatives, such as providing entrepreneurs with access to finance through the Oman Development Bank, will help give the sector a much-needed boost, as will the development fund to target college and university students seeking to set up businesses. High oil prices provide Oman with the opportunity to boost fiscal buffers and build on progress already made to promote non-oil growth. Diversification into areas with greater employment potential is a key tenet of Vision 2020.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is the composition of your portfolio?<br></h4><p>We have around OMR100 million under management in public equity portfolios and funds. In 2013, we launched the first sharia-compliant fund in Oman, called Al Khair GCC Fund, which has been well received in the region. We are in the process of setting up two new divisions: one for private equity and the other division focuses on real estate investment opportunities.</p><h4>Could you highlight the recent track record of the funds managed by Vision?</h4><p>In terms of equity mutual funds, Vision's Emerging Oman Fund has been rated as the best Oman equity fund in the region, and our Vision Emerging GCC fund was ranked number two in the region among all the funds for 2012 by Zawya Ranking System, a leading financial online portal that is part of Thomson Reuters. The fact that our funds and portfolios have consistently outperformed benchmark indices even in poor market conditions speaks volumes for our regional reputation. In fact, in 2011 S&amp;P wrote that we were very well positioned to offer institutional clients a wide range of products and services.</p><h4>How do you assess the performance of the Muscat Securities Market (MSM) in 2013?</h4><p>The main driver of the Omani economy, apart from the banking sector, is government expenditure and family business. However, there is no adequate representation in the MSM and hence does not reflect the economic progress of the country in full measure. The government-led project, through public and private sector participation, includes a wide range of infrastructural spending, though is yet to find a place in the MSM through IPOs or listings. Similarly, family offices and business have no incentive to approach the equity market as they have access to cheap funds from banking channels. However, I am confident that given time, the MSM is very well positioned to help the government achieve its objectives of creating jobs, enhancing the income of citizens, and having a better balance of Omani employees and expatriates in Oman. Besides the big family companies and government projects, we have a huge unrepresented SME sector that is playing a large role in the economy. There has to be a trickle-down effect.</p><h4>What do you make of the regulatory policies of the Capital Market Authority (CMA)?</h4><p>The CMA in Oman has been playing a major role in supporting the MSM. Its staff is flexible, professional, and has pioneered many initiatives in the region. The MSM and its regulatory counterpart the CMA function in sync and have over the years established themselves as successful regulatory bodies. Oman also has brokerage companies and fund management companies of sound repute in the region. Hence, we definitely have what it takes to make a good stock exchange. That being said, now the focus and the argument should change from what MSM should do to encourage trading to what brokers and the CMA should do. The question is; how can the government realize the importance of the MSM in achieving or assisting its macroeconomic objectives? We have a structural challenge here. My argument is that the government should come up with policies and incentives to encourage the private sector to set up public companies. If you analyze the history of Oman, you see that we have many publicly listed manufacturing companies. In the late 1980s, the government decided to promote the industrial sector and came up with interest-free loans and tax holidays, and supported Omani tenders. The business community was given an opportunity to benefit from all this, provided they launched a company that was 40% public. This was a successful model and was initiated before there were large numbers of business people in the country. Now, our population has grown significantly along with the number of educated people, providing a better environment for all. The government has to come up with innovative ideas to promote public companies. There are three elements to the solutions: economic policy, capital market, and economic objectives; the key is how these are interlinked.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How do you assess Oman's traditionally low insurance penetration?<br></h4><p>Currently, the Sultanate of Oman has very low insurance penetration as a percentage of GDP, as is the case in GCC. Presently, only third-party motor insurance is compulsory, whilst all others are optional. Unlike Western countries and many of its counterparts, people here think of insurance only as a last resort. However, the situation is slowly changing. A low volume of high-net-worth (HNW) individuals, both expatriates and Omanis, would purchase insurance. But, corporate companies are realizing the benefits of purchasing employee benefit insurance, medical insurance, workers' compensation, and group life cover for their employees, and as such these classes of insurance have shown a remarkable increase in the last few years. To take advantage of the situation, Falcon Insurance Company extends excellent life and medical and workers' compensation insurance coverage and has developed an extensive portfolio of corporate clients since its inception. Many of our clients are realizing the importance of insurance, and I am sure a few years down the line that retail insurance too will snowball into a bigger market.</p><h4>Is the insurance market evolving as people see the benefits of insurance?</h4><p>Yes, the market is evolving; however, in terms of buying insurance voluntarily, it is still a long way off. I personally am of the opinion that in the next five years, the Omani insurance market might witness a visible jump/enhancement in terms of insurance, especially in the personal lines segment. A decade ago, society operated in a different manner. In case of the unfortunate death of an earning member of a family, the relatives and friends would pool money and take care of the family of the deceased person. However, that is not the case now, and people are realizing the importance of saving and having a back-up plan in case of misfortune. The working population is growing, especially in the cities. We find that the percentage of couples working, both males and females, has increased over the last few years, thus directly increasing the potential for saving. Nuclear families have given them an opportunity to save more and invest wisely. They are indeed realizing the importance of the different types of insurance available in the market, and we find many people buying policies like those related to savings for marriage, retirement, and children's education, for example.</p><h4>What do you think will be the impact of takaful?</h4><p>Falcon Insurance Company is a conventional insurance firm, whereas takaful is an Islamic insurance concept, and as such it has a completely separate and different entity. The basic tenet of insurance is that the risk of one is shared by many. This concept does not change between a takaful insurance company and a conventional insurance company. Overall, the arrival of takaful companies will have an effect on our share of business in the market. In regard to the creation of new business by the availability of takaful products, we will have to wait and see.</p><div class="quote">“  Falcon Insurance Company is a conventional insurance company, whereas takaful is an Islamic insurance concept. "</div><h4>How do you see the insurance market evolving over the next five years?</h4><p>The insurance market is evolving at a slow and steady pace, especially life insurance. In terms of business, we haven't seen any major new projects coming up in the last two years, and hence our focus is on retaining our clientele listing and, of course, developing and increasing our reach wherever possible. In the last few years (2004 to 2011) the number of insurance companies has increased drastically. However, the size of the market together with premiums have not grown as much. Oman continues to be regarded by many reinsurers as the most under priced and over competitive in the GCC. I strongly believe that this scenario will have to change in the next few years. Moreover, the regulators are now working toward forcing insurance companies to have a minimum capital of OMR10 million. New licenses are issued only with this criterion. That leaves existing companies that have a capital less than OMR10 million to either request shareholders to inject more funds, find new stakeholders, or look at merger options with other insurance companies with similar issues.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Petroleum Development Oman (PDO) evolved in recent years?<br></h4><p>PDO has a distinguished history. The first cargo was in May 1967 from the early developments in the northern fields, which produced generally light oil. Work gradually shifted to the southern fields, moving toward infill drilling, horizontal drilling, 3D seismic work, and water floods, and more recently with enhanced oil recovery (EOR), which is an area through which PDO differentiates itself from all other companies. Our geology is complex; our fields are more mature and they tend to be smaller than our neighbors. Pressure support is more limited and oil viscosities tend to be higher, with an increasing level of sour gas production. We have had to move into a significant program of EOR technologies. We are the only company in the world that has thermal, miscible, and polymer chemical injection recovery mechanisms within the same concession, all of which are in full-scale implementation.</p><h4>Which EOR technologies are the most important for PDO today?</h4><p>Polymer injection is effectively the most embedded and advanced field application; however, miscible gas is very significant and thermal processes are expanding every day. The key point is that at the moment they represent 3% or 4% of our total production, so they are relatively small. By 2020 or 2021, however, more than one-quarter of our production will be linked to these recovery mechanisms. There will be an exponential increase in the contributions made by EOR technologies in the future.</p><h4>How significant is the research PDO does into EOR?</h4><p>I am a strong believer that research is about effective implementation more than just having it on the shelf. PDO is particularly strong in technology testing and deployment, with considerable experience in identifying and assessing new tools and processes and with proficient implementation practices. We have very strong technology relationships with a number of entities, with Shell as a significant partner and stakeholder. We also have partnerships with Sultan Qaboos University, alongside a number of industry projects with key service and technology providers across the world. At any one time, we have in excess of 70 different technologies being tested, simulated, modeled, or implemented in the field. In some areas, we progress to full-scale adoption, while in other areas we are in the early front-end assessment and development stages.</p><h4>What opportunities exist to market PDO's expertise elsewhere in the world?</h4><p>I think EOR technologies developed in Oman will be increasingly exported to countries that are looking to progress through similar development challenges, across the full spectrum of seismic exploration through to development applications. Oman is recognized as a center of best practice in oil and gas exploitation. Increasingly, this is focused on the well and reservoir/facility management of our operations, our water management and reservoir imaging technologies, our artificial lift experience, and so much more. This knowledge and operational experience is showcased and exported to a number of countries, principally in the GCC, but also beyond and in the same way as PDO seeks and pursues best practice from other countries. That is one of the strengths of working with our international partners such as Shell, Total, and Partex, where you are networking, capturing, and sharing best practice wherever that may be.</p><h4>What chemical and geographic complications do you face drilling in Oman?</h4><p>As you progress through the more complex challenges, you have to step up the level of associated mitigation and risk management measures. The challenge doesn't mean a higher risk. You have to deal with the challenges with appropriate safety measures and mitigation programs, lowering risks to the lowest possible level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Shell's involvement in Oman developed?</h4><p>Shell's involvement in Oman goes back to 1937, when the initial contract was agreed. The form of the partnership between Shell and Oman has changed over the years, but from about 1980 onwards it has a joint venture with the government of Oman in Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), and since 1999 with Oman LNG, when the first LNG was produced.  Shell represents 34% of the PDO venture and 30% of the Oman LNG venture. We also have Shell Oman Marketing, which was floated on the Muscat Securities Market in 1997, with 49% of the shares owned by Shell and the rest owned by Omani investors. The Shell Development Oman office was set up in 2001 for the purpose of formalizing Shell's in-country governance and support presence. I sit on the boards of PDO, Oman LNG, and its sister company Qalhat LNG. I also chair the board of Shell Oman Marketing, which is involved in market retail, commercial fuels, aviation fuel, and so on. In this office we also house Shell Technology Oman, a group of between 10 and 15 people doing enhanced oil recovery R&amp;D for PDO.</p><h4>How does Shell work to develop social infrastructure in Oman?</h4><p>Our social investment agenda falls into four parts: employment, enterprise, environment, and road safety. Employment is the biggest, the main thrust being to create training opportunities with the Oman Society for Petroleum Services (OPAL) in industry, through which people are trained with the promise of a job upon the successful completion of their training. The Training for Employment project has been running for some years now and has been quite successful, creating an average of 140 jobs per year. These projects also include training for people with a range of disabilities for suitable jobs. We were awarded the Sultan Qaboos Award for Social Responsibilities in 2012 for our efforts. On the enterprise side we have an SME fund and we have a partnership with Grofin, the operator of the fund. Grofin is an SME fund specialist, and it set up a fund here in Oman for us, which has been running since 2007. We've invested $17 million in the SME fund and we're trying to attract young businesses that have already started up and need a boost, not just by investing money, but by helping them develop business and marketing plans. Its aim is to create jobs through Omanis starting up and growing their businesses, or taking businesses to the next level. The environmental side includes various projects that we've been working on. The road safety side aims to try and push the awareness of road safety in Oman through schools, families, and the Oman Road Safety Association (ORSA). The loss of life we're seeing is unnecessary, and we hope to bring in more awareness and the right rules and controls to prevent that happening. Our main thrust has been both through the Oman Road Safety Association (ORSA), an Omani NGO, and through schemes in schools to create awareness, and we've done that in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and Royal Oman Police. One more initiative is the Outward Bound Oman project, which enables youngsters to go outside and appreciate what the country has to offer, exercise, and pick up leadership skills. This year it runs as an independent organization. It started off in 2009, is headed by Mark Evans, and has gone from 100 to over 1,300 young people in 2013, including both Omanis and foreigners. That's our social investment side in a nutshell.</p><h4>What level of support do you provide to PDO?</h4><p>The biggest support we provide is through people and technology. In short, we work to ensure that all the strengths we believe make Shell competitive flow into PDO. Coupled with that is Shell Technology Oman's R&amp;D. That is paid for by PDO, but there are also strategic alliances where PDO and Shell pool money to develop future projects and initiatives. Among these big future projects are enhanced oil recovery techniques, which are being matured by PDO. Shell is helping with this new technology and Oman leads the world in this area. We aim to help PDO not just replace its reserves, but also replace future contingent reserves so it has a stable 10-year plateau. We help with the future, but also with day-to-day problems, asset integrity, system reliability, and reservoir maintenance to keep production levels up and maximize the value of each asset. On the people side, we have an agreement with PDO for it to use the Shell Graduate Training Process, which it has branded as its own to guide youngsters from study through to being functioning engineers much quicker than would usually happen.</p><div class="quote">“  Shell represents 34% of the PDO venture and 30% of the Oman LNG venture. "</div><h4>How do you evaluate PDO's training and development of its Omani staff?</h4><p>The company has about 7,000 employees and it is roughly 80% Omanized. It has done a great job, with help from Shell and others, in terms of training and capability transfer with a lot of on-the-job training and help. A very visible measure of success is the leadership team, which is all Omani, except for the Managing Director. That gives you an example of how seriously it has taken the subject of developing Omanis. PDO isn't just an exporter of oil, it's an exporter of people into the Omani economy. Ex-PDO people emerge in all areas of the economy, and for good reason, because they've been tested, trained, and had work and leadership exposure.</p><h4>How else do you instill Shell's worldwide values and quality control?</h4><p>PDO has its own culture and identity, and we don't try and change that. It does, however, use many Shell standards, be they engineering, financial, ethical compliance, or other standards. There's also the absorption of Omanis into the Shell system. All their top leaders have spent time in the Shell system worldwide, and that continues. We aspire to have 100 Omanis in the Shell network at any one time.</p><h4>How do you see Oman's production capabilities changing in the future?</h4><p>I think Oman has done a great job at keeping a stable outlook. Oil was first produced in the early 1960s, today peaking at its highest production level ever for gas and oil. PDO alone produces over 1 million barrels a day oil equivalent, which is higher than it has ever been. Exploration is also extremely active, both in PDO and in other blocks. There are more and more production and exploration opportunities, more revolutionary production technologies, as well as a growing diversity of operators, which is up to around 20 now. BP is also coming in the future, and this is great for the oil and gas sector.</p><h4>Do you think more competition is conducive to better production?</h4><p>Definitely. It's a great thing. PDO used to have a dominant position, which may have been healthy at the time to try and kick-start technology and get the oil and gas sector up and running, but as others have come in, it has created a very healthy environment.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Omani oil and gas sector over the next five years?</h4><p>Very exciting. Khazzan and Makarem, operated by BP, is a tight gas project that will soon make its investment decision. Whether in tight shale or oil and gas, there is activity everywhere. The outlook is bright.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has your business developed and evolved?<br></h4><p>I am the Co-founder and CEO of Gulf Energy, which today is a leading service provider in Oman, employing around 750 people. Prior to 2005, the contribution of local players in the services industry for oil and gas was only 3% or 4%, and today that figure is around 25%. We started in 2005 and took up this challenge, bringing strong leadership to the services sector. Oilfield services is a sophisticated sector and requires know-how, expertise, and technology in order to have the ability to compete and deliver high-end service quality to customers. This is especially the case in Oman, where the production of oil and gas is very challenging given the complex reservoir geology and environment. Our main focus remains to ensure that we are technically successful; we have learned that if you are technically successful, clients will demand your services more and commercial feasibility becomes more realistic.<br></p><h4>How did the idea for Gulf Energy come about?</h4><p>Capitalizing on the 10 years of experience that I had from working in the oil industry, it was time to think about doing something to contribute to localize some of the services in the oilfield services sector. The Ministry of Oil and Gas has made the support of local industry a priority. Hence, we leveraged this support and came up with state-of-the-art services through Gulf Energy. Today, Gulf Energy is home to many sophisticated technologies and provides its services to all operators in Oman. In line with increasing the in-country value (ICV), we have embarked on the manufacture of oilfield products and we currently manufacture different products ranging from oilfield chemicals to well completion equipment. Our company has managed to take the lead and compete with major companies and win a larger and larger market share in Oman. Recently, Gulf Energy expanded its operations to Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq.</p><h4>How did you build your reputation to compete with the oil majors?</h4><p>When we started in 2005 we started as a backup contractor to Schlumberger, Halliburton, and Baker. We have managed to convince our customers with our superior performance and thanks to Petroleum Development Oman (PDO), which allowed us, without a track record, to take on small contracts to demonstrate our capabilities. However, that did not last long, and we immediately proved ourselves and started winning bids and more market share, and this has positioned Gulf Energy as one of the leading service providers in Oman. The span of our services covers reservoir evaluation, cementing, stimulation, drilling and workover, and completion services.</p><div class="quote">“  We were awarded a new contract for fracking and this made our company the first indigenous fracking company in the Middle East. "</div><h4>How much of your portfolio is with the largest oil companies?</h4><p>PDO controls about 80% or 90% of all the oil production in Oman, so it is the oil major with the highest volume. Occidental is also a major part of that, and today there are newcomers such as Daleel Petroleum and CC Energy, to which we are currently delivering services.</p><h4>What challenges are you presented with working in Oman's geography?</h4><p>Clients see it as a challenge; we see it as an opportunity. The challenges in Oman are present across the country. The geology of Oman is very complicated, as you can see from the topography. Today, we produce oil at 300 meters and at 5,700 meters. There is heavy oil, as heavy as 12 API and volatile oil with an API as high as 42, and there is gas, sour gas, sweet gas, and very hard formations. All this gives us opportunities, whether it is in the north or south. The south has heavy oil; when the oil becomes less mobile, the recovery factor drops. Right now, we are involved in many aspects to improve the productivity of the oil, whether it is through steam injection, where we have technologies to allow the client to evaluate the steam, increase the quality of the steam, or operations in the steam well. PDO is also using polymer flooding in order to displace and increase the viscosity of the water so it can push more oil through. Such processes require a lot of technologies before, during, and after the polymer injections. Our company hosts many technologies and products in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and improved oil recovery (IOR).</p><h4>How much of your work is with gas?</h4><p>We provide many services during the drilling of gas wells and also during the post production of such wells. The services include services related to well construction, stimulation, and well completion services. The challenges in gas are different from those in oil. Because most gas is found in very tight reservoirs, such reservoirs will need to be fracked in order to produce efficiently. We were awarded a new contract for fracking and this made our company the first indigenous fracking company in the Middle East, and we are due to commence operations in 4Q2013.</p><h4>What potential is there for Oman to export its technological know-how?</h4><p>We already doing that, and currently have operating contracts in Yemen and Iraq. We recently opened offices in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and are in the process of bidding in those two countries.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Gulf Energy?</h4><p>The plan for Gulf Energy over the next five years is expansion. However, first of all we need to anchor our operations in the region and invest in technology. There are many niche markets here that require specialized technology to be brought into the region. We are expanding outside of the country. At the same time, we are raising our presence in Oman through technology and service quality.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What role do you feel the Oman Society for Petroleum Services (OPAL), as a not-for-profit organization, plays in the development of Oman's oil and gas industry?<br></h4><p>It is the corporate meeting point for companies active in the oil and gas sector in Oman—the operators, producers, service companies, construction contractors, and logistics operators, and also suppliers of a general nature bringing a host of commodities and services into the concession areas, and more. OPAL was established by the oil and gas sector and mandated to look after its interests. Of course, by mandate, OPAL does not involve itself in the commercial aspects of the sector, meaning it does not look at the volumes or prices, or even costs of production or the project-specific details of the operators and producers. But aside from that, it has oversight of all the matters of standards and excellence and issues that are faced by its member companies and the sector at large. The current roles encompass the development and adoption of standards spanning across health, safety, and the environment (HSE), Omanization, remuneration, and HRM/HRD, for example. OPAL has, throughout the past decade, supported specialized forums on subjects related to the sector and has been active in communicating best business practices on subjects of interest to its members. OPAL also facilitates mediation and communication between the sector's companies and regulators on various topics affecting members of the oil and gas industry in Oman. It also contributes to the strategic projects adopted by the sector that have a positive bearing on the national economy and that make a significant contribution to the communities in Oman.</p><h4>What are the biggest human resources and training needs currently facing the industry, and how is OPAL helping to address them?</h4><p>Human resource and training needs in the country are at unprecedented levels, and changes in the complexity of jobs are opening up new horizons for the progression of talent. On the other hand, the redefinition of employment terms and remuneration levels has been creating a shift in the attractiveness of different sectors of Oman's economy. OPAL works together with members of the industry and other target sources of input to address these needs. Among other initiatives, OPAL facilitates the employment and retention of young Omanis through its “Training for Employment" and “Training for Development" schemes, besides some other initiatives. In these processes, OPAL identifies employment opportunities, finds target recruits, arranges training providers, and secures the investment source to fund the training process from public and private contributors. These initiatives have placed more than 8,000 young Omanis into jobs over the past decade and helped facilitate progression for many.</p><h4>How would you assess the development of consistent health, safety, and environmental (HSE) standards, both in Oman and industry wide?</h4><p>HSE management and standards are part of the core focus of OPAL. In this regard, we review the HSE management systems adopted by our members through HSE Certification. With the growth of operations and activity in the oil and gas sector, one obvious consequence is the growth of HSE hazards and exposure and, hence, the importance of this role in the society. With a lot of commonality in the domain of managing HSE in organizations, there is vast scope for specialty. And this specialty brings in the challenge of ensuring the constant updating of HSE management systems into the functioning of each operating entity and focused efforts to ensure implementation. There are no exceptions where operating entities would not have any HSE exposures. New techniques gained from actual incidents and potential incidents in the industry form the source of wisdom for the future avoidance of incidents. Therefore, it is a continuous process of dynamic evolution based on knowledge gained. In Oman, we are no different than most places in the world where oil and gas operations take place. Many factors influence the types of hazards to which the industry is prone, and hence the safety management process will always continue to be a source of challenge needing full vigilance and adaptation all the time. No compromise is acceptable here.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Areej developed over the past decade?</h4><p>Areej was the first factory, and also one of the first major businesses, established in Oman in 1980. Originally, we were an import substitution unit, with production of about 2,000 tons per year. Today, we are perhaps the third largest player in the GCC—we are number one in Oman, number two in the UAE, and number three in Saudi Arabia. We have grown from producing 2,000 tons to 180,000 tons, marking a 90 fold increase in capacity over these 30 years. Our range has improved from originally just one or two oils to a range of products. Now that the market is moving into consumer foods, we are selling more than just oils and fats. We expanded into producing blended butter and margarine, and we also entered the mayonnaise and salad dressing markets for Heinz. We have grown in our scope and size tremendously. The beauty of Oman is that it is truly a market-driven economy, which is unusual in the Middle East. Oman is a free economy and that is why we can trace the growth of our company parallel to the growth of many companies in the West in terms of size, technology, and management.</p><h4>What is the source of your processing technology?</h4><p>Fortunately, our technology is brought in from all over the world and put together by us. We buy technology from anywhere in the world. For example, we bought our last processing plant from Italy and our support plants from Malaysia. We have four fully automated plants, where the operators control the plant with a computer and keyboard.</p><h4>How many staff members do you employ?</h4><p>We have a total of over 600 employees, 60% of whom are Omani, with expatriates mainly working in technical fields. Our fully automated machinery incorporates a high level of electronics. Our SAP system for business management is one of the world's best, and this is part of what makes our plants integrated across the supply chain.</p><div class="quote">“  We have grown from producing 2,000 tons to 180,000 tons, marking a 90 fold increase. "</div><h4>How integrated is your production process?</h4><p>We have just one factory that imports raw oils from around the world and refines it. We get palm oil from Malaysia, corn oil from the US, and sunflower and soybean oil from Argentina or Ukraine, depending on the season. We carry out the whole process from start to finish. We make the caps, bottles, and handles, as well as assemble the various parts. We purchase plastic pellets and raw oil. The company also buys the paper labels and packaging.</p><h4>How international is your market and how much of your oil is exported?</h4><p>We are 25% local, but the Omani market is so small that our activity accounts for about 65% of Oman's market. We have three brands in the local market, and everything we sell is designed for household consumption. Most of our products are consumer packed, both for the local and GCC markets. In total, 75% of our products are exported—Areej has a 30% share of the Saudi Arabian market, with a slightly higher share in the UAE. We export to the entire GCC, but our basic markets are from Syria on the West to Iraq in the East, Russia in the North to Egypt in the South. We also export specialized products to North America.</p><h4>What international partnerships have you formed?</h4><p>We manufacture for some of the top food companies in the world. We produce fats for Kraft, oils for Unilever, and mayonnaise for Heinz. These brands are marketed throughout the MENA region by the multinationals themselves.</p><h4>What major trends have you identified in the Middle East food industry?</h4><p>There are two major trends in the food business: low-fat diet products and convenience foods. However, eating low-fat foods in the West is much more popular than in the Middle East. That is why we see convenience foods growing faster in the Middle East. Areej first moved into the low-fat segment about 10 or 15 years ago, but the low-fat products simply didn't work that well in the Omani market.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Areej?</h4><p>Our future vision is to continue developing the convenience foods segment. Business-wise it makes more sense, because being a commodity business does not allow us to increase margins. Convenience food is an area that has experienced rapid expansion—we get the best returns and employ our management and technical prowess to the maximum advantage in the segment. Our processes are all internationally approved, and we are at the high end of the market, aiming to integrate our work with other world markets.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the culture at Omantel unique?</h4><p>We merged two companies to form Omantel: Oman Mobile and Omantel. Oman Mobile was responsible for running the mobile business and operating the mobile license, while Omantel was the mother company operating fixed lines, international telephony, and ISP services, as well as capacity sales for international and local carriers. The two companies were merged and, over the last four years, we have brought the two cultures together into a whole new model. This new culture is based on an operating model that is customer-centric. In the past, we were more of an operational functional organization, where the division of responsibilities was based on the function. We have now three main units in the company, and these are based around our customers. We have the corporate unit, another consumer unit, and thirdly we have wholesale, serving the carriers. This structure meant that the rest of the company's culture had to adapt in terms of mindset, not only in terms of organization. The culture has been evolving to be more geared toward customer needs, and now we are focusing on making every aspect of the customer experience excellent. We are spreading this culture of an improved customer experience.</p><h4>What do you do to promote an enhanced customer experience?</h4><p>We do it through staff training. We have campaigns based around the kind of internal mindset-shifts that we desire. The organizational culture is one of the full delegation of responsibility. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are measured on a quarterly basis for some, but for salespeople or technical positions, they have weekly, monthly, and quarterly KPI checks. We believe this has made the company more efficient and has also increased investor confidence. Our shares have improved as a direct result of empowering people in this way.</p><h4>How important is your corporate services division to your future growth strategy?</h4><p>The country is undergoing a number of infrastructure mega-projects at the moment attracting multinational corporations, and I think there is a lot of potential there—not only in the connectivity arena, but also in the service arena. Instead of just providing connectivity, we are rendering services that are above and beyond that. We are trying to go higher up the value chain. We have set up a whole new company called Oman Data Park in order to complement the services that we are already providing to our corporate clients. This will be a fascinating growth area.</p><h4>How does Omantel respond to the high levels of competition in the market?</h4><p>Each segment has different key elements that need to be focused on. The consumer segment is extremely price-sensitive, in addition to quality and coverage considerations. For this, we continuously review our products and services. We try to improve coverage, though we already have by far the widest available. In terms of quality, we have our fixed network that connects everything, and we have loops around the country that protect the customers from any cuts in the network. With the corporate sector, it considers quality and resilience before price. For the consumer, we are continuously revamping our offers, and for the last four years we have been the fastest-growing mobile network. Along with our partners, FRiENDi and Renna, we have been regaining market share from the competition, which is something that is not common in the region; the newcomers usually take from the incumbent.</p><h4>What do you make of the level of foreign investment in Oman's telecommunications sector?</h4><p>It is a welcome addition to the economy. However, we believe that the country still needs new infrastructure and that foreign investment must be geared toward a licensing scheme that is conducive to deploying infrastructure. In Oman, with many areas not covered for different services, you need to have policies and regulations that are conducive to infrastructure building. We have over 97% coverage of populated areas.</p><h4>Do you expect internet penetration to continue rising as rapidly as it has been in recent years with more smartphones coming out?</h4><p>The thing about smartphones is that once they come into the market they tend to stay—a bit like used cars. When you bring in a faster network like 4G, people who can afford it will buy the new devices. The old devices then get sold on or passed on, and the technology trickles down, leading to a mix in your customer base. You cannot suddenly start reusing the 2G frequency for 3G, because some people will still need a level of service. What you can do is optimize the use of the three networks so that you push more voice traffic to 2G because that is what it is good for, and then push the data usage to 3G and 4G. When these 4G devices come they help us to offload congestion from 3G to 4G, but this goes slowly because only a certain amount of people can afford the new technology.</p><h4>What is the significance of the new submarine cables that have been coming to Oman in recent years?</h4><p>We look at Oman's sustainable competitive advantages in the region in terms of its geopolitical position and consider how we can use this to benefit the sustainability of Omantel. This is where the policy of increasing the number of submarine cables to the country came from, because we know that we are outside of the congested Gulf, in open waters with a unique opportunity. Geopolitically, Oman is a friend of all and an enemy of none, so this has made our job easier. We have selectively acquired cables that have a competitive advantage over existing cables. One of these is a cable that runs through Iran, Russia, and Eastern Europe to Frankfurt. This one is largely on land, and this means that it is faster to fix as it takes four hours to retrieve a cable on land and an average of 21 days at sea. Another advantage is its latency. There is also a new cable with another competitive advantage. Most internet traffic goes westward, but we are now working on one called the Bay of Bengal. It goes through India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and then Singapore and connects to the internet in the East. This gives us options when there are problems with the internet coming from the West. There was a cut in May 2013, and we were the only company that was able to continue, and in fact we sold excess capacity to other providers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the telecommunications sector in Oman?</h4><p>I think Oman has achieved remarkable penetration numbers since market liberalization. There is room for growth in terms of going higher up the value chain of new services. This comes with people moving from traditional mobiles to smartphones or from people who already have smartphones buying iPads or other technologies. The other element is that we are moving more toward machine-to-machine communications. There are more and more companies that are connecting their fleet management systems, for example oil or logistics companies; there is lots of potential in this area. The socioeconomic and climactic conditions of the region tend to encourage people to stay at home and therefore use broadband more than in other areas of the world. One is that the government is already quite advanced in placing fiber-optic cables in Muscat. The other driver is an external one, which is that people are purchasing more and more Wi-Fi-based devices from TVs to phones to other technology. We are seeing growth in this phenomenon.</p><h4>What is your vision for Omantel going forward?</h4><p>What you need to look for in a company is a sustainable competitive advantage. We are identifying our sustainable competitive advantages and reinforcing them. One of these is our backbone and recovery loops that allow us to give close to 100% availability at a fixed network level. We have set up a strategic investment policy that encourages brownfield investment, but we remain open to any opportunities that come our way. Thus far, we do not have any that we are looking for, and we are not aggressively following greenfield opportunities. We are trying to make the company's income streams sustainable by improving international connectivity through submarine cables. Over the last four years, we have moved from three cables to nine. According to Arab Advisors, a telecom industry research institution, we have become number three in the region and we are growing. In the future there will be less tolerance of service failures as companies cannot go without the internet for long. This is an area that makes our competitive advantage as a carrier more sustainable, and I believe investors see this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did Gulf Mining Materials (GMM) start as a miner in Oman?<br></h4><p>In 2005, we established GMM and opened our first chrome ore mine in Wadi Maharam. In order to overcome the difficulty posed by the lack of accurate geographical information in Oman, I formed a small team of engineers to seek out minerals in the mountains and visit new sites regularly. The paucity of reliable data was problematic for us at first. Oman's stock of chrome ore is estimated between 1% and 2% of the world's reserves, but these figures may be hugely inaccurate and underestimated. The mineral business has many uncertainties and inherent risks. I have always taken more than moderate risks, be it in mining in Oman or through joint ventures in Turkey, Albania, Egypt, or Sudan. By nature, I do not mind taking risks if my instincts tell me there could be the possibility of success.</p><h4>How did GMM establish Oman as an international chrome ore exporter?</h4><p>In 2006, when we started to export chrome ore, Oman exported less than 50,000 tons annually. By 2008, Oman was exporting almost 1 million tons. GMM established a market for low-grade Omani chrome ore, which was previously inconceivable. We were the first company in Oman to set up a large-scale chrome ore crushing and screening mechanism for different sizes of ore. GMM was also the first company to establish a chrome ore concentrate plant, which helps in the upgrading of low-grade ore that was otherwise unusable. We are also in the process of building a ferro-chrome plant in Oman and have increased the capacity of our chrome ore beneficiation plant, alongside investing in our chrome ore mines and proposed concentrate plants in Albania and South Africa. We have also made a foray into marble mining and processing as well as gypsum.</p><h4>How is GMM placed in the global marketplace?</h4><p>We do not feel significant competition in Oman, as we are already the market leaders and fix the market prices for Oman chrome ore. The major competition comes from South Africa and Turkey. However, through our consistent efforts, cost efficiency, and the development of the GMM brand name by our team under the leadership of our CEO Kanwal Gambhir, we have been able to establish our products successfully in China and India. This has resulted in continuous demand for our products, despite the recession and the competition. Being an expert chrome ore mining company, opportunities bound for operating mines in other countries—particularly Albania, South Africa, and Egypt. GMM has its own offices in China, Egypt, and South Africa. However, we feel it is crucially important to have a diverse business offering. Besides chrome ore, we mine marble, gypsum, limestone, and laterite in Oman, nickel in Albania, and granite in Egypt. We also trade in minerals from South Africa and Turkey for exports to China and India.</p><h4>What are GMM's most important strengths?</h4><p>Our reputation, strict quality controls, and reliable delivery commitments have been our three main strengths. These are very important in the mineral business, and we have been able to compete successfully. The result of this is that in the last six years, our product has never been rejected by any buyer due to quality problems. This is an extraordinary achievement, as the rejection of materials is very common in the mineral business. We have always been pro-active in terms of meeting customer expectations, be they quality, time schedule, or specific requirements, such as size. We employ a flexible and pro-active approach. When the market crashed and prices fell by more than 70% in September 2008, due to our foresight and pro-active approach to offer small discounts and other relevant spot decisions, we ensured that we received payment for all of our shipments. Some miners and suppliers went bust during that period, as buyers refused their shipments. Finally, due to our cost efficiencies, we have been able to weather the fall in chrome ore prices better than other producers. This advantageous situation means we are looking to expand internationally, while our foreign competitors are facing difficult conditions.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has International Marble Company (IMC) developed since 1999?<br></h4><p>We started mining marble in 1999 after a survey of the mineral reserves and geography of Oman was carried out by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Once we realized that there was marble in Oman, we began operations. Today, we are the largest marble processors in the world offering brands such as Desert Rose, Desert Beige, and Desert Oasis. Our daily production is 14,000 sqm of marble, and we have completed many projects locally and internationally. We have supplied approximately 700,000 sqm of marble for projects in Oman, the largest of which was the Muscat Royal Guest Palace (Qasr Al Alam Al Amer). The Palace required marble 7.5 centimeters thick. We also provided materials for the Royal Opera House, which required approximately 100,000 sqm of marble. We are currently exporting our materials to 52 countries through our network of agents worldwide.</p><h4>What have been your most successful projects?</h4><p>The largest project we have undertaken was in Dubai for the Palm Jumeirah. The work included 700,000 sqm of marble and took around 18 months. In China, we carried out a project of around 300,000 sqm, which was not easy. This is the advantage of IMC versus other companies throughout the world for the fulfillment of marble for huge projects. We have one quarry, and from that one location we can deliver all of the materials according to approved samples. Most of the other companies have more than one quarry, which makes them difficult to supply materials in huge quantities.</p><h4>What quantity of reserves do you estimate remain in the quarry?</h4><p>The study from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which was carried out by a consultant company, put the depth of the quarry at 30 meters. Today, we have already gone down to more than 200 meters, and we still have approximately 200 meters left before we reach the end of the reserves. We expect that we have enough marble to last the company for 20 years. We are also looking for more mines, which we predict could be located near Ibri. We have already begun work on a new quarry about 10 kilometers from our current work site.</p><h4>Do you have any plans to expand your capacity?</h4><p>IMC reached its current capacity in 2012. We have entered the second phase of our factory. Although the factory is huge and we are using only about 30% of its full capacity, we feel that we can increase our production. We have plenty of material to work with in the quarry, but for now, 14,000 sqm daily is enough for IMC. Economically speaking, the requirements of the global market are our main priority. If need be, our factories can cater to the needs the international market demands.</p><h4>How do you remain ahead of the international competition in the marble mining industry?</h4><p>Competition is fierce in this market, especially from countries that have similar materials, such as Turkey, Iran, and Egypt. Italy and Spain also have a wealth of mineral resources, but the costs in Europe are high, and we face very little competition from companies in that part of the world. However, competition with low-cost countries remains a factor. A second factor is that in Oman we are not allowed to export blocks. We have to do the processing here, and that adds value to the country. We add value in the processing, not in the quarry. This is thanks to an excellent decision made by the government.</p><h4>What sets IMC apart in the marble market?</h4><p>IMC is a specialist for large projects. Other companies struggle to supply the quantities we can, especially if there is limited time. For us, time is not important, and for this reason we are getting many projects at once: we have concurrent initiatives in South America, the Far East, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, China, and India. In a limited amount of time, we can fulfill the requirements of several large projects, and that is an advantage for us. Saudi Arabia is the largest growth market, in addition to China and India. On the whole, the GCC is the number one market for us. We are not considering opening any mines internationally, but we will always remain open to possibilities.</p><h4>How are logistics organized for the export of marble?</h4><p>We ship full containers to different ports worldwide from Oman. Trailer trucks owned by us transport the marble containers to the ports. The government has plans to close the Port of Muscat and use Sohar exclusively. This will not affect us because we use Sohar's port already, and it is not far from our factory. We are ready also to shift to Sohar and work from there. However, for local shipments in Oman, we use our own trailers.</p><h4>What is your environmental policy?</h4><p>Oman has strict environmental policies, and for this reason we also have ISO 14001 certification for our protection of the environment. We are the only marble company in the GCC that was awarded the ISO 14001 with the scope of the mining, processing, and supply of natural marble. Therefore, we are very dedicated to conserving the environment. IMC also received the ISO 9001 certificate for its Quality Management System.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the marble mining industry in Oman?</h4><p>The industry has already expanded to reach most of the country. There is a future for this business, but it does need more attention from the government. A number of countries have gotten involved in materials production, and many have made mistakes; we are working to ensure that we don't suffer the same fate. First, exporting blocks is a mistake made by many countries. Second, opening more quarries and launching competition among companies to drive prices down leaves no export benefits. In some countries, competition between local companies reached a level where if they were not selling at an extremely low price, then they had to close their factories.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of IMC?</h4><p>Considering our growth from 1999 until today, we have been moving along smoothly and sustainably. We have done a lot of work to reach this level, and it all began in 1999. Today, we are the largest marble processor in the world. IMC is engaged in many projects and the company doesn't depend on local demand. Of our production, around 10% is allocated to the local market, and around 90% is exported. In 2012, we reached a daily production figure of 14,000 sqm, which we are currently satisfied with. However, we want to take steps forward and bring our activity up to the next level, which depends on demand from the international market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights for Gargour Holding over the past year?</h4><p>We are trying to maintain our solid position while still investing in the company's growth, despite the turbulent situation in the Levant that has led to economic slowdown. We are building our group for the future. We are determined not to stagnate so as not to fall behind when the situation improves in the coming years. We are finalizing and opening a new showroom in Beirut during 2013 in addition to the expansion of our network throughout Lebanon. We are following the same network expansion in Jordan. For Syria, we have finalized our investments and we hope that the crisis will come to an end soon in order to explore opportunities there. In addition, the group is looking into opportunities in the Levant to also expand in terms of brand representation.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Lebanese demand for cars?</h4><p>Some years ago, the luxury market was driven mainly by medium to large cars, while the low-budget car segments were mainly dominated by used cars imported from the EU, and later from the US. Total used-car sales were double the volume of new cars purchased. Over the past two years, the used market has dropped to be replaced by new Korean cars. On the other hand, the fashion trend in the luxury market was moving toward smaller, yet sporty and dynamic cars. The younger generation is tending to move toward compact cars, and that is why Mercedes-Benz is expanding its product portfolio in favor of smaller and more dynamic cars, such as the A-Class and CLA.</p><div class="quote">“The younger generation is tending to move toward compact cars, and that is why Mercedes-Benz is expanding its product portfolio."</div><h4>How would you compare the premium car sector in Lebanon with other countries in the region?</h4><p>We cannot compare Lebanon with the Gulf countries, such as Saudi Arabia or the UAE, for two reasons. Firstly, in Lebanon, we have a customs duty that is quite high in addition to VAT. Secondly, the GDP per capita is much lower than the GCC. Nevertheless, Lebanese people like to own the latest models as part of their lifestyle and image. In addition, owning a car is considered as the second investment after a house. The increase in real estate prices has positively affected the sales of luxury cars, which are considered relatively affordable when compared to property. Many of the landlords are wealthy and can afford to make any purchase at any price. Even in New York, few have this kind of cash. Also, there are no taxes on property, so it is almost a tax-free heaven here, except for indirect taxes, such as customs duties on cars and electricity.</p><h4>In terms of sales, which model is in the greatest demand?</h4><p>The most popular models are from the E and C-Classes. Then, we also have our SUV, mainly M-Class and the iconic G -Class, which is sold out. Of course, we also have the S-Class and have recently introduced the A-Class. It is a new concept small car, and will be a perfect fit for the Lebanese market. The AMG version of the A-Class can be sold to the young owner of a Porsche, because the car comes with a very powerful engine. Mercedes is producing a new line that will extend the age range of its customers. At first, there was too much focus on the middle- to high-price ranges, or on certain age groups, but now the brand is increasingly targeting the youth.</p><h4>In terms of the other markets that you cover, which ones are performing best?</h4><p>Jordan is still doing well, despite the turbulence in the Levant. We had enjoyed a strong presence in Syria, but we have been out of activity there for the past couple of years. At the moment, we are developing a project that will not be ready for another year or two. We are looking into the feasibility of constructing an assembly plant in the area for commercial vehicle production.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for the premium sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>The premium sector will always be good. I say “always" because, unfortunately, if a customer is in a bad financial situation, their car will be linked to it. The car is a part of their status. Therefore, they will try to maintain the type of car or brand that they are driving. It becomes a question of habit. It is like when you live in a 150-sqm apartment and then you move to a small 75-sqm one; it can take its toll mentally. In addition, around three times the current population of Lebanon have left to work abroad, which creates a major pillar for the Lebanese economy. These immigrants still inject cash into the country and invest further. For instance, the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class took place in mid-2013, when the showroom is ready. All vehicles are already sold out until the end of the year. We do not have enough cars to sell even though they are worth over $200,000.</p><h4>What would you like to add in regard to the automotive sector?</h4><p>The taxis in Lebanon urgently need to be changed; they are terrible. Everywhere else in the world, taxis are clean and neat, but here you see old, dirty, and unregulated vehicles. The taxi fleet in Lebanon is at around 5,000-6,000 vehicles, and with 7,000-8,000 new cars we could project a better image. We have requested the government to introduce an incentive scheme to facilitate this transition where buyers would not pay customs tax or VAT. We also propose a stipulation taxis be changed every five years, to maintain a new fleet. They have done this in Brazil, and now in Sío Paulo there are something like 25,000 new cars—all white, all beautiful, and everywhere. Lebanon would benefit from this.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has the Port of Salalah developed and grown in recent years?</h4><p>The interesting aspect of the Port of Salalah in an Omani context, and even regionally, is that it is purely market driven. Two shipping lines approached the government suggesting a world-class container port in that particular location. Because of this, it was almost a guaranteed success. If the market says there is a huge need and is willing to invest its own money, then further business will follow. Since the launch of operations in 1999 until 2012, the results are 665% growth in container volume and over 600% growth in general cargo volume. There are massive opportunities for the location and for the country. The company was formed in 1997 by a joint venture between the Omani government and two of the largest international shipping lines—Sea-Land and Maersk—and immediately listed on the Muscat Security Market (MSM). Between 1999 and 2001, A.P. Mí¸ller went through a series of acquisitions and restructuring, and what emerges today is APM Terminals, one of the world's largest terminal operators for both inland and onshore terminals. It is a 30% shareholder and manages the day-to-day operations at the port. The entire weight of the A.P. Mí¸ller group and its expertise in all areas is behind the Port of Salalah.</p><h4>How significant is your relationship with APM Terminals?</h4><p>We have access to expertise, training materials, and learning experiences from other ports. At the same time, there is also a major advantage for APM Terminals in having Port of Salalah in its portfolio, because it is a multi-user facility that is focused on the market. We bring commercial connections to the table. It has been a very good relationship on both sides. Omanization in skilled jobs at the Port of Salalah is 70%, and we are very pleased that today the majority of mid-level and senior staff are locals. We actively train Omanis by sending them to work in other ports around the APM Terminals' network in addition to bringing in world-class expertise to train our people here in Oman. They also participate in our management training programs at international business schools like IMD or APM Terminals' internal development courses such as MAGNUM and RMDP, where the aspiring leadership travels for training at several ports over the years for development in leadership, port operations, commercial and financial skills, and more.</p><div class="quote">“We have millions of dollars in technology investments ongoing."</div><h4>How did the port perform in 2012?</h4><p>In 2012, we had a fantastic year, growing by 13% on the container side and 11% on the general cargo side. We achieved 3.62 million TEUs, which is the highest that the port has ever achieved. We also handled 7.2 million tons of general cargo, which is again the highest that the port has ever handled. Now, we are starting an expansion that is going to be completed by the end of 2013. It will give us far more capacity on the dry bulk side, but it will also triple our liquid bulk capability, which has become a very popular product. We have already essentially pre-sold around 65% of that capacity. The expansion will give us 1,200 meters more berth. However, in reality what it will do is allow us to really support local businesses, such as the mining companies in particular on the dry bulk side, to increase their volumes drastically. We expect to double our mineral dry bulk throughput by mid-2015. Right now, we have just over 2 million tons of liquids handled annually, and I expect that will be 4.5 million tons by the time the expansion is operating in its first year.</p><h4>How important is the success of the Salalah Free Zone for the port?</h4><p>It is absolutely vital. To me, it is not about how much money gets invested in an area, but about how much activity a company will see through the local economy annually. A successful free zone is in the port's interests, and vice versa. Without the port's direct connectivity to 60 global markets by over 3,200 ships annually, the free zone customers would have a difficult time transporting their products to markets. Supporting the free zone in attracting businesses to set up in Salalah is one of the pillars of our strategy. We have grown our Commercial Department by 200% to support that.</p><h4>How does investment in technology affect the port's operational success?</h4><p>We have millions of dollars in technology investments ongoing. We have just finished the development of a new terminal operating system for our general cargo terminal, which will add value to the port and to our customers, who will be able to receive real-time information on their commodities and vessels. This will allow the customers better efficiency out of their supply chain and improve their competitiveness. Furthermore, on the container terminal side we have had the market leader in terminal systems, NAVIS, installed for years. It uses algorithms to reduce the driving distances of the trucks at the port, positions the vessels along the berth in the best spot possible to reduce the overall cost of operations, and automatically assigns jobs to the most efficient location or staff member. The port has just signed a contract to install differential GPS units in all of our equipment to ensure the highest levels of efficiency and planning. All of these investments are just the foundation for a platform called SmartYard, which APM Terminals has developed. Now that we have optimized the ships and the trucks, SmartYard will optimize the yard cranes and allow a reduction in waste of up to 30%, which translates into cost savings for our customers. At the same time, we are also working together with the government on putting 70 yard cranes onto the electrical grid rather than having them driven by diesel engines, which will save the environment around 16,000 tons of CO2 a year, and save the government more than $2 million a year in fuel subsidies. There is further technology investment in other sections of the business that will take us closer to our goal of being the port of choice that local and global customers use to connect their businesses.</p><h4>What advantages do shipping lines stand to gain from utilizing the port?</h4><p>The shipping lines gain automatically because they utilize the Port of Salalah as a hub, making us a network that can save them time and money. The Port of Salalah provides the fastest connection times to the Indian Ocean Basin and throughout the entire East African-Indian Gulf with the main trade lanes of Asia and Europe. That is where shipping lines can save their money, by taking these huge ships that generally have great economies of scale, and using a central location to get as close to the final market locations as possible. These network savings reach into the tens of millions of US dollars annually. Additionally, local Omani businessmen can use the backbone of the network to reach their markets. We provide major value to the lines, and then the local businesses get to piggyback on that.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What makes the culture at Omantel unique?</h4><p>We merged two companies to form Omantel: Oman Mobile and Omantel. Oman Mobile was responsible for running the mobile business and operating the mobile license, while Omantel was the mother company operating fixed lines, international telephony, and ISP services, as well as capacity sales for international and local carriers. The two companies were merged and, over the last four years, we have brought the two cultures together into a whole new model. This new culture is based on an operating model that is customer-centric. In the past, we were more of an operational functional organization, where the division of responsibilities was based on the function. We have now three main units in the company, and these are based around our customers. We have the corporate unit, another consumer unit, and thirdly we have wholesale, serving the carriers. This structure meant that the rest of the company's culture had to adapt in terms of mindset, not only in terms of organization. The culture has been evolving to be more geared toward customer needs, and now we are focusing on making every aspect of the customer experience excellent. We are spreading this culture of an improved customer experience.</p><h4>What do you do to promote an enhanced customer experience?</h4><p>We do it through staff training. We have campaigns based around the kind of internal mindset-shifts that we desire. The organizational culture is one of the full delegation of responsibility. Key performance indicators (KPIs) are measured on a quarterly basis for some, but for salespeople or technical positions, they have weekly, monthly, and quarterly KPI checks. We believe this has made the company more efficient and has also increased investor confidence. Our shares have improved as a direct result of empowering people in this way.</p><div class="quote">“I think Oman has achieved remarkable penetration numbers since market liberalization."</div><h4>How important is your corporate services division to your future growth strategy?</h4><p>The country is undergoing a number of infrastructure mega-projects at the moment attracting multinational corporations, and I think there is a lot of potential there—not only in the connectivity arena, but also in the service arena. Instead of just providing connectivity, we are rendering services that are above and beyond that. We are trying to go higher up the value chain. We have set up a whole new company called Oman Data Park in order to complement the services that we are already providing to our corporate clients. This will be a fascinating growth area.</p><h4>How does Omantel respond to the high levels of competition in the market?</h4><p>Each segment has different key elements that need to be focused on. The consumer segment is extremely price-sensitive, in addition to quality and coverage considerations. For this, we continuously review our products and services. We try to improve coverage, though we already have by far the widest available. In terms of quality, we have our fixed network that connects everything, and we have loops around the country that protect the customers from any cuts in the network. With the corporate sector, it considers quality and resilience before price. For the consumer, we are continuously revamping our offers, and for the last four years we have been the fastest-growing mobile network. Along with our partners, FRiENDi and Renna, we have been regaining market share from the competition, which is something that is not common in the region; the newcomers usually take from the incumbent.</p><h4>What do you make of the level of foreign investment in Oman's telecommunications sector?</h4><p>It is a welcome addition to the economy. However, we believe that the country still needs new infrastructure and that foreign investment must be geared toward a licensing scheme that is conducive to deploying infrastructure. In Oman, with many areas not covered for different services, you need to have policies and regulations that are conducive to infrastructure building. We have over 97% coverage of populated areas.</p><h4>Do you expect internet penetration to continue rising as rapidly as it has been in recent years with more smartphones coming out?</h4><p>The thing about smartphones is that once they come into the market they tend to stay—a bit like used cars. When you bring in a faster network like 4G, people who can afford it will buy the new devices. The old devices then get sold on or passed on, and the technology trickles down, leading to a mix in your customer base. You cannot suddenly start reusing the 2G frequency for 3G, because some people will still need a level of service. What you can do is optimize the use of the three networks so that you push more voice traffic to 2G because that is what it is good for, and then push the data usage to 3G and 4G. When these 4G devices come they help us to offload congestion from 3G to 4G, but this goes slowly because only a certain amount of people can afford the new technology.</p><h4>What is the significance of the new submarine cables that have been coming to Oman in recent years?</h4><p>We look at Oman's sustainable competitive advantages in the region in terms of its geopolitical position and consider how we can use this to benefit the sustainability of Omantel. This is where the policy of increasing the number of submarine cables to the country came from, because we know that we are outside of the congested Gulf, in open waters with a unique opportunity. Geopolitically, Oman is a friend of all and an enemy of none, so this has made our job easier. We have selectively acquired cables that have a competitive advantage over existing cables. One of these is a cable that runs through Iran, Russia, and Eastern Europe to Frankfurt. This one is largely on land, and this means that it is faster to fix as it takes four hours to retrieve a cable on land and an average of 21 days at sea. Another advantage is its latency. There is also a new cable with another competitive advantage. Most internet traffic goes westward, but we are now working on one called the Bay of Bengal. It goes through India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and then Singapore and connects to the internet in the East. This gives us options when there are problems with the internet coming from the West. There was a cut in May 2013, and we were the only company that was able to continue, and in fact we sold excess capacity to other providers.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the telecommunications sector in Oman?</h4><p>I think Oman has achieved remarkable penetration numbers since market liberalization. There is room for growth in terms of going higher up the value chain of new services. This comes with people moving from traditional mobiles to smartphones or from people who already have smartphones buying iPads or other technologies. The other element is that we are moving more toward machine-to-machine communications. There are more and more companies that are connecting their fleet management systems, for example oil or logistics companies; there is lots of potential in this area. The socioeconomic and climactic conditions of the region tend to encourage people to stay at home and therefore use broadband more than in other areas of the world. One is that the government is already quite advanced in placing fiber-optic cables in Muscat. The other driver is an external one, which is that people are purchasing more and more Wi-Fi-based devices from TVs to phones to other technology. We are seeing growth in this phenomenon.</p><h4>What is your vision for Omantel going forward?</h4><p>What you need to look for in a company is a sustainable competitive advantage. We are identifying our sustainable competitive advantages and reinforcing them. One of these is our backbone and recovery loops that allow us to give close to 100% availability at a fixed network level. We have set up a strategic investment policy that encourages brownfield investment, but we remain open to any opportunities that come our way. Thus far, we do not have any that we are looking for, and we are not aggressively following greenfield opportunities. We are trying to make the company's income streams sustainable by improving international connectivity through submarine cables. Over the last four years, we have moved from three cables to nine. According to Arab Advisors, a telecom industry research institution, we have become number three in the region and we are growing. In the future there will be less tolerance of service failures as companies cannot go without the internet for long. This is an area that makes our competitive advantage as a carrier more sustainable, and I believe investors see this.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been done to ensure the insurance industry continues to grow and meet market demand?</h4><p>The growth of any insurance industry depends mainly on two or three factors. One is that you have the right regulatory framework in place, meaning that people who wish to invest in the market are confident that their investments will be protected. The second factor is the policyholders themselves. If they feel that the company will be there to pay their claims, more people will purchase insurance once they feel the investment is stable and protected. Another factor that determines growth is the economy itself. If a country's economy is doing well, the insurance sector will also do well.</p><h4>Are regulations in place to protect consumer products?</h4><p>Every company or investor in this market has to comply with regulations and legal requirements. You need an adequate amount of capital to channel into the business, and the right staff to run it. Our office supervises market conduct, as well as the prudential fitness of the companies operating in it. We are there to make sure that these businesses are there to pay claims and honor the obligations and promises they make to their customers. These are the criteria ensuring that those that want to buy insurance, or invest in this kind of business, can be confident of their return at the end of the day.</p><div class="quote">“We want to grow the life sector because we believe it is capable of determining insurance penetration more easily."</div><h4>What is being done to increase insurance penetration?</h4><p>Our penetration rate is at 1%, which is common, given that we are a developing market. Most of the emerging markets range between 1% and 2%, and below 3%. One reason for such low penetration is the culture itself, because insurance is something that you have to believe in. It is a consideration the benefits of which require visibility to be trusted and depended upon. In Tanzania, we do not have a savings culture like in Japan or India. There, the savings ratio to GDP is around 16%, whereas in a country like ours the percentage is no more than 5%. The lack of education and awareness is another factor curbing our penetration levels. Poverty is another major issue. To be able to consume insurance, you need disposable income. And naturally, if you are living within or below the poverty line, you have none. These are the factors that have been affecting the penetration ratio of insurance in Tanzania as a percentage of GDP.</p><h4>Which sector is set to see the highest growth?</h4><p>We want to grow the life sector because we believe it is capable of determining insurance penetration more easily, and can generate and channel more savings for investment. The life sector can also develop when the investment vehicles in or around the country are yielding a return. This enables you to assure the consumer that a life product will bring a return on investment. The products we are selling inevitably address the issue of death. However, we want to introduce products that also underline the concepts of saving and investment such as unit-linked policies. With these products, when someone buys life cover, the money paid as a premium on a monthly basis is attached to a certain investment. That investment is also listed on the stock exchange. Profits made are returned to the life policy.</p><h4>What is your vision for the Tanzanian insurance market for the next five-to-10 years?</h4><p>We believe in insurance just as people believe in banking, or other financial services. Through these vehicles, countries will be able to address the issues of poverty reduction and wealth creation. We want insurance to become a tool toward that end, which is where the issue of micro insurance comes in. Low-income citizens need to be able to improve their lives through micro insurance products, and micro insurance is now on the agenda of every meeting that we attend on this continent. Countries like India and Bangladesh were able to emerge from poverty through micro finance and micro insurance.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>TIGO started operations in Colombia in 2006. What has been your growth strategy since then?</h4><p>I would say our focus on the customers made the difference, as well as our focus on innovation. We were the first to offer many products and services to Colombian customers. We focused on customer care, the quality of our network, and innovation as the pillars of our growth.</p><h4>How do you manage to strengthen the quality of your customer care? What are the techniques behind it?</h4><p>I really believe that the way we see the customer is totally different from how others see their customers and, despite us saying we are a telecommunications company, we focus on the quality of our network first. That is why, today, our network is by far the best in Colombia in terms of data services. We invest heavily in our call center and store locations, providing a unique customer-service experience.</p><div class="quote">“Data traffic is about 60%-70% of our revenue, and I think that the focus has to be on data in the future."</div><h4>What does innovation mean to TIGO?</h4><p>Innovation can represent many things. For example, we strive to bring the latest phones to our customers, or to provide timely customer service for repairs, and we were also first in selling unlocked phones. We have a plan called the “Arma Tu Plan," and we have more than 50,000 combinations of plans, so each customer can customize a special plan personally, which is something that is totally unique in the market, both in Colombia and in Latin America. It is really complex to put such a plan in place, but after that is done, no one has matched it, even now, and we launched that over a year-and-a-half ago. It is clear to our customers that we are different. If you see the growth of the industry in the past, with the numbers that the Ministry of Telecommunications has released, you can see that we are growing twice as fast as the market. The industry is growing 6% and, in the last two or three quarters, we grew by 17%. Clearly, our strategy to focus on customers is paying off.</p><h4>How would you describe the competition in the mobile sector in Colombia?</h4><p>It is a very concentrated market, the second most concentrated market in the world. There are challenges here, but I think that, over time, we will succeed in bringing in more competition.</p><h4>How do you plan to be more competitive?</h4><p>We will achieve this through a greater focus on the customers, and bring innovation into all services. For example, with the merger that we are planning to do, we can add more products to our portfolio and better services. We have a lot of plans for the future.</p><h4>How would you categorize the Colombian customer?</h4><p>Colombians love technology. I work in a number of countries, and I only see this in Argentina and Colombia; I think that they are unique in terms of technology and innovation. For example, in terms of data usage, you can see that it is important for them. It is a market with a lot of ambitions in terms of bringing in the latest technology or products. Also, the Colombian customer is quite demanding with regard to services. During the past year, customers have made it clear that they want better services. Data traffic is about 60%-70% of our revenue, and I think that the focus has to be on data in the future. I think we are among the most developed markets in the region, probably behind Argentina and Chile. However, it is still too low, and there are many opportunities to keep growing in that area.</p><h4>What can be done to increase this kind of market?</h4><p>We need to bring more affordable smart phones to the market. I think that the reality of this market is that smart phones are still too expensive for many people. Thus, the growth will come when we manage to lower prices. Another issue is to further develop the pre-paid segment in terms of data, because 70%-80% of our total business comes from pre-paid, and data is still a post-paid-dominated business. Our growth rate is stable, at 30% per year, so that is a good result, but we can grow faster.</p><h4>What can you tell me in terms of 4G coming to Colombia?</h4><p>I think that 4G will be a challenge; we are too early in the market. We probably need a little more time, and the customer probably needs some time because we are still working on the 3G network. We have the opportunity to enter the 4G segment, which is the premium network today, and we believe that we will launch by late-2014 or at the beginning of 2015.</p><h4>Which investments do you think are necessary to boost the ICT sector in Colombia?</h4><p>Clearly, we really need to change the competitive environment that we have; it is too closed. It is difficult to compete with companies that possess a total monopoly, and I think that we need more support from the government in terms of placing limits on the competition and in establishing the right limits for the regulatory environment.</p><h4>What is the significance of the ICT sector for the Colombian economy?</h4><p>It is very relevant. The last time that I looked, the ICT sector accounted for more than 3% of the country's GDP. It is relevant, and all markets of this industry are relevant. The country is huge; you can find more than seven cities with populations exceeding 1 million people. If you want to connect these seven cities, the best way to do it is by plane, thus you need a strong telecommunications environment to do this.</p><h4>Do you think there is a lack of infrastructure in the sector?</h4><p>I'd rather see it as an opportunity for investment and I would say that, if you invest in Colombia, you would probably get a good return.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the ICT sector in 2014?</h4><p>For the sector, I believe that it will probably grow between 5% and 8%.</p><h4>How many employees does TIGO currently have?</h4><p>Roughly we have 6,000 people, including direct and indirect employees.</p><p>© The Business Year - January 2014</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Lebanon is a leading name in the world of trade and services, in addition to its high standards in the fields of tourism, education, and healthcare. How can the Lebanese economy further develop its potential and boost its competitiveness?</h4><p>Experience has shown that political and security disturbances have repeatedly had a major negative effect on economic activity and growth. This sensitivity is due to the volatile nature of our main economic sectors. Tourism, financial services, construction, and real estate respond quickly and, more often than not, significantly to an escalation in political tones, intensification of armed skirmishes, kidnapping outbreaks, or tension at the borders. Past administrations have been unable to undertake the necessary reforms and create the adequate framework to allow for the budding of basic sectors that are less vulnerable to turbulences, such as industry, agriculture, and international trade. Greater efforts should have been devoted to create a robust network of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements to facilitate exports, set-up adequate regulatory bodies to monitor product quality, and build confidence in the “Made in Lebanon" brand and a strong reputation for its brands and image in general. However, for an efficient utilization of these conduits, competitiveness should be boosted and preserved at high levels. This, in turn, cannot be realized without a relatively cheap and abundant energy supply, easily accessible and diversified transportation systems, productive labor force, and an advanced telecommunications and information platform. Regrettably, the period during which telecommunications and information technology started developing at a dizzying pace worldwide, Lebanon was immersed in a protracted conflict, which calls for a forceful catching-up process. All of the above need not be perceived as shortfalls, but rather as a vast unrealized potential that opens limitless investment avenues, very promising business opportunities, and a job creation machine that is needed to absorb the yearly 25,000 new entrants to the Lebanese labor market.</p><h4>Following new offshore discoveries, what are the prospects for the Lebanese energy sector and its impact on the national economy?</h4><p>The prospective natural gas and possible oil resources will constitute a new frontier for Lebanon. Despite what is expected to be a declining path for gas prices due to large new discoveries and the exploitation of shale gas, the impact of new supplies and substantial additional revenues from exports on a small economy like ours will be momentous. First, it will radically decrease our energy bill, which, given the endemic deficits of Électricité du Liban, will rapidly improve budget deficits with beneficial ripple effects on macroeconomic parameters, such as a decline in interest rates that free liquidity for private sector credit in a “crowding-in" effect likely to boost growth and employment. One risk of this scenario is inflation, and this is why a set of accompanying measures have to be introduced and monetary aggregates carefully monitored. Second, an increase in exports will help correct the imbalances in our trade sector and alleviate the need for substantial balance of payment surpluses every year to stabilize our current account. Third, the decrease in energy tariffs that will inevitably ensue and, beyond their direct effect on competitiveness for enterprises, will free chunks of disposable income for individuals that will uplift their consumption and saving patterns with positive consequences on investment. It is important to note also that the moment prospection zones are allocated, it is expected that oil and gas companies are going to start investing massively to rent offices, buy cars, hire accountants, lawyers, and employees. Experts say that the inflow during the first year, that is three to four years before gas is effectively produced, could reach $1 billion.</p><h4>Why is Lebanon an attractive destination for FDI and what are you expecting for 2013 in terms of inflows?</h4><p>Lebanon is an attractive destination for FDI flows because of all the potential I outlined,but also in view of the fact that rates of return are consistently very high. In addition, it is a known fact that the country has never defaulted on its debt, nor has any bank been allowed to collapse, despite the extremely difficult circumstances that we have been through. Therefore, domestic, regional, and international investors have never suffered from the type of ordeals that they have sustained in other countries. Even real estate, which slows in periods of tension, has never witnessed a bust, although it has gone through double-digit price increases for prolonged periods of time. The reason behind this healthy environment is a draconian set of measures related to real estate lending, which impose high equity requirements. We can add to all this a good quality of life with a vast array of cultural, touristic, and leisure activities as well as high-quality services delivered by an educated, multi-lingual population. But maybe most of all, it is because Lebanon is a free society. We have paid a hefty price in the past for this openness and this freedom, but we shall remain committed to its ideals. Freedom is one of the pillars of our culture. As for our expectations regarding FDI flows for 2013, they are modest given the difficulties in Syria. However, hopes are high that once political stability is restored, Lebanon will greatly benefit from reconstruction efforts. Prospects, therefore, remain extremely appealing especially given that, contrary to other countries that face economic difficulties, the space for reform in Lebanon is vast. A simple correction of electricity subsidies and an improvement of custom duties and tax collections (without the passing of any new taxes), will immediately decrease budget deficits and generate a virtuous economic circle. The vitality and the multi-dimensional contribution of the Lebanese diaspora also remains a major asset for Lebanon and the prospects of its development.</p><div class="quote">“  The prospective natural gas and possible oil resources will constitute a new frontier for Lebanon. "</div><h4>What is your vision for Lebanon's economic future?</h4><p>The ultimate economic objective is wellbeing. We want to guarantee all citizens access to education and health services of a decent quality, as well as a job, allowing each individual to earn a living in a dignified way. We also need to ensure, for retirees, pension levels commensurate with a rising cost of living and a safety net to protect them from the vagaries of old age. To fulfill these aspirations, we need to create a framework that compounds the joint inputs of both the public and private sectors given the major importance of private enterprise in the Lebanese economy. Our feeling is that what is needed, first of all, is an extensive assessment of the domestic economy and its limitations. It should be followed by serious consideration of what the nature of the economy is we want in order to reinforce the production sectors and limit volatility. Concerted efforts in this regard imply serious legislative action on the part of the public authorities to motivate a determined investment drive on the part of the private sector. We firmly believe that a law on decentralization, another on public-private partnership (PPP), and a battery of decrees to enhance the credibility and dynamism of the capital markets have become an urgent necessity. Investment is unquestionably the main pillar of growth. Consequently, everything should be done to encourage it and to give investors a feeling of safety and the assurance that their interests are protected. This ranges from responsible fiscal continuity to shoring up the legal apparatus by modernizing and upgrading the Lebanese courts. The lack of transparency, accountability, and proper governance is a very costly deficiency because the economic price of impropriety has a direct effect on competitiveness, and it is the public authorities' responsibility to address these issues and cure them radically. Extensive reform is overdue in so many areas and the task is colossal, but it is a sine qua non condition to realizing the double-digit growth we should aim at reaching and maintaining for the coming decade if we want to satisfy our legitimate ambitions. We have the means, and now we need a stronger will and a higher political sense of responsibility. Besides, in a way, the fact that so much remains to be done is in and by itself a reason to invest in Lebanon, for had we been a mature economy, margins for windfall returns would have been much narrower. What might help in harmonizing all these different thoughts is the setting up of a new ministry in charge of planning; not in the classical centralized-economy understanding, which is an outdated notion, but rather a vehicle for developing visions, perceiving prospective trends, and accommodating policy on a permanent basis to fluctuations in those trends.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for future bilateral relations between Cyprus and Lebanon?<br></h4><p>Cyprus and Lebanon share a very long history of deep-rooted brotherly relations, based on common principles, values, and fluid people-to-people contacts. These already strong bilateral relations have been further reinforced over the last few years. Consequently, we currently enjoy a genuinely robust bilateral relationship that spans across a wide range of fields and encompasses all spheres of political, economic, and social life. The geographical proximity of our two nations and the long history of contacts between our two peoples can only dictate that the bilateral relations between Cyprus and Lebanon will continue evolving into the future. In addition, the discovery of hydrocarbons in the wider region of the Eastern Mediterranean and within our respective Exclusive Economic Zones provides an added impetus for the further, substantial, and accelerated progression of our relations. In recognition of all the above, there is currently—more than ever before—true political will from both sides to significantly supplement the said bilateral relations in all realms.</p><h4>What is your outlook for trade between both nations in 2013 and which sectors of trade possess more potential for future development?</h4><p>Cyprus and Lebanon have always shared strong trade links. Lebanon is one of the main trading partners of Cyprus in the Middle East, with total trade of over ‚¬60 million in 2012. In the same year, Lebanon was Cyprus' sixth largest export destination of locally produced products. Over the last few years, the main domestic products that Cyprus exports to Lebanon are pharmaceuticals, plastic products, dairy products, and raw hides and skins. Cyprus imports mainly plastic and paper products from Lebanon. Furthermore, trade in services between the two countries was worth approximately ‚¬38 million in 2011. Services are the most important sector of the economy of Cyprus and continue to show rapid growth every year. Lebanese companies can use services from Cyprus such as insurance, advertising, accounting, legal, architecture and civil engineering, market research, medical, public relations, education, and software development services. There is also enormous potential for Lebanese entrepreneurs to use the strategic location of Cyprus as a platform for companies focusing on warehouse and logistics services, distribution and headquartering activities, aiming to export to European, African, or Asian markets. Referring to the potential of investment and growth, it is important also to take into account the significant developments in the wider region of the Eastern Mediterranean in the energy sector, and particularly in the hydrocarbon sector. The discoveries of large quantities of natural gas in the Levantine Basin, in combination with the potential of future gas findings in the area, create new perspectives and impetus to the role of Eastern Mediterranean in the global energy map and the European energy market. There is no doubt that bilateral trade and economic relations between Cyprus and Lebanon are very important. The aim of my government is to encourage entrepreneurs and the respective Chambers of Commerce and Industry to explore business opportunities between the two countries. We are optimistic about the future of our trade and economic relationship and we believe that there is room for further improvement.</p><h4>In 2013, Michel Sleiman, President of Lebanon, stated that Cyprus and Lebanon were boosting cooperation and looking into possible ways to explore oil and gas in their waters. What cooperation plans exist over the short term?</h4><p>The Republic of Cyprus has recently submitted to the Lebanese side a draft text of an agreement concerning the Joint Development and Exploitation of Cross-Median Line Hydrocarbons Reservoirs and proposed the speedy initiation of the negotiations with a view to conclude the above agreement as soon as possible, in order to achieve the optimal exploitation of possible common hydrocarbons resources. Having regard to the fact that Lebanon is in the process of running a licensing round for hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation in its Exclusive Economic Zone, it is important to be mindful of the possibility that there might be one or more hydrocarbons reservoirs, which extend from one side of the Median Line between Cyprus and Lebanon, to the other.</p><div class="quote">“  Cyprus and Lebanon have always shared strong trade links.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As the Director of the Middle East Department, how would you assess Lebanon's role in the region?<br></h4><p>Lebanon is a particularly interesting country. And, despite its relatively small size within the region, it boasts a rich social fabric that is reflected in the way the economy functions. Many compromises are made and deals struck to ensure that each segment of the country and its communities enjoy economic benefits. Indeed, this has enabled the country to weather many of the crises it has gone through to date. When considering where the country is truly making an impact regionally, the financial sector and banking industry immediately present themselves. The banking industry is active across the region; in Syria and Iraq, including the Kurdistan region, and Turkey. The industry is performing so well that some would argue that it is keeping the country afloat. It is the receptacle of the billions of dollars remitted by Lebanese citizens living abroad. These, in many cases, extremely successful individuals, retain a very strong bond to their country. The flow of money returning is absorbed by the banking system, which is a crucial and pivotal instrument of the economy, and, by extension, the country at large. In that sense, and despite shortcomings and some criticism, both within the country and abroad, the banking sector stands out and allows Lebanon to shine throughout its region. Then there is the human factor. The Lebanese people are educated, intelligent, multilingual, and extremely entrepreneurial. And, while resident the world over, they are particularly active in this region.</p><h4>Aside from the banking and real estate sectors, which areas have the most potential for growth?</h4><p>Focusing on what is available today, and without talking about as yet untapped opportunities, the potential for energy generation is huge. In this context, water is an important national resource that remains largely neglected. A glance at Lebanon's geography reveals mountains and valleys of incredible potential for energy generation. One would think that the strategic construction of a system of dams, for one, would generate sufficient energy for both domestic and regional consumption. It would make Lebanon a net exporter of energy. Imagine what Lebanon would look like if it is transformed from an energy-starved country to a net provider. Unfortunately, that is not happening due to institutional and political impediments and the practicalities of electricity distribution. In addition, and overall, if Lebanon is to become an attractive business hub for high-end companies, it requires energy that is both reliable and cheap. It would need a fully functioning telecoms industry, a modern transport network, and a dependable institutional framework conducive to long-term business planning.</p><h4>What is being done to attract investment to areas other than Beirut?</h4><p>If you look at the economic fabric of Lebanon, you note that a very large chunk comprises micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises. With this in mind, the World Bank has recently approved a project specifically targeting the development of such enterprises. The micro- and small-scale enterprises, in particular, play a key role in developing remote areas and enabling entrepreneurs to develop their own businesses and create economic momentum. By doing so, we are pushing back poverty and creating employment within the businesses individuals are working to establish. When considering SMEs, financing is a primary constraint, and so by working with the banking sector, including the central bank, and certain other intermediaries we have been helping small entrepreneurs obtain the urgent financing long unavailable to them. At the same time, we are working at building their capacity to put together viable business plans that represent attractive propositions for the banking sector to finance. In so doing, we not only provide financing opportunities but, also, instill the confidence that drives the entrepreneurial spirit. We provide incentives such as partial risk guarantees by working with the Kafalat SAL, an institution that helps filter and increase the funds that the banking sector is prepared to commit to this investment mechanism.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How does GlobeMed contribute to developing the healthcare sector in the country?<br></h4><p>We have a new motto: “Taking Care of Healthcare," because we believe our role is not just to manage the claims and see whether a bill is correct. Rather, we want to improve healthcare standards, and to communicate with the insurance companies and healthcare providers on best practices to ensure patients get the best healthcare at the lowest cost.</p><h4>How do you assess the healthcare industry in Lebanon?</h4><p>Lebanon remains the hospital hub of the Middle East because of its excellent education system. Health care and education are highly symbiotic; doctors and nurses have access to excellent universities, and Lebanese universities have access to universities in France and the US, from which they source cutting-edge technology. They are always on the lookout for new therapies and equipment. Health care in Lebanon, and healthcare delivery, are very good sectors. We have excellent hospitals, diagnostic centers, pharmacies, and doctors. The problem we are facing is in the cost of healthcare versus what people can afford. And this is where we come in. It is always a struggle to balance the quality and cost of healthcare. Because our country is blessed with very good healthcare and people who are ambitious about providing patients the best quality of care, they are always keen to have the best equipment, to perform the most modern operations or procedures, and to make use of the latest technologies and drugs. Of course, all of this has a cost.</p><h4>What is the added value of your expansion for your cardholders?</h4><p>We have created alliances within and beyond the region. Our insured members move around; they go from Saudi Arabia to the UAE, they come to Lebanon, they go to Syria, and return to Saudi Arabia. We wanted each of them to have our GlobeMed card and be recognized by all of our contracted healthcare providers so that they do not have to pay when travelling and then bring the bill when they go back to Saudi Arabia to be reimbursed. Healthcare providers contracted with any of the GlobeMed TPAs honor any GlobeMed card (wherever it is issued) and provide cashless services to cardholders against seamlessly automated guarantees of payment generated through a swipe of the card. Subsequently, we acknowledged that people travel beyond the region and we wanted them to benefit regardless of where they were. Accordingly, we signed contracts with organizations around the world to provide similar services, wherever our card members we to be found. Today, the original 17,000 healthcare providers that we were contracted to within the region have risen to more than 500,000 worldwide.</p><h4>What is your expansion strategy?</h4><p>Our strategy follows three principles. First is our vision of developing according to a schedule that covers the MENA region. We need to be present in every country there; this is where we want to be because it is our region, our language, our culture, and our backyard. We want people who are insured with any of the companies that we serve to be able to travel around the region and be served wherever they may be. The second strategy is more opportunistic in nature. We have visited places like Nigeria and the Ivory Coast having perceived an opportunity, even though they were beyond the scope of our immediate expansion strategy. As we have a team working in North Africa, and are already present in Egypt, we are currently working in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Libya, and Sudan. We are also contemplating locations of high potential, such as Turkey and Central Europe. The third strategy involves the franchising division. It is all about strategizing the way we work—making sure that the 12 current operations, and those coming about this year, all work uniformly. This not only involves the same color scheme, logo and name, but also the same information system, operating procedures, and more importantly service levels as well.</p>]]></richbody0content>

The sector, however, suffers from several issues related to political instability, the lack of clear policy and strategy in line with the government's economic policy, an unpredictable regulatory environment, and limited private sector involvement. The biggest challenge that we face in the sector concerns the level of political instability. This instability is a core issue, having recently been instrumental in limiting the interest of major investors. The second challenge is the fact that the country has not allowed its regulator to be fully independent, this in addition to a rather unpredictable regulatory environment. The government has established the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA), but it has been stripped of many of its powers and independence. If I were an investor, I would definitely want to know the policy that the sector works to realize, the kind of environment and regulatory framework I would be working in, and how predictable the policy and regulatory framework really were. Only then can you make informed assessments regarding rules and policies, including sector structure and licensing conditions, as well as the competitive environment. Essentially, if we do not create the right comfort level, it's going to be tough for us to attract investors. A third challenge is the lack of agreement on an ICT policy and strategy in general. The Minister has drafted a policy and we have reviewed and commented on it, but the government needs to adopt the right policy for future development. A fourth challenge is related to the private sector. Many claim that the private sector is weak in Lebanon, which is true for diverse reasons. One major reason is that it has not had a real opportunity to function in a competitive, open regulatory environment as most of the businesses are in the hands of the government, which presents a key challenge.</p><h4>How can these challenges be tackled?</h4><p>The truth of the matter is that these challenges are easy to overcome. There should be no problem in attracting investors if we can reach a point where ministers, governments, and policies don't change every six to 18 months. There must be an economic base to what we are doing, we must allow the TRA to truly function as a fully independent regulatory body, the regulatory framework we have developed must be implemented, and the private sector must be allowed to function and invest. From the point of view of strength, Lebanon has the right human resources to develop its ICT market. We are confident that, as far as the ICT market is concerned, we have a lot to offer, although the gap is wide between where we are and where we could be. There is a lot of money to invest and considerable potential to tap. The skills of the Lebanese people are there. The Lebanese population is at the cutting edge of technology—people like to socialize, communicate, watch videos, research, create, innovate, and exchange information; the market is thirsty, but there are many communication and informational needs that have not been met. There is a great need for ICT applications, services, content, connectivity, and infrastructure. A workable strategy has been prepared; we just need to enact it.</p><h4>What is the potential for Lebanon to become a regional digital hub?</h4><p>I am extremely optimistic. However, one of the challenges we face is the fact that we lack political consensus on how to move forward. If we systematically plan to move forward and the government becomes convinced that ICT is central to economic growth, everybody can begin to work according to a specific ICT policy and strategy, in everything they do with the government, and as they interact with the private sector and our citizens. We have all the ingredients to become a hub; we just need to make sure that our network infrastructure and capacity can handle what is required and that the business environment is conducive to companies coming to do business in Lebanon enabling them to exchange data and volumes between Lebanon and the rest of the world. It must also attract entrepreneurs and encourage new developments and innovations.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Information Technology Group (ITG) is part of a highly diversified group with operations all around the Middle East. What are your main drivers?</h4><p>Let me give you a brief history of our group first, which will give you a better idea of where we come from and where we are heading. The group was established back in 1967 here in Beirut. We started off at that time selling office equipment, such as Olivetti typewriters and telex machines. In the mid-1970s, during the era of mini-computers, we decided it was time to address the opportunities represented by the growing IT industry. When the Lebanese civil war started, in parallel with sustaining and developing our local business despite the difficulties at that time, some group executives moved to countries in the Gulf region to develop our operations there.</p><p>It's all about people. Our human assets are the main driver of our business. This is why, as opposed to most other companies in our region, our group has not been built as a “family business," and that's part of our DNA. Since the start, the founders made sure to retain the management team as well as key people through a structured shareholding system (similar in some ways to stock options in the US, but more adapted to the reality of our regional market). As an example, our mother group (the HOLCOM group) currently employs roughly 3,500 people, which include around 150 shareholders, who are normally the managers and the senior members of its various operations.</p><p>I personally manage ITG, which is affiliated to HOLCOM, and employs 550 people in Lebanon including 35 shareholders. We fully focus on ICT, selling a comprehensive range of hardware and software products along with related systems integration and support services. Depending on the various markets we operate in, we have different go-to-market schemes, ranging from selling to corporate accounts (such as banks, telecom companies, and major accounts) to distributing products through networks of resellers. Our group is also involved in IT retail, through the establishment and operation of its own stores in certain territories. When it comes to ITG, our largest customer segment is definitely banking, which is historically Lebanon's most vibrant sector. We have been actively promoting IT solutions to banks and financial institutions since the 1970s. Over the years, we have developed a deep expertise in the provision of banking solutions. It is also worth noting that we don't just cover Lebanon, but also serve banks in the entire region including the Levant, Egypt, the Gulf region, and elsewhere.</p><p>Concerning our group operations in Lebanon, and besides ITG, there are more than 500 people working in sister companies, including the Globalcom group (focusing on telecom and internet), which comprises IDM, the largest ISP in Lebanon, as well as GDS, which operates a data network covering the whole territory of Lebanon. The rest of the group, known as MiDiS, is present in virtually every country in the Middle East and has also expanded its operations to Eastern Europe and Africa.</p><h4>What are the strengths and weaknesses of the IT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Despite the difficulties that our country has passed through, IT has always been an active sector in Lebanon. Moreover, local IT companies have always considered that the rest of the region was their natural market too and have expanded accordingly. The strength of Lebanon's IT sector has a lot to do with the availability of very good universities here. We are able to attract freshly graduated talent, train them in our projects in Lebanon, and involve them in projects across the region. Some prefer to travel and work abroad, some prefer to be based locally. The IT sector in Lebanon by itself isn't very large, estimated at about $500 million, which is similar to the IT volume of a single large European city. However, we have always looked at the whole Middle East region and are not just concentrated on Lebanon.</p><h4>What is your outlook on innovation in Lebanon?</h4><p>Institutions such as Kafalat have been doing a good job in providing loans to small companies, which has encouraged innovation. Recently, the Lebanese central bank started a great initiative by providing guarantees to Lebanese banks so that they can provide loans at greatly reduced rates—even at 0% interest rates—to IT start-ups. There are many good, talented people with great ideas in Lebanon, but without the money, the management expertise and the proper marketing and sales reach, their ideas won't go anywhere. This is especially true in the IT business, where innovation is essential and where technologies change at a fast pace. Lebanon's challenge isn't just financing companies to develop ideas and products; we also have to put a framework together to help those companies gain access to international markets—that is in my opinion the biggest challenge Lebanese businesses face.</p><p>As a group, we grow organically through recruiting talent/expertise and incubating companies. In this context, we have established earlier in 2013 a new company called SysPro, specialized in energy efficiency and smart building solutions. But we also grow by acquisition. We have lately acquired many companies that we've successfully integrated within the group, the last of which was Fadel Systems (renamed PrimeWare after our acquisition), which specializes in the provision of Oracle-based solutions.</p><h4>What are your expectations for SysPro?</h4><p>Buildings are becoming more and more intelligent. We sell a lot of related products, electrical equipment, cables, power protection equipment, networking equipment, computers, telephones, and the like. These are being sold to both offices and residential buildings. We found that most of our clients wanted a single source for all of that, a single responsible entity that would deliver a turn-key solution and successfully integrate such systems; this is SysPro's mission. Around one year ago, we identified the need to have a company that could interface between the various contractors, architects, and building owners, giving them a one-stop-shop for integrating technology into buildings. We had to find the right people with the right experience, and we did just that in SysPro.</p><h4>How much investment potential is there in the ICT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>The potential is huge. Many companies have a lot of good people, with great software and intellectual property, but they lack sales reach in the market to sell their products across the region. That is something we can provide. ITG, as a holding company, firstly provides financial support to our affiliated companies. We can act as a bank for our affiliates. More importantly, we provide synergy between our affiliated companies. Our established companies have been in the business for years, with deep-rooted relationships with their customers. When we have a new company, we can give that company access to this valuable client base, which would otherwise take years to develop. ITG is keen to invest in areas that make sense for us and give our clients added value. There are currently 23 companies affiliated to ITG.</p><h4>Where do you envision ITG in the near future?</h4><p>I would like to see ITG as a pool of qualified IT people based in Lebanon and serving the whole region. I envision a team of professionals providing services to specific industries such as banking and finance, telecoms, higher education, hospitality, healthcare, and others. We are investing a lot in that direction and we believe that we have a unique position there to succeed throughout the Middle East. I don't know of any local or regional group that has our reach or our level of expertise in banking and financial software. Of course, I don't want to limit ourselves to banking or to any other vertical sector for that matter. Our group also comprises substantial “horizontal" expertise in Oracle and Microsoft technologies. We will nurture those kinds of value-added businesses and promote them across the region. We will develop ourselves organically and also acquire companies that will enable us to grow in sync with the dynamism of the ICT industry. That will help us take ITG to the next level.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Virgin Radio was very recently launched in Lebanon. What has been the reaction so far and what are your expectations for 2013?<br></h4><p>We launched Virgin Radio on May 14, and so far the response has been phenomenal. We did not expect the reach and penetration to go this far. We have many advertisers and have signed most of the major festivals, including Byblos International and Fíªte de la Musique. We have all the major resorts, which have switched very quickly to Virgin, such as Edde Sands and Iris Beach Club. Even the big clubs, such as White or SKYBAR, are now working with Virgin; even Middle East Airlines (MEA) is now affiliated. We ran a very successful marketing campaign and the brand name also helps. People know that Virgin Radio belongs to one of the biggest media brands in the world; it is number one in several countries.</p><h4>What makes Virgin Radio different?</h4><p>The Lebanese market has been the same for 15 years. Even the way radio has been executed in the past few years has not changed. We are calling Virgin the “next generation of media." We take technology, such as FM, and merge it with social media and mobile communication. This is why I think Virgin has been so successful with its penetration. People in Lebanon are used to interacting with stations by calling a phone line, and only using Facebook or Twitter as complementary media, whereas, for Virgin Media, social media is the access point to the station. For any promotion we are running, people actually answer through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or WhatsApp; we call the people, they don't call us. We do not use the classic model of “call us now," when only one person can get through; we usually have thousands of entries per competition.</p><h4>What makes the Lebanese listener unique?</h4><p>I would not say there is much difference between a Lebanese listener and listeners elsewhere. Culture helps, but, more or less, habits are similar worldwide. If a song is a hit in the US or in the UK, it is going to be a hit in Lebanon. What differs is what kind of music people listen to at what time of day. We conducted a massive market survey on listening trends with thousands of participants, from Beirut to Mt. Lebanon, covering ages 14-40. Our main target was ages 14-40, but it is now 14-28. The radio station is positioned according to the majority of the habits of that age group. From 7.00 am-9.00 am, the slightly older age group is going to work. From 9.00 am, the age group drops and younger people begin going to the beach during summer time. We know that our three main competitor stations play electronic music on Friday and Saturday nights. Based on our research, electronic music only targets 2% of FM audiences. This means that 98% have no choice. There are three stations competing for 2% of the listenership, so our policy is just the hits for Fridays and Saturdays. Of course, when you are going out to a club, restaurant, or cinema, you do not want to hear club music; you want to hear the music you know.</p><h4>Virgin Radio has very few commercial breaks. How can you pair this with profitability?</h4><p>Our rate card is at the higher end of the market norm, with a 30 second spot costing around $70. Statistically, we actually have a much higher listenership ratio during commercial breaks than other stations, because for the 40-minute duration of the 10 hits in a row, we are just gaining listeners nonstop. When other stations go to commercials, people usually zap. We have commercials, but you notice them a lot less and thus it becomes much more effective. Also, we conducted extensive research to find talented people with Lebanese roots to present our shows, as they can relate to the listenership and speak fluent English.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Trans Mediterranean Airways (TMA) evolved since its foundation in 1953?<br></h4><p>Between 1972 and 1980, TMA was the only Lebanese cargo airline flying worldwide, reaching Alaska, the US, Japan, and China, among many other destinations. Sold amid worsening political conditions, operations were suspended until 2005, when a bank purchased the airline. The new owner started restructuring the airline, and in 2009 it resumed operations. TMA is now in a comprehensive restructuring phase encompassing both technical and human dimensions.</p><h4>As a leader in cargo transportation, how would you evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>TMA is the designated Lebanese national cargo carrier, and our structure is based on a business plan prepared by Lufthansa Consulting. The plan takes into consideration the cargo hubs in Europe and Dubai, where Lebanon is only considered a transit point and not a major cargo hub. When we started in 2009, TMA was ranked 10th among airlines carrying cargo in and out of Lebanon, yet we have since risen to second place, behind Middle East Airlines (MEA), which owns a larger fleet.</p><h4>How extensive are your operations in Lebanon?</h4><p>Currently, and during the restructuring phase, we are rebuilding our network and plan to increase aircraft utilization for the two planes operated by TMA to 550 flying hours per month. We introduced the first Boeing 767-300 ERSF cargo aircraft in December 2012. Given sufficient demand in 2015, we will introduce a second Boeing 767, and a third aircraft in 2016. We launched twice-weekly flights to China and Central/Western Africa on October 23, 2013.</p><h4>What are your main routes today?</h4><p>Today, we operate four weekly scheduled flights to Kuwait City and Dubai in the Gulf, and Benghazi and Tripoli in North Africa. We also have routes from Beirut to Paris Charles De Gaulle, Milan, and Amsterdam.</p><h4>Who uses these services the most, and what sector has the greatest growth potential?</h4><p>Practically, we work through forwarders and agents, including well-known forwarders such as DHL Global, Expeditors International, and Fast Mondial. TMA enjoys an excellent relationship with its freight forwarders, and this plays an important role in ensuring our aircraft are fully utilized.</p><h4>How would you assess your fleet?</h4><p>We are not purchasing any new aircraft during the restructuring phase. Right now, it is very costly, and we are evaluating the best aircraft for our network. The study conducted by Lufthansa Consulting found that the current volume of cargo on our network and routes requires the introduction of the Boeing 767-300 ERSF, which is a long-range aircraft that is larger than the Airbus A300-600, and offers 10 tons of extra capacity.</p><h4>Who are your regular charter customers?</h4><p>The charter business today is a lucrative one; we dedicated half of our fleet in order to increase aircraft utilization. As we introduce routes to China and Africa, the charter business will be reduced; regardless, we will continue with that activity, since it is profitable and gives us the opportunity to fly worldwide. Mercedes-Benz and Renault are TMA clients to transport spare parts.</p><h4>You talk about the fact that Lebanon is not a central hub but a transit point. How are you working to make it more central?</h4><p>We are working on it, but we are not like a point-to-point national passenger carrier. The national carriers are obliged to fly passengers here with well-loaded cargo holds. TMA, as a pure cargo company, is selected by clients that need to ship huge quantities of goods. However, where the network is more concentrated beyond Beirut, there are business opportunities. On the other hand, as a national carrier, we insist on maintaining our schedule to Beirut to satisfy our Lebanese clients.</p><h4>What is the outlook for TMA and the logistics sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>I think the logistics sector in Lebanon is advancing amid constant growth. TMA has a future and we have developed a business plan for the period up to 2017. The cargo sector is growing. We have seen four fold growth from 900 tons per month in 2009 to 2,700 tons in March 2013.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been some of the milestones for Middle East Airlines (MEA) over recent years?</h4><p>When the Board of Directors took office in early 1998, it set for itself goals that can be summed up as building an airline that would be a source of pride for passengers, for Lebanon, and for MEA employees. After 15 years, we were able to achieve these goals by implementing a restructuring plan, reviewing the network, and increasing the level of service. Despite the challenging political and security crises that Lebanon witnessed in past years, MEA was able to achieve positive financial results for 12 consecutive years. Today, MEA operates one of the most modern fleets in the world and preserves the highest safety standards, thus earning the loyalty of its passengers.</p><h4>You recently signed an agreement with Airbus to upgrade your planes. How would you assess your fleet?</h4><p>MEA operates one of the most modern fleets in the world. The average life of the company's aircraft is less than four years. The MEA Board of Directors decided not to keep any aircraft more than 12 years old, so we are constantly renewing our fleet. This is done partly through expansion and partly by replacement. In 2012, MEA signed a firm contract for 10 A320/321 neo family aircraft, which offer fuel burn savings and reliability, as well as a modern and comfortable cabin. However, MEA will announce its engine choice at a later date.</p><h4>What are your most significant routes today, and are you planning to increase the number of routes and frequency?</h4><p>All destinations are significant for MEA. In Europe, Paris is the most popular destination, and MEA has four flights per day to Charles de Gaulle Airport (CDG), although we fly to most European cities on a daily basis. In the Gulf, we have 36 flights per week to Saudi Arabia, and up to five flights a day. MEA is not a long-haul operator; it covers Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Gulf area. We also have operations from four points in Iraq: Baghdad, Erbil, Najaf, and Basra. In July 2013, MEA launched its Yerevan route, and the airline looks forward to launching flights to Sudan as of November 2013.</p><div class="quote">“  MEA operates one of the most modern fleets in the world. The average life of the company's aircraft is less than four years. "</div><h4>In terms of passenger numbers for 2013, what are you expecting?</h4><p>We are expecting 2.3 million passengers. Additionally, we anticipate around 6.2 million passengers through Rafic Hariri International Airport in Beirut, a 5% increase on 2012 figures.</p><h4>How would you assess air transport in Lebanon?</h4><p>Air transport in Lebanon has many positive dimensions, and the country has an open skies policy. However, MEA does not have free access to all other markets, even though our market is open to all other airline companies, meaning that competition is unfair. For example, Emirates, and flydubai have five flights per day from Dubai to Beirut. We wanted to increase the frequency of MEA flights from two to three per day to Dubai; however, the UAE officials replied that there were no additional slots available. Secondly, we do not have effective anti-trust rules and competition laws in Lebanon. For example, if an airline decides to implement a discount policy to undercut the competition (price dumping), you can do nothing about it. The political situation is not helping us regain stability. The countries of the GCC have urged their citizens to avoid traveling to Lebanon or staying in the country as “a safety precaution," which has affected the number of Gulf, Middle Eastern, as well as the European tourists, so MEA is losing many of its business-class passengers. An increase in the number of passengers in reality means an increase in the number of economy-class passengers. Overall, we have seen a decrease in yield; it has dropped some 25% in economy class in the past four years due to the competition. Despite all of these circumstances, we are still making a profit. We have to restore stability, and then it will be very easy to regain the trust of the tourist market.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>Italy stands as the second trade partner of Lebanon, and the first within Europe. What is your outlook for trade between both nations in 2013, and which sectors of trade have more potential for future development?<br></h4><p>Overall, Lebanese trade has been growing steadily. Given the well-known slowdown in international trade and the turmoil close to its borders with Syria, this is a remarkable trend. Forecasts for 2013 mark a further increase. Bilateral trade with Italy is also increasing; in 2012, Italian exports to Lebanon amounted to ‚¬1.28 billion, while in 1Q2013 bilateral trade grew by 4.3%. Italy is the first European exporter to the Lebanese market, and the Italian presence is set to remain firmly rooted in all sectors ranging from investment goods to consumer products. We can count on a high degree of openness in the market and on triangular transactions in quality products with Middle East countries. Italian goods can also rely on an extensive network of agents and franchisees, especially in food industries, clothing, and footwear. Nevertheless, I believe that there are still many ways to explore and exploit the Lebanese market for Italian machinery, food, furniture, fittings, luxury cars, and leisure boats. Our excellence is well known in Lebanon. Italian institutions actively accompany our businesses to grab different opportunities; the Commercial Desk of the Italian Embassy together with the Italian Trade Promotion Agency (ICE) promote a variety of activities to reinforce the positive image of Italian brands among Lebanese consumers and to maintain Italy's position as first European exporter. In 2012, the Joint Italian-Lebanese Business Council was established as a flexible tool to gather Lebanese and Italian businessmen interested in expanding their activities within national markets and together in third countries.</p><h4>What opportunities are there in the maritime sector for both business and tourism purposes?</h4><p>For many centuries, Italy and Lebanon have been trading along the Mediterranean coast. The coast of Lebanon and our peninsula have witnessed impressive movements of people, goods, and knowledge that have fuelled prosperity in the Mediterranean region. In particular, Lebanon has attracted goods coming from all over the Middle East, while Italy has traditionally re-directed the flows of products up to northern Europe and toward the rest of the Mediterranean basin. Today, Italy and Lebanon are still in a position to promote this virtuous circle of wealth and progress. Lebanon remains at the crossroads of three continents as well as a main tourist destination. It offers great opportunities in the field of maritime infrastructure. We are looking at the expansion of the ports of Beirut, Tripoli, Jounieh, and Saida, as well as the renovation of the marinas, which offer very interesting prospects. I am sure that a political improvement in the regional environment will surely favor the implementation of these projects, by mobilizing the necessary funds and re-launching trade and tourism in the region.</p><h4>The Italian Cultural Institute in Beirut is an example of how Italy and Lebanon enjoy rich cultural relations. What particular cultural bilateral projects are planned for the near future?</h4><p>Cultural cooperation has always been a must in our relationship. I am deeply convinced of the importance of joint initiatives as they provide invaluable opportunities to strengthen the dialogue between our two peoples. We are linked by shared values. Moreover, the Italian Cultural Institute in Beirut is engaged in tackling the widespread interest in the Italian language in Lebanese society. Language is a key to privilage, providing direct access to culture, and based on that understanding we offer and support Italian language courses in different locations throughout the country. The Italian Cultural Institute also works in close contact with Lebanese educational authorities in order to support the teaching of Italian as a second language in public schools. The Italian Cultural Institute's activities continue with the cooperation of distinguished figures in Lebanon's cultural life, and encompass all kinds of art, such as the Al Bustan Festival and the Liban Jazz Festival.</p><div class="quote">“  For many centuries, Italy and Lebanon have been trading along the Mediterranean coast.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Pesco Telecom evolved since it first entered the Lebanese market?</h4><p>Pesco Telecom was established in 1992 and started as a contractor for large telecoms projects, including satellite earth stations for international communications. In 1997, we moved on to become operators. In the same year, we were granted a license from the government to build and operate a nationwide wireless data network, and this is how we started. With time, we expanded the network and started servicing larger corporate customers that required wide area network (WAN) services. Over the past few decades, in line with growing demand for the internet, we expanded our network to deliver services to ISPs that did not have the license to build their own. Today, we have a customer portfolio that includes corporate customers, who we service directly, as well as all the other ISPs that happen to use our network to deliver internet bandwidth to their customers. We pioneered the first wireless mobile residential network in Lebanon in 2005, known as WISE. By doing so, we moved into the ISP business and finally DSL in 2007. An ISP leases internet deals in terms of buying and selling access and acting as a bridge between the government and the private user. ISP companies in Lebanon are not allowed to build their own infrastructure, and hence must rely on the infrastructure of data service providers.</p><h4>What investment plans do you have for 2014?</h4><p>The lack of a clear regulatory environment makes it impossible for us to plan major investments in the near future. Nevertheless, we will definitely be investing in growing our existing networks.</p><h4>How do you assess the regulatory environment for the ICT sector in the country?</h4><p>It is tough. We are caught in limbo between the full deregulation of the telecoms market and the government monopoly, and the politicization of the sector makes things harder still for us. Despite the fact that a law was approved almost 10 years ago that aimed to privatize and deregulate the sector, it was never fully enacted nor implemented. This state of limbo has a very negative impact on business because long-term visibility of 10-15 years is essential to be able to invest in the telecoms sector, due to the high capital expenditures involved. We are in an unfriendly environment where the de facto licensing regime is not in our favor and the regulatory environment is far from clear. We lobby as hard as possible, but most of the time we are caught in the crossfire. Because of the high politicization of the business, if one party expresses an opinion, the opposition makes a stand and the situation becomes deadlocked. It is nonsense to hold the entire nation hostage to political bickering. A free-from-politics telecoms sector would be beneficial to all parties and to the nation. The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (TRA) tries to do what it can in good faith, but the agency has practically zero enforcement capabilities. It cannot issue rules, much less enforce them.</p><div class="quote">“  I am positive because we are going through a rough patch now, but eventually things will settle down. "</div><h4>How can Lebanon sustain innovation in such a monopolistic environment?</h4><p>There is no doubt in my mind that this is slowing down the whole innovation process and the creation of new business enterprises. The situation is slowing down the economy at a time when growth is most needed in order to make up for the lack of stability, which exacerbates political volatility. The formula for the enhancement of telecoms and internet communications leading to higher GPD growth is obvious. It is pity that we have only registered limited improvement—we could have done much better, but this is typical of Lebanon, a country that has missed so many opportunities.</p><h4>What were Pesco Telecom's results in 2012? What are you expecting for 2013?</h4><p>We are well established in the market, and are managing to post a decent bottom line, but growth is a problem. The whole economy is shrinking and I long for the kind of growth we witnessed a few years ago, when the government was fully committed to the full deregulation of the market.</p><h4>In terms of the drivers of growth, which areas have greater potential?</h4><p>We are experiencing organic growth and the constant and continuous needs of people for more bandwidth. Bandwidth is something that will always be crucial in the sector, and demand can only increase in the future. I have never heard of anyone whose need for bandwidth is decreasing. Regardless of what industry you are in, your need for communications will always rise.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the future of the ICT sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>I am positive because we are going through a rough patch now, but eventually things will settle down and the politicians will ultimately agree on some type of deregulation. Meanwhile, we will continue developing new products and infrastructure despite prevailing constraints, no matter what they are. Lebanon is a very resilient country and its people are very brave. From an economic perspective, business goes on no matter what, and this applies also to the telecoms sector. It is a challenging and dynamic industry where things always change, and where every year introduces new products.</p><h4>What new products have you introduced in 2013?</h4><p>In the last few years, we have introduced a few key services, the biggest one being 3G. The impact could have been better had we been allowed to market it more aggressively, but we are bound by constraints set by the Ministry. We have also introduced many hardware products to the market, such as miniature Wi-Fi routers for 3G dongles and tablet PCs.</p><h4>What would you say are Pesco Telecom's competitive advantages?</h4><p>Our competitive advantage is our excellent team. I am very proud to say that we have one of the best teams in the country; our people are highly skilled engineers who are fully dedicated. Because of our status as a service company, our people are our core assets. We pride ourselves on being a fully transparent company with a high standard of corporate social responsibility, and we try to communicate this to all levels of the hierarchy.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Pesco Telecom?</h4><p>Growth and innovation are the key words. We plan to innovate no matter what the constraints are. We live in a country where it is hard to predict what will happen in the future, but no matter what the givens are, we will work with that status quo and strive to remain the best and the most innovative company. The trick is to adapt to the times that we are going through. Flexibility is crucial in this case. In the private sector, we are probably number two when it comes to size. And as far as reputation and quality of work are concerned, we rank among the best.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How has Net Holding evolved since it was established?<br></h4><p>We started off in 1994 with SkyNet, an international express company employing three people. Starting small, we initially grew through more of a personal pursuit than rationalized decisions to build a business providing much needed service in a post-war Lebanon; it was a period of heavy rebuilding and prosperity. I think it was something I was wired for in terms of my desire to build a new business model for freight and express services in Lebanon and the region. We grew organically and started thinking more strategically.  In 1998, we expanded our line of services to include freight forwarding. As the freight forwarding side of the business developed, we felt the need to separate the two lines and in 2002 we created Net Logistics, a specialized freight forwarding entity handling air, land, sea freight, warehousing, and logistics. With the two lines of business in place, we set out to widen our reach opening up operations into Syria and developing our Syria-Lebanon business. Meanwhile, we worked on developing our brand regionally. As a young company, you are the product of your environment and you should choose that environment very carefully. We wanted to have scale in the areas we chose and Dubai was a very important growth engine for us. We opened our first sales office there in 2007. By 2011 we were implementing a growth strategy, opening in Jordan, another key market of ours. The Iraqi market soon followed suit in that same year where we established operations in Erbil, Basra, and Bagdad. As Net Logistics solidified its Levant base, we started looking at tie ups to ramp up our front end delivery. In 2008, Net Holding signed on for TNT Express representation in Lebanon, a move that propelled Net Holding to be a major express and logistics player in the region. Today, we number more than 175 employees and our company has been growing steadily at an average rate of 40% per year based on a strategic mix of organic and inorganic growth and a carefully thought out market penetration plan. On the local scene, 2007 represented an opportunity for us to be part of the Beirut Port Free Trade, and we opened up our 4,000-sqm warehouse within the zone that same year. It is a project we believe in, despite several setbacks, mainly due to the volatility of our region.</p><h4>What are the advantages of the free zone at the Port of Beirut?</h4><p>Being a Levant-based company, we were keen on seeing the Beirut Sea Port become a gateway to the region; you could say we are foreseeing a mini Jebel Ali Free Zone for Lebanon. With giants like Maersk and CMA bringing large short-transit vessels into Lebanon, we strongly believe in the need for a free zone Levant hub serving Syria, Jordan, and Iraq (Iraq being the biggest market). It is a market that could potentially include more than 50 million people, strengthen economic ties, and facilitate the exchange of goods, capital, and information. We remain very committed to this project despite regional instability, and we are optimistic that things will definitely change given greater stability.</p><h4>What sectors of the economy represent the bulk of your clients?</h4><p>We cater to a wide range of sectors and companies from large multinationals in the oil and gas sectors to specialized tech and telecom firms, right down to retail and individual consumers. In terms of geographic spread, I think of Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan as a single market. While freight movement in Syria at this time is almost at a standstill, we are servicing a large Jordan-based Iraqi community that found itself relocating to Jordan due to the drawn out in-fighting in Iraq. We also service a large client base of Lebanese companies operating out of Jordan and Iraq.</p><div class="quote">“  Being a Levant-based company, we were keen on seeing the Beirut Sea Port become a gateway to the region.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for MENA Capital over the past two years?</h4><p>We have delivered three projects in 2013. In late 2012, we launched a new project called Bella Casa, and we have also expanded our involvement outside of the country, looking to be more involved regionally going forward. Formerly, we were only involved in building high-rise residential projects, but now we are interested in expanding into other sectors and areas that are new to us.</p><h4>What makes Bella Casa different from other projects?</h4><p>Bella Casa is a gated community, on a large tract of land, which is very rare in Beirut, and it will boast amenities that none of the other buildings in the city offer. For example, it has over 5,000 sqm of gardens, a state-of-the-art gym, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, a playground for kids, and a running track. It is basically a place that offers a wonderful lifestyle inside the city.</p><h4>Who is currently buying properties?</h4><p>Mostly younger executives, or people living overseas that want to have property in Lebanon. Also, it is popular with people who want their children to be able to live in Beirut when they get started in their lives. People want somewhere affordable, because prices have risen steadily in recent years.</p><div class="quote">“  I would like us to continue having differentiated investments and projects. "</div><h4>What demand trends can you identify?</h4><p>Many have moved outside of Beirut to compensate for the significant rise in prices over recent years, but have found it impossible to commute into the city because of the traffic. So now people are thinking that if they can find somewhere a bit smaller, but still inside Beirut, then it's a sound option. That is why we are now thinking of building not in the heart of the city, but certainly close to the downtown area. Areas such as Ashrafieh, where Bella Casa is strategically located, are attracting more interest, as it is highly accessible because of its proximity to the highway network, and to key areas around the city. Additionally, as a gated community, it is safe for children to play in. As well, we are very conscious of the need for a green environment. The other thing that is important to people, especially younger executives who may have been exposed to other markets, is quality consciousness. Normally, when you say that you are buying a small apartment, it means that you are buying a commercially constructed apartment in which the finishing materials and quality are not that good. This quality consciousness has become dominant in this group. You cannot just simply provide people with an apartment, even with the amenities that I have discussed. They insist on quality construction, and want to know that a quality job has been done on the building. It does not have to be luxurious, but it does have to be well constructed.</p><h4>How are your international operations evolving, and are you looking at new markets?</h4><p>We have become more involved in the Iraqi market. We have been acquiring land that we hope to be able to develop into different types of projects, be they commercial or residential. Tourist projects are also a possibility.</p><h4>How would you assess the performance of the real estate sector in general in 2013?</h4><p>It has been a weak year, and this is obviously due to the political situation. There is a good chance that it will improve when a government is formed, and that it will truly improve when it becomes clear as to what will happen in our region. Our expectations for oil and gas exploration are obviously a plus, but the government needs to expedite the process, and this is what makes the formation of an effective government so crucial. Everyone seems to be concerned about the fact that there is less construction going on. This is, however, a very strange market. It goes from being virtually inactive to dynamic as soon as positive political action is taken. It has never happened in the past twenty years that people from the Gulf just stop coming here. Since I returned from the US 15 years ago, I have not seen that happen. Even the Lebanese expatriates who used to buy summer homes or family homes have slowed down in their buying habits. Any improvement in the political situation would be favorable, but I do not think that we are going to have a repeat of the period from 2008 to 2010, because there is more supply now. However, once you address this perceived oversupply, prices will begin to improve. The perception on the part of many developers that prices will start to go up again when the political environment improves is not really realistic in my opinion. The first issue that needs to be dealt with concerns supply. Once there is enough demand to begin to account for the supply that is perceived to be there, then there will be an improvement in prices.</p><h4>Despite the political instability of this region at the moment, what are Lebanon's advantages for further investment?</h4><p>Lebanon is a small country, and it went through very difficult times in the past with the civil war. I think people now realize that no one party can dominate the political scene in this country. They can influence it, but they cannot dominate it. And I don't just mean politically. In general, no one wants a return to the idea of forcing one's ideas on another through the use of arms. People realize that it is not a viable option, and this is a unique point about Lebanon. Other countries have not been through what we have, and so are resorting to these tactics, as in Syria. I think that the oil and gas sector could be a major advantage for the country, because if people are economically comfortable, they do not need to look beyond their country for funding or capital, something that may force them to choose political ties that they otherwise would not. I think that once we move closer to oil and gas exploitation, people will focus more on the economy.</p><h4>Where would you like to see MENA Capital in the medium term?</h4><p>I would like us to continue having differentiated investments and projects. We are seen as quality-conscious, and always bring something different and fresh to the market. We want to pursue sectors that offer this difference. I think that we are perceived as location-conscious in our real estate developments, and that we select good designs for our projects. In addition, the amenities that we provide are well appreciated, and certainly differentiate us in the market. We always look to introduce new features and technologies in our business, and going forward would like to be more complete in terms of what we develop, from residential to commercial to resorts, ultimately adding something special to the market. I just hope we can have a more peaceful future for this beautiful country.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been H.E.C's major milestones over the past two years?</h4><p>It is a little tricky to specify milestones in just a few words. The real estate business is exotic and in perpetual movement, bridging the past to the present and to the future. However, besides high-tech project developments, H.E.C has embarked on a joint venture with the private banking sector to create a real estate fund portfolio, which will be advantageous for other investors to join the real estate sector from a return-on-investment perspective. In Lebanon, whoever has the necessary funds, as well as the right architects and contractors, can start off in the building business. The fund we are working on setting up is managed by one of the top banks in Lebanon. It will offer a portfolio of various funds for people who are interested in diversification. With this venture, we are trying to control the market, to a certain extent, and avoid the situation similar to the one seen in Dubai, where the private sector and the government have all been engaged in the building process and it turns out to be chaos. Actually, there is a committee for the real estate developers, and most of the major companies acting in Lebanon, including H.E.C, have joined. We hope that through it, we will be able to work out some fundamental regulations for the real estate sector. Of our other business achievements, we have expanded the manufacturing facilities of two H.E.C subsidiaries, one factory for H.E.C Wood and another for H.E.C Aluminum. We have equipped them with new machinery, brought in new architects, a larger workforce, and have even undertaken joint ventures with other architects and interior designers.</p><h4>What impact has all of this had on your business?</h4><p>Aside from the benefits of the fund portfolio, that expansion will push us further to have better architectural designs and engineering standards. Locally, Lebanon cannot compete with the world's manufacturing market, as our costs are too high to sustain due to the lack of government support. We, however, can supply a great deal of good quality, value-added products and specialized customizations. This is our added value. Most of us travel a lot, so we are always searching for the latest innovations in manufacturing machines, for example. We are not doing mass production. We import our materials from Germany and Italy, and we are looking into Spain now. We were investigating Turkey, but because of the recent unrest, it is now not a possibility.</p><h4>As a long-standing expert in the real estate field, how do you perceive it performing in Lebanon? What are the trends in the long run?</h4><p>It is witnessing tight times and a slowdown recently because of the troubles in Syria, which have tremendously affected its progress, not to mention the worldwide economic crisis. The major problem has been Syria, as most of our business goes there and comes back. There are also restrictions in the banking sector, which means we cannot bring in Syrian money. That has greatly influenced our purchasing power. Despite this, we have two ongoing projects: one at Nabay, near Rabieh, and another at Mansourieh. The Nabay development we have dubbed “Greenville." It is about 200 to 300 apartments, consisting of close to 20 to 30 buildings in one area, with security networks, management, and everything involved. We are also working on a deal with Cablevision cable providers to supply satellite TV and internet access to residents, but this is not closed yet. We are still carrying on our negotiations, and expect to reach an agreement sometime in 2016.</p><h4>Which buyer segment does H.E.C target its projects at?</h4><p>They are aimed at middle-income earners, a market currently doing well. We are developing apartments ranging from 80 sqm to 170 sqm; this is the demand now. The Nabay project was supposed to be at Roumieh, but due to municipality issues, we moved it to Nabay. In this project, we are working on kids' playgrounds and common areas. There will be a 300-400 sqm area that residents can book and use for social activities. There are small apartments as well, so it will be necessary to use these spaces for big family dinners. The second project development at Mansourieh we called “Rosewood." Construction has already started, and we will have 59 apartments, of areas 100 sqm to 240 sqm. This residence is the perfect area and it is working for us. We are also good at aiding the financing of homes. We are now offering facilities with only a 10% downpayment, up to 90% financing over 30 years, and a fixed interest rate of 2.5%. This is a first for Lebanon, as it is usually around 6.5%.</p><h4>How do you assess the building permits situation in Lebanon?</h4><p>It is a nightmare. The government is too busy playing the role of a “government" that it has forgotten to facilitate people's occupations, whatever business they are involved in. Usually and unfortunately, in Lebanon the more you get to know influential people, the easier you get your work done and not have to deal with the ridiculous and exhausting bureaucracy. This is how it is, and you have to work around these problems. Greenville was supposed to be at Roumieh, but the mayor stopped the project for a very poor reason; one corner of the entire project exceeded a certain height limit. Normally, across the world, a $42 million project like the supposed Roumieh would not be blocked for something so trivial. I had to refund clients' money and apologize, and the mayor did not care about our situation. His main alibi, he has claimed, is that he wants to keep the area green, but where the irony lies in all that, H.E.C Green is the main sponsor of Lebanon Green Again. I assisted in planting more than 2 million sqm of trees, so for me, it is an outrageous excuse.</p><h4>How is the prefabricated house segment of the business developing?</h4><p>It is developing well. We started H.E.C HOMES in 2012, and sold our first project to Ricky's restaurant in Faraya. It is not just us engaged in this now. Many are doing a good job, offering high-quality prefabricated projects. In our case, because we can offer a variety of services due to our many business interests, we are in a better position in this market. Ricky's is our main project, a 650-sqm restaurant that has worked out really well. We are now moving toward chalets. The benefits here are that you can have a new house in less than five months, instead of the usual two to three years in Lebanon. You save 60% on energy, and they are eco-friendly and green. We mainly import these from Finland, Russia, Canada, and the US.</p><h4>What have been the latest advancements that you have accomplished?</h4><p>Last year was somewhat stagnant because we had had lots of problems, such as with the internet service in the country. We cannot do many things, and our communications infrastructure is extremely inadequate. We cannot proceed with any new technologies related to the internet and applied to the construction business because of this, and all major developments are in this area. Now, we are trying to focus on eco-friendly solutions, instead. We are introducing these standards into many of our new projects.</p><h4>What are your expectations for the Ducati Brand?</h4><p>In 2013, we have acquired the Ducati dealership, collaborating and partnering with the Ducati CEO/Partner in Lebanon, Gilbert Khoury, a mechanical engineer and graduate of MIT. He also works with Michelin tires, so this is a good business for us. In the next three years, we will target three or four sub-dealers in Lebanon. It is a completely different business for us, and moving from the construction to the automotive sector has been interesting.</p><h4>Are you considering getting into new markets?</h4><p>We are looking into Erbil in Iraq, as well as Georgia. We are studying these markets, but our Georgian operations are a bit more advanced. It is mainly linked to our kitchen manufacturing operations and the Ducati dealership. We are looking into creating franchises there.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for Aya, due for completion in 2015, and why did you choose Mar Mikhael as a location?</h4><p>When we first purchased the land in Mar Mikhael, the area was very poor; however, we believed that there was huge potential in this street because of the alignment of old houses and buildings and the atmosphere. We believed that we could sell a high-end project in this kind of area. We have very few offices and 44 apartments. We have already sold 70% of the project. We do not sell our retail spaces; we rent them. We have around 2,000 sqm of retail space that we are trying to develop into a dynamic area. Hence, we created a pedestrian “piezetta" in the center of the project, meaning people can walk around and enjoy coffee shops and restaurants. The architecture of the project is unique; it was designed by a French architect who took into consideration the urban aspect of the street. We tried to position the building in such a way to maximize views and spaces. There are two things that make this building stand out: preserving the original facade of the building currently on site and integrating it with the new building, which was really a challenge. The other challenge was how to build a tower that was not intrusive and in a way that reduced its visual impact on the street.</p><h4>In what ways is Har Properties committing to sustainability?</h4><p>When we started in Aya, I wanted it to be a green building. So, I contacted the LEED operator in Lebanon, and we decided to go green. There were only two or three buildings with this certificate. It is a challenge because there are many aspects that unfortunately cannot be avoided. The first being the electric generators, which are the biggest source of pollution. In order to get LEED Certification, there are a certain number of achievements that need to be reached, such as the white facade and the double-glazing, which helped us get our green building certification. However, for other developers, it can be a challenge to get this far.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Beirut's cityscape?</h4><p>The authorities have to work on the urbanization of Beirut, because there is no plan. Few developers are sensitive to the aesthetics of architecture; most of them do not care and are only concerned about profit. When your concern is profit, you do not care about the look of the city and the authorities do not control this. It really is a mess, and I hope that they work on an urban plan for Beirut to avoid more of the bad construction that you can see in the city. However, there are a few developers that do try to create pleasing projects, green buildings, and even contribute to the infrastructure in the area.</p><h4>What are your expectations for Upark, and what makes this project different?</h4><p>Many developers count on the diaspora, and for many years we tried to avoid the local Lebanese sector and target the diaspora; however, now we are targeting the Lebanese at home and we try to attract them here as well. That is why the size of apartments is smaller, because the purchasing power of local Lebanese is much less than the Lebanese living abroad. We try to encourage Lebanese expatriates to return and buy small apartments. This is why in one of our projects, Upark, we have started selling 76-sqm apartments, which is a studio apartment in Europe, although it is a little bigger than a studio in Paris, for example. Upark also has a 2,500-sqm garden. It is a very interesting project that we are trying to promote in a new area, which was previously an industrial zone. If you think of the evolution of London and New York, much of those cities were once industrial areas that have transformed into residential areas. We are trying to do the same for this area.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What are your expectations for the Waterfront City project?<br></h4><p>Waterfront City is a major residential, commercial, and hospitality project. It is actually made up of two major projects, the first being a joint venture between Majid Al Futtaim (MAF) Lebanon Holding and Joseph G. Khoury et Fils Holding, which spans an excess of 193,000 sqm of land. This development combines residential and commercial units, a world-class office park, and a five-star hotel. It is practically a city in itself. This is complemented by a second mixed-use project to be developed solely by MAF on approximately 55,000 sqm of land, which extends and complements the first project by providing a mall, retail, food and beverage offerings, a residential complex, and a business hotel to international standards that complements the nearby Metn Convention Center and answers to the needs of business travelers and shoppers alike. It is an excellent opportunity for us to implement our corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and offer our environmentally friendly products to the public. As with Beirut City Centre, the new mall to be developed in this location will house a Carrefour hypermarket, as well as our family entertainment center offerings that include VOX Multiplex theatre and Magic Planet, in addition to other international and local brands.</p><h4>When will Waterfront City be completed?</h4><p>This is a major project to begin with, and to actually design and build over 500,000 sqm of a mixed-use development represents a major challenge to any developer on the local or international scene. There are several constraints as far as how fast you can develop such a capital project, first and foremost being local and regional stability, coupled with market maturity and the absorption rate, as well as the availability of experienced contractors that have the technical expertise and financial capabilities to handle and deliver projects of this magnitude. Being aware of these constraints, we are releasing this project in phases. We have launched Phase I and I-A, and the responses have been encouraging; we are getting ready to release Phase II, to be followed by the eventual launch of Phase III. As this is an integrated development, it is not based on cashing in on off-plan sales of residential units, rather by introducing the necessary drivers to create a lifestyle that is befitting of the most prestigious development on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Thus, the imminent introduction of the office park concept and the announcement of the five-star hotel, which should frame-in this development, will set it off on the right track toward its timely completion.</p><h4>How many residential spaces will Waterfront City have and what is the size range?</h4><p>There are several factors that come into play when determining the number and size of units in a residential development. We started out with Phase I and Phase I-A, where units offered ranged in size from 85 sqm to over 600 sqm. In Phase II, we introduced units that were between 90 sqm and 400 sqm. At the end of the day, market demands and dynamics will come into play in determining the end product. People will always be looking for quality and choices, and our offer is designed to cater to their tastes and needs.</p><h4>What is the average buyer profile?</h4><p>Currently, over 90% of the people that have purchased residential units in Waterfront City are Lebanese, and 93% of those are actually living in Lebanon. The remaining 7% are Lebanese expatriates. This is a further testimony to the fact that people really believe in this project and a clear indication of it is their primary choice of residence.</p><h4>How are your international operations evolving?</h4><p>We have a strong commitment to the region. We are present practically throughout all of the GCC countries and are expanding into the MENA region. We currently have 12 major commercial centers spread across the major cities within the GCC, Egypt, and Lebanon, with major residential/community developments being realized throughout the region, in addition to several new hotels that are being developed to add to the company's current portfolio of 3,000 four- and five-star hotel rooms. The intent is to lay the groundwork to meet the founder's vision and expand through careful planning while being true to the company's motto to “Lead by Example."</p>]]></richbody0content>

It is performing well, although we have had difficult times in terms of tourism. Fortunately, we intended the destination to serve the young, middle-class Lebanese or professionals, just to create an outlet where they could go to eat something or get a cup of coffee. It is an environment that is very much in the center of town, but when you go there, you feel as though you are somewhere else. It has been good. This is an outdoor, all-day destination. This is something you need to be able to use all day to make sense, operationally. You cannot have a place for only a couple of hours in the evening where people come for a drink after work.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the yacht club?</h4><p>We are going to have a private environment for members and their guests. It is being furnished right now. We will have an association with European yacht clubs, so we will have people who can stay here and those members can enjoy each other's locations. We were hoping to have a grand opening for the whole project, including the yacht club, in the spring of 2013; however, the contractors were late and many elements are taking time to put in place. We have also attached to it a really good Lebanese restaurant—probably the best one we have in this country. It is an open-terrace type of approach with an open grill. It will be a little funky as well.</p><h4>In terms of marina and waterfront developments, what is your outlook?</h4><p>We have another project, but we are putting it on the backburner. It will be around 40,000 sqm in the south of Beirut. The shape of the marina will be round and large, so you can be on the breakwater. We have designed it carefully, though the final design is very different. It will have a small tower and a clubhouse. There will also be some villas. It will be all green with no cars driving in the area. It is in our head for the time being, but we are going to get the permits. It is different from Zaitunay Bay; it is very much a residential development with facilities and clubs. It is very much geared toward permanent residency. We have some leisure facilities in the form of a club, but it is about creating special residential environments, really. It is not going to be cheap. My personal dream is that we become an exciting part of the Mediterranean list. We can do that. It is not because of the huge coastline, but because we love service, we love to create things, we love to be hospitable, we love visitors, and we love the freedom of life.</p><div class="quote">“  My personal dream is that we become an exciting part of the Mediterranean list. "</div><h4>How do you assess the process of getting permits in Lebanon?</h4><p>It is 40 years behind the times. The bureaucracy is not very encouraging. Actually, there was one government official who told me that our problem in the private sector is that we speak different languages. When I asked what he meant, he said that when we bring them something for permits, they interpret it the same way they would have 50 years ago. They do not ask for a disk or electronic designs; they want signs and drawings.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What has been C.A.T. Group's historic role in the contracting sector in the 20th century?</h4><p>The C.A.T. Group, founded in 1937 by Emile Bustani and his partners Abdallah El Khoury and Shukri Shammas, played a significant and proud role in the history of 20th century contracting, experiencing the turmoil of the Middle East, while preserving its culture of excellence. Our group has a spirit and tradition, values its employees, and provides them with the best working environment even in very difficult and unsafe areas. When C.A.T. was established, there were no Lebanese contractors and, in the late 1950s, C.A.T. became the biggest contracting company in the MENA region. We were also the first family business in the Middle East run by professional management, and not by the families or shareholders themselves. The mission of the C.A.T. Group is to offer a wide range of integrated engineering, procurement, and construction services based on up-to-date knowledge, quality assurance, safety, quality workmanship, cost awareness, and on-time delivery. Our group operates in diverse sectors, such as oil and gas, pipeline, mechanical, buildings, civil engineering, and roads.</p><h4>How are C.A.T. Group's international operations developing?</h4><p>After more than 75 years, C.A.T. Group still has an eminent presence in the GCC, the Middle East, and Africa, thanks to its culture of excellence and its commitment to providing the best services to its clients. In Saudi Arabia, we successfully completed important projects in the oil and gas, mechanical, and pipeline sectors and we have an important portfolio of ongoing projects for Aramco, Maaden, and many other clients. Our strong presence in Nigeria allows us to execute significant volumes of civil works, such as roads, highways, bridges, and water plants in many states. Qatar is also an important market for C.A.T. Group since we have completed prestigious projects there, such as one of the world's largest district cooling plants executed on a design and build basis; the Integrated District Cooling Plant (IDCP), which was installed in The Pearl Qatar in 2010 and which will service more than 80 apartment towers, beachfront villas, townhouses, shopping complexes, offices, schools, and hotels throughout the island, ultimately supplying more than 130,000 tons of refrigeration to the island's estimated 50,000 residents in the Porto Arabia project in The Pearl Qatar. We are currently closing on three of the main central utility plants for the New Doha International Airport as well as the Doha Land Infrastructure Works for Msheireb Properties. In the UAE, we are working in the oil and gas, pipelines, and heavy mechanical sectors. We have successfully built several district cooling plants in the UAE. The C.A.T. Group is also active in Kuwait. In addition, our presence in Basra in Iraq allows us to target important projects in the oil and gas and pipeline sectors. Over the past few years, we have also completed a number of noteworthy projects in Lebanon, including the Marina Towers, the An Nahar Building, and the Lebanese Order of Physicians' headquarters.</p><h4>How do you assess Lebanon's construction sector?</h4><p>Lebanon's construction sector experienced an overall decline of around 11.7 % in 2012 relative to 2011. The construction sector in Lebanon is widely relying on private real estate developments. Public projects in Lebanon are very rare and are put on hold mainly because the government does not have the budget to fund them. The government has made no significant investments in infrastructure, though Lebanon badly needs to improve its infrastructure and build power plants to cover the country's needs in electricity, water treatment, and solid waste management to preserve our environment, which is seriously threatened. It also needs to double sustainable energy projects to reduce the country's dependence on oil and natural gas. In my opinion, cooperation between the public and private sectors can help the government to overcome this impasse. However, without a well-defined and clear legal and financial framework, recognition of shared interests and balanced contract risk allocation, the public-private partnership (PPP) cannot be successful.</p><h4>What has been the focus of your growth strategy in recent years, and where do you see more potential for the company to grow?</h4><p>Although we are living in a politically unstable region where nobody knows what will happen next, as was the case in Egypt, Libya, Iraq, and Tunisia, the region still has high potential. Accordingly, we continue to focus on areas of business wherein we already have a presence, and at the same time we are looking to develop our expertise and know-how in others regions, such as Africa and Eastern Europe. The Group's leadership, culture, vision, efficient financial management, risk management, systems and procedures, and high-level skill have always helped our group's businesses achieve their potential.</p><h4>What are C.A.T. Group's competitive advantages?</h4><p>The competitive advantages of the C.A.T. Group results from matching core competencies to the opportunities offered to us. C.A.T. Group has a unique history and a culture that allow us to create an edge over our competitors. C.A.T.'s solid reputation is underpinned by its firm commitment to provide the best services to its clients, based on quality, safety, and timely delivery. We consistently seek to meet or even exceed our clients' expectations, which in turn enable us to establish long-term relationships with them. Our intentional emphasis on quality and transparency keeps us on the right track with subcontractors and suppliers, which we consider on the same level as our real partners. We are also distinguished because we invest in our people, our most valuable assets; we respect and appreciate them.</p><h4>How has C.A.T. Group managed to transfer its success to so many different markets?</h4><p>The secrets of the success of the C.A.T. Group are its culture of excellence and the commitment of its people to deliver, most of the time, in very difficult areas. The C.A.T. culture provides the key by opening up to new markets, which ultimately results in our flexibility from one region to another, supported by unwavering corporate standards, system, and policies. Being deeply rooted, we have the ability to deal with different types of clients, adapting ourselves to their culture, needs, and expectations. Dealing with GCC clients may differ considerably from dealing with Nigerian or other African clients. For example, for some clients, safety is of prime concern, while for others cost may be a more important element. We are also very transparent in the way we share information, and achieve considerable synergy between our departments, divisions, and areas, all of which are very important. Success is gradually built by learning from one's own mistakes.</p><h4>Where do you see the construction sector in Lebanon developing over the next decade, and where do you envision C.A.T. Group?</h4><p>For the construction sector, it is very hard to say and is unpredictable as it does not only depend on the situation in Lebanon, but also in the region as a whole. Without stability, you cannot develop a country, and Lebanon must achieve its stability once and for all and I am optimistic that one day Lebanon will once again fully utilize its ingenuity. As for C.A.T. Group, I am confident that we will continue on the path laid down by its founders Emile Bustani, Abdallah El Khoury, and Shukri Shammas as we are still willing to grow further by opening up new markets, and without a shadow of doubt we are keen on working in Lebanon again. As such, we are targeting some important projects in the construction sector as well as in the oil and gas sector since we are already prequalified to participate in the tenders of the offshore and onshore works. My main objectives as CEO of the C.A.T. Group are to preserve our culture and spirit of excellence, to maintain our leadership position among the major players in the GCC and MENA region, to remain committed to delivering and meeting our clients expectations, to invest in our people and develop their skills, to continue working in a spirit of partnership and maintain transparency, and, last but not least, to enhance the group's financial strength and create wealth for our shareholders.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How have the banks managed to contain the negative impact of the political situation in the region?</h4><p>The regional situation is not encouraging for investment or consumption. Lebanon is in the midst of the Middle East, and whatever is happening around us has an influence on the behavior of people in our country. The major challenge that we had to encounter, and we succeeded in doing so, was to maintain confidence in our banking sector, and our currency. That confidence has helped the country to once again preserve stability. We were negatively impacted in terms of the rate of growth, which is now running at around 2.5% per year, having fallen from 8%. Nevertheless, compared to other countries in the region, we are still doing well. Lebanon has undergone many difficulties in the past, but stability was preserved, and, therefore, we have developed more resilience. Of course there are risks, but the rewards in Lebanon are there to compensate for that risk. By letting the market forces determine the prices of assets in the country as well as interest rates, we have created a risk-reward profile that has prevailed, helping the country to proceed.</p><h4>Which segments of the economy benefit most from the Banque du Liban's stimulus package?</h4><p>Our main objective is to stimulate internal demand. Because of the prevailing situation in the Middle East, external demand has decreased. The central bank has a strong balance sheet, and it is, therefore, capable of implementing incentive programs to help the local economy develop. The stimulus package aimed at increasing growth by 2%, and was dedicated to housing, new projects, especially in SMEs, R&amp;D for energy substitution projects, the environment, and university studies. We will continue to monitor our markets, and whenever needed will come up with new financial stimulus packages. We are presently working on a stimulus project for startups, especially in the knowledge industry.</p><h4>How can the Banque du Liban further stimulate the economy and control inflation?</h4><p>Through the management of liquidity we can control inflation. Our economic models determine the optimal liquidity needed to maintain a healthy economic growth. The excess liquidity is taken out of the market by the central bank to target an inflation rate below 4%.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the performance of the banking sector in the first half of 2013, and what do you expect for the next six months?</h4><p>The banking sector in Lebanon is healthy. We were able to go through major crises in places where our banks were operating, such as Syria, Egypt, and Cyprus. The growth of deposits in 2013 is more than 7%, and we believe that they will yield profits that are equal to, or better than, 2012. We are not expecting any negative news in the market, as we have already instituted the necessary provisions for the exposure of our banks regionally. Our banks are well capitalized, and the central bank stipulated a solvency ratio of 10% at the end of 2012, based on the Basel III resolution. This was achieved, and we have asked for a 12% solvency ratio by 2015, also based on Basel III. That will put our sector, in terms of capitalization, at a higher ratio than required by Basel III.</p><h4>What does it mean for the Lebanese to be ahead of the curve on implementing Basel III?</h4><p>It means more confidence for the banking sector, and therefore more capital inflows. Lebanon is financed through its local markets, because our rating is low. Lebanon has a B rating due to its political and security risks. Therefore, the more funds that you can draw into the country, the more funds you have available to fuel the economy, and the more you can preserve acceptable levels of interest rates. Although Lebanon is rated B, it has interest rates that are equivalent to countries that are rated BBB.</p><h4>What steps are being taken to reduce the budget and trade deficits?</h4><p>The trade deficit is a historical fact with Lebanon. We cover that by remittances. The Lebanese work more beyond Lebanon than within it. They transfer assets to the country, and this has been Lebanon's history since its independence in 1945. The country does not really have sectors that can export and, even though we have discovered gas, we currently lack commodities to export. The Lebanese economy is relying on the human factor. The Lebanese who travel all over the world still have an attachment to their homeland, and they send their money here. This helps the country to find the necessary funding for its imports. This structure will be maintained, and we have to sustain confidence in the banks, because if that is lacking, people will not transfer money into the country.</p><h4>How would you assess the country's financial confidentiality?</h4><p>Lebanon has bank secrecy laws, but, as the world is changing, we also have other laws to ensure transparency and good governance in our sector. The bank secrecy law is maintained, but does not prevail in the case of money laundering. Currently, Parliament is discussing a law that would suspend bank secrecy in cases of tax evasion.</p><h4>What measures have been taken to tighten bank supervision following the Lebanese-Canadian Bank issue?</h4><p>What happened with the Lebanese-Canadian Bank has happened with banks outside Lebanon, too. It is essentially linked to the fact that the US considers that when you are using their currency, you also have to abide by their laws. This bank was accused by the US of the infringement of US laws, and there was a settlement of the case lately with the US government, whereby the bank paid a fine of $102 million, and the case was closed. Nevertheless, the Banque du Liban has taken measures to make sure that we have the proper legal structure to not experience such incidences again. The banking sector is very important for the Lebanese economy, and a problem at any bank in Lebanon could create economic or social crisis. The most important circular we issued is that the banks here have to respect the laws and sanctions of other countries when using the currency of these countries, or when dealing with the banks of these countries. The banks here are abiding by that. On the other side, the Special Investigation Commission (SIC), which is the body that fights money laundering, is doing the utmost to make sure that business is being done properly.</p><h4>What is the central bank doing to make sure Lebanon regains its status as the financial hub for the region?</h4><p>Today, Lebanon has developed its banking sector, not only in terms of size, but also in terms of sophistication. We have requested the banks to have new discipline in their work, and have encouraged them to improve their systems. You could say that Lebanon has a banking sector that is on an international level, and regionally attractive for business in the Arab world. We are currently working to develop our capital markets, and are heading toward a situation where the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) will become a private company. The regulators will be ensuring that there is good governance, no manipulation, and no insider trading. And, we want to go further still by creating a financial center that would be off-system, where it is easy to open a business, and that would also be coupled with incubators that would allow Beirut to become an address for those keen on startups. This all takes time, but we are working hard. I am also the head of the Capital Markets Authority, the central bank, and SIC, the anti-money laundering body.</p><h4>What is your economic outlook for Lebanon in 2013 and in the medium term?</h4><p>Lebanon is difficult to predict because of the political- and security-related volatility. Nevertheless, the track record of the country has shown that, despite these obstacles that have sometimes been tragic, resulting in war and assassinations, we have seen improvements in our GDP, and in the figures of the financial sector. Also, we have seen improvements in tourism and construction. I have confidence in the potential of the Lebanese, and the way they approach their business has taken into consideration the volatility and insecurity that we could potentially see. I believe that Lebanon will see continued growth that could either be moderate, as today, or much higher, given a better economic climate. Of course, we need to have a government that would invest greater effort into developing the nation's infrastructure.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have Demco Steel Industries' milestones been over the past year?</h4><p>We have shifted our interest from the steel industry to various other sectors over the past few years. Real estate in Lebanon has become one of our main businesses. We have also expanded our shipping business overseas. And while we have maintained our position as market leader in the Lebanese steel market, we do believe that diversification is the key to growth today.</p><h4>What type of real estate developments are you involved in?</h4><p>We have several projects that mainly consist of small-scale housing in very interesting residential buildings, including some products unique to the country. In our latest launch with RedRock Village &amp; Spa project, we are creating an entire village in the Faqra mountains with a spa, a farm, solar panels, and bio waste facilities. There is huge interest from the Lebanese people in this kind of development, and so we're starting to develop in this area and have done very well. We sold more than half the project in three days, and it is a very large one. We are beginning work to lay down the necessary infrastructure as we speak, and are set to start the construction of the project in April 2014.</p><h4>What makes the RedRock Village &amp; Spa project different?</h4><p>The initial RedRock master plan was designed by Foster &amp; Partners in London, one of the best architectural firms in the world. The total area of the project is 500,000 sqm, of which 250,000 sqm will be dedicated to public gardens and roads. We are ready to lose more than 50% of the potential exploitation to make sure we keep a maximum amount of green areas and a beautiful landscape for RedRock residents. This non-commercial approach, which is something we are very proud of, will definitely be a first in Lebanon. We are building exclusive high-end chalets, where families will live in apartments ranging from 50 sqm to 130 sqm in size. There will also be gardens and individual swimming pools. The farm is key to the project as it will provide a place for families to experience a healthy lifestyle with daily products such as eggs, dairy products, and fresh organic vegetables. Furthermore, we will have facilities to provide numerous sports activities within the sports club in the spa or natural jogging track/hiking trail in the forest. Despite the current instability we are faced with, this is yet another example that specially tailored projects will sell out irrespective of political stability. An “outside the box" approach combined with our unique products are the main reasons why we sold more than 1,000 apartments/offices in various projects, enabling Demco Real Estate in partnership with Sayfco's excellent marketing team to become market leaders within a very short time.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the demand for apartments?</h4><p>In Europe 50 years ago, many people were accustomed to live in apartments of 200 sqm-300 sqm. Today, people live on average in 70 sqm residences because prices are much higher. People want smaller places in good locations and with excellent facilities, but they cannot afford large apartments. Five years ago, I started a small apartment project in the Metn area of Beirut, with units of 122 sqm. It was a huge success. At that time, we were the first to develop 100-sqm apartments. In fact, we sold all of the 122-sqm units in record time, with the 166-sqm units selling out immediately after. People want to be very close to Beirut, but cannot afford to be in the heart of the city because it is too expensive.</p><h4>What other projects are you working on?</h4><p>We are working on three towers on the coastal highway, including 30- to 45-story buildings. That was also different in the sense that the highest building on the highway is currently seven or eight stories high. People never liked to live high up, but due to today's demographics there is an increasing demand for this kind of housing unit. With land being so expensive the only thing you can do is to erect higher buildings. These apartments have magnificent 360° views of Beirut city and the Mediterranean Sea. None of the available projects have these facilities and views at these price levels. There is a market for the right product, and there is adequate liquidity in the country. The banks in Lebanon are fully liquid and need to lend to their customers who are looking for the right products.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the shipping business?</h4><p>Today, shipping has changed. First of all, the last two or three years have been extremely difficult for the shipping business because of the global recession. I believe that the US and Europe are beginning to emerge. Although there are still many issues to overcome, I am convinced that one year from now things will start kicking in again. We have ordered a few large ships. These are ships that save around 30% of fuel over the previous models, and that have a capacity to move 30% more goods. Their new design enables them to go faster than previous models. They can trade anywhere in the world, which is another way of diversifying our assets. The main play was based on the reality that the market today is very bad, with very low ship prices, though with new technology for better ships emerging. When you save 30% on fuel, you are basically saving about $1 million per ship per year on energy costs alone. We are selling off the old assets and replacing them with new ones. The new ship designs will eventually be so much more competitive that they will make the rest of the world's fleet obsolete. This new approach should result in a significant increase for our shipping business.</p><h4>How is the steel market performing in Lebanon?</h4><p>To this date, the quantities of steel that are being demanded in the country are the same in 2013 as they were in 2012. That was a surprise; we had expected demand to drop due to a slowdown in the economy. I don't expect the 2nd Quarter of 2014 to be the same, and am anticipating a slowdown over the coming months. The price of steel is set by the international market, and not the Lebanese market. Therefore, what happens in the construction sector in Lebanon affects the demand for steel; however, it doesn't affect the price. The main problem that we are having today is that there is a lot of competition between players in the steel business. The margins are very slim and interest in growing a business with such margins and very little added value is falling. Hence, this is the reason why we are focusing most of our energy on other sectors.</p><h4>What is your vision for Demco Steel Industries?</h4><p>The biggest obstacle in proper forecasting is the political situation in Lebanon today. Visibility in this country varies very quickly. It is very difficult to be able to tell you where I see Demco in the near future because most of our activities are still regional, or within Lebanon itself. We have a plant in Syria that is operating at 20% capacity in light of the ongoing civil war. Hopefully, with some efforts from the international community in resolving the Syrian tragedy, we will be able to be part of the reconstruction process and enable MedSteel to produce at full capacity again. We estimate steel demand to be north of 2 million tons/year, of which we can easily supply 50% of the local steel sector. I believe that turmoil in the region will not last as long as people think; in the modern world everything evolves quickly. There will be a period of adjustment, but if we emerge from this uncertainty, we will be sure to grow substantially.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How did the launch of your Turkish subsidiary Odeabank go, and how will it help expand Bank Audi's regional presence?</h4><p>Over the last few years, the most important development in the group was the launch of its Turkish subsidiary. We have been very lucky in Turkey to have been granted the first license in 14 years, so we are stepping in without incurring any goodwill. Having the luxury of being granted a license and entering a market without paying goodwill provides you with important flexibility in acquiring top-notch people, investing in the best technology, and acquiring all the necessary means to deploy your business plan. We are not just establishing a presence in Turkey to have another subsidiary; we have chosen Turkey on the basis of its strong fundamentals, and our strategy is to build in Turkey a subsidiary that would rank second to Lebanon in terms of assets and earnings on a three-to-five-year horizon. We have an appetite for growth and have built a business model that, in principle, should lead to scale in Turkey. Turkey provides a huge opportunity given its sizeable economy in terms of population and GDP and its significant engagement in the exponentially increasing trade, finance, and human flows between Turkey and the Arab world, including countries in which our group is present.</p><h4>What have been your results in Turkey so far?</h4><p>On November 1, 2012 we officially launched the business. In seven months, we have been able to go from a greenfield operation starting from scratch to building a deposit base that represents close to a 1% market share in Turkey. To give you some benchmarks, two of the most successful foreign banks in Turkey, which are European banks having on average 22-25 years of presence, each have a market share in deposits of 2.5%. We were able to achieve 40% of the market share of those prominent European banks in just seven months of activity.</p><h4>What is behind this success?</h4><p>At the end of the day, banking is about people. Banking is considered to be a capital-intensive business because, by definition, banks are subject to capital ratios. However, I believe it is a much more labor-intensive business because it is about relationships: acquiring customers and managing business relationships. Our competitive strength in Turkey is that we have acquired the best people. We have a very high-quality management team, with 10-15 years of experience on average. We got on board very well-established relationship managers, who enjoyed a deep-rooted knowledge of the Turkish customers and market. They were recruited from prime banks in Turkey with very important customer and account portfolios, and this has translated into franchise acquisition.</p><h4>How would you assess the current performance of the Lebanese financial sector?</h4><p>In order to have a good empirical assessment of the financial industry in Lebanon, it is better to start with the statistical experience. I believe statistical historical experiences are as important as empirical ones in assessing any business or industry. Lebanon has gone through very difficult times over the last 20-25 years. I am talking about the post-war era, which entailed the post-reconstruction period, the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri, the summer war with Israel in 2006, and so on. All throughout this period, the Lebanese banking industry showed a great deal of resilience. The performance of the financial sector in Lebanon has been consistently disconnected from that of the real sector. When we have a changing business environment, it affects the real sector much more quickly than the financial sector. The real sector has a limited resilience, depending on the magnitude of change in the environment. But despite the adverse trends we may have witnessed, the impact on the financial industry has been very limited at all times.</p><h4>What factors have contributed to this resilience?</h4><p>In figures, we have been able to add $76 billion in deposits in Lebanon since the assassination of Prime Minister Hariri in 2005, and $53 billion since the outbreak of the global financial crisis. From time to time there is a small drop, but it then catches up and the overall trend is noticeable growth. There is a very high correlation between this resilience and being so-called boring banks. As a matter of fact, boring banks have been the most resilient throughout the global turmoil. A boring bank is generally a deposit-rich bank, a retail bank, and a bank whose funding comes almost exclusively from customer deposits. On the back of strong fiduciary responsibility, the use we make of these deposits is a very careful one, particularly if this funding comes from customers who our branch managers know almost all personally. On the loan side, Lebanese bank lending is short-term, revolving around working capital financing and trade finance with huge guarantees, with a limited share for long-term finance and project finance. When we lend it is mainly to defensive and immune businesses; very little to volatile businesses. Normally we lend a maximum of 50% of our customers' deposits. The remainder we keep in immediate and available liquidity with central banks and our correspondent banks, and in a portfolio of securities. We are considered boring banks because our balance sheet is so transparent; you do not need an expert in order to understand how clean it is, how liquid it is, and what quality there is in the bank's assets.</p><h4>What is your view of the central bank's stimulus package, and what segments are going to benefit from this?</h4><p>Those are coincidental measures. The Governor of the Banque du Liban is a wise man and very experimental, and his duties include boosting economic activity, being responsible for monetary and banking policy, and deciding which objectives should fit perfectly with the economic objectives of the government. Although the central bank is an independent entity from the executive and legislative powers in the country, the policies it implements should align with macroeconomic policies to ensure a permanent improvement in the standard of living and welfare of the citizens. This is where the Banque du Liban is doing its best in order to support those targets, though these remain coincidental measures of a limited magnitude. It would have an impact that could reach up to circa 1% of economic growth, which is not immaterial. These are wise policies aimed to help boost economic activity within a slowing economic environment.</p><h4>What are Bank Audi's regional ambitions?</h4><p>Our initial expansion strategy (which is still ongoing, but with some slight adjustments) was to enter the very inner circle of real regional players. There are many large banks in the region. When you look at the regional landscape, the national champions in the GCC are NCB in Saudi Arabia, NBK in Kuwait, and QNB in Qatar. These are mainly domestic players, focusing almost exclusively on their internal market. None of them have expanded significantly outside. We can understand those strategies because there is so much wealth in their domestic market. For us, it is a different story. We became too big with respect to the size of our domestic economy, and we had to expand in order to keep generating economies of scale and efficiency gains. When you look at the regional banking universe, none of those banks are involved in interregional banking, or cross-selling countries and business clients. Regional banking for Audi is cross selling countries and business clients. It is like in trade finance, providing the Saudi importer with the LC opening and the Egyptian exporter with a supply of finance. We have a captive market share because we hold both sides of the equation. There are Kuwaiti banks covering Kuwait, and Saudi banks covering Saudi Arabia, but none of them are really interregional. There are very few real regional players, but a huge need for them exists, so our strategy was to become one of them. There is a very interesting market for cross-selling. Our strategy was to become an important regional player as soon as possible and to become as large as possible. The first results of our strategy are quite enticing and encouraging. We have been able, in less than three years of average activity in three markets only (Egypt, Jordan, and Syria), to build close to $7 billion in customer deposits, representing 22% of the consolidated activity of the group. The recent developments, particularly in Syria, impacted on our growth negatively; however, we are building for the future, so we are not driven by short-term considerations. In our wise management strategies, we adjust very quickly to adverse trends, especially material ones like those we have witnessed in the region, by putting in place a range of contingency plans and all the right buffers in order to protect our bank from “short-term shocks." We entered Turkey at the right time. It was triggered by our view that a presence in Turkey is complementary to our regional presence. The license was provided after the outbreak of the Arab Spring, so it came at an excellent moment to compensate for a delay in the revamped business plan—a delay which was driven internally by a consolidation strategy rather than a growth strategy in Egypt and Jordan on the backdrop of a quick deleveraging in Syria in order to maintain the quality of our assets and to protect our bank from any short-term spillover effects. When prospects start improving, such as in Egypt, we will directly reap the benefits. We are actually looking to generate $45 million in profits from Bank Audi Egypt in 2013, after provisions and taxes. It is not as if we are doing nothing in those countries, but we could have done maybe two times what we are doing today if the environment had been more supportive. Our Turkish subsidiary offers a unique rebalancing opportunity due to the size of the Turkish market and the fact that our operating model in Turkey is proving to be successful. The end result will be considerably to the group's advantage in terms of assets and earnings growth, as well as our rating at large.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones for BLOM Bank over the past year?</h4><p>Frankly speaking, this period was a difficult one for the region. The situation in Syria has been deteriorating and Lebanese banks, including BLOM, have a presence there. Also, almost all banks in Lebanon, even if they lack a Syrian presence, have connections to Syria. Without doubt, the situation there has affected Lebanon in terms of tourism and the broader economy because many tourists, like the Jordanians, come by land, which they can no longer do. Having said that, I would add that the banks were able to absorb the negative effects of the Syrian crisis and are still able to grow, albeit moderately. Overall, the situation has affected negatively impacted provisions due to the reduced growth of the balance sheets once operations in Syria shrank. However, other operations have risen. We simply had a lower growth rate than normal; this is the Syria effect.</p><h4>BLOM Bank has a strong presence in other countries. How are your international operations performing?</h4><p>Our business has been improving relatively well in almost all other countries in the region, including Egypt. We are doing better in that country, and recently launched operations in Qatar and Saudi Arabia, albeit with limited licenses. We have been doing well and achieving good results in Saudi Arabia in terms of investment banking, real estate, and equity funds. In Qatar, our operations are also becoming profitable and are growing. These operations revolve around corporate banking licensed under the Qatar Financial Centre, where we offer private and corporate banking. These operations are also expanding. Our asset management business—whether in Lebanon or around the region—has been expanding significantly. We have also been able to grow in all areas of lending in Lebanon, especially in the retail and housing segments, thanks to the central bank's special stimulus package.</p><h4>How does the stimulus package assist growth and what segments are set to benefit from it?</h4><p>Many areas will benefit from it, but the biggest effect is on lower- to middle-income housing. Meanwhile the economy overall is probably set experience around 1 percentage point more growth of 2%-2.5% rather than the previously forecast 1%-1.5%.</p><div class="quote">“  We see great potential for Islamic banking not only in Lebanon, but also in the region. "</div><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved in recent years?</h4><p>Our products are always expanding. We have products in all areas: private banking, asset management, and funds. The latest fund we issued is on the Saudi Arabian equity market, and is a new product that is performing very well. We have also launched many new retail products, such as a range of credit cards. We have expanded our activities in all areas, and rank in first or second place in all areas. We are also active in non-traditional areas, such as Islamic banking, where BLOM Development Bank is our Islamic banking unit. We have one branch in Beirut, and opened a second branch in 2012 in Tripoli. We are planning to open a third branch soon.</p><h4>How is Islamic banking developing in the country?</h4><p>It is growing. And although it remains of limited scope in Lebanon, its growth is important. In fact, we see great potential for Islamic banking not only in Lebanon, but also in the region. We have a good base here, a good structure, and we can use that in other countries. Islamic banking is becoming increasingly important, especially in the Arab world, which accounts for around 40% of the total worldwide. We foresee major growth potential.</p><h4>What are some of your short-term investment plans?</h4><p>We are planning to open two branches in Iraq, one in Baghdad and one in Erbil, by the end of 2013. We are also continuing to expand our network in Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt—basically, in places where we have a distribution network. For example, in May 2013, I opened a branch in Jordan in the free zone. It was branch number 12 in Jordan. BLOM really controls the retail market. We are by far the number one in car loans in Jordan, with 45% of the market. I think the number two player has a 12% share. Also, in Lebanon, we are the number one in retail credit cards, car loans, and mortgages. Also in Lebanon, we are opening new branches in Beirut and elsewhere. In September 2013, we will open branch number five in Tripoli, the second biggest city in Lebanon. Overall, our branch network is expanding reasonably well in Lebanon.</p><h4>How would you evaluate the development of electronic banking in recent years?</h4><p>We always pursue new developments in electronic banking. We have done things that nobody else has, like e-Cash, for example, namely the ability to transfer funds electronically to people who do not have accounts at the bank. BLOM's customers can transfer money over their computer to someone located remotely, for example. You can send them $500 and they can go to an ATM and withdraw it with the code that you give them, even if they don't have an account with us. We have truly pioneered phone and internet banking. We are advanced in IT, and we mostly develop our systems internally.</p><h4>What was the bank's performance in 2012, and what do you expect for 2013?</h4><p>We have already published our 1Q2013 results, which revealed improvement over our 1Q2012 results. We are still maintaining the best ratios compared to our peers; we have the highest return on equity (ROE) and the lowest cost to income ratio. Even in terms of absolute profit, we had the highest level among banks in Lebanon, which in turn improved our profitability ratios. We are expecting 2013 to be a good year; however, growth will be moderate.</p><h4>Where do you see banking in Lebanon in terms of Basel III?</h4><p>Overall, the level of capital adequacy in the banking sector is already above the 10% level. BLOM is currently at around the 14% level. The banking sector is required to arrive at a level of 12% before 2015, which I think it can achieve. This is a higher level in a shorter period than other international banks have managed to achieve. Also in Lebanon, effectively, almost all of our equity is tier one. The banks here do not issue a lot of subordinated debt, and mostly have tier-one equity, which is the optimum type. I think we are okay in the banking sector, and we have tighter restrictions than have been imposed by the Banque du Liban in terms of reaching these objectives.</p><h4>How do you envision the banking sector evolving in the near future?</h4><p>The banks in Lebanon are very resilient and solid. If the situation improves in the country and the region, I think Lebanese banks are going to see a huge improvement and significant growth. If the situation remains tight and difficult as it is now, due to regional and political factors, I think Lebanese banks are set to grow moderately over the next couple of years. Really, nobody can predict what will happen because it is linked to a challenging political environment. If conditions improve and we regain our tourism industry, we can easily see growth of 6%-8%. If matters do not change, however, we might see a rate of just 1% or 2%. Meanwhile, the question of oil and gas has become essential. If there is the political stability to proceed with this, it could give a major boost to the economy. The investments required can definitely have a major impact on the economy, even before we extract the gas. The question is whether or not foreign companies will invest millions of dollars in exploration. Hopefully, we will have a functional government and be able to continue going down this path.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you evaluate the culture and the evolution of the insurance sector in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>Usually, you evaluate the culture and evolution of a market by comparing it to your neighbors, in this case the Middle East at large. The Lebanese people were the very first in this part of the world to introduce the concept of insurance. Unfortunately today, there are many countries ahead of us. And while we still rank quite highly on a premium per capita basis, we lag behind the UAE, which is the number one in the Arab world. On that front, we also lag behind another neighbor, Israel, by 10% to 15%. Of course, all of this is still far behind the EU and the US. The problem with the sector and its evolution is that it is market-made and not shaped by regulation. Yes, the Ministry of Economy does oversee the sector; however, it is not doing enough to advance the sector, or its evolution mainly by reason of legislative and government paralysis. With the market often unable to reach a consensus, it has problems raising capital. Market forces, private companies, and competition make the Lebanese insurance sector what it is. One notes that the regulatory authority tends to protect existing insurance companies from potential new players entering the market. It can, for example, be quite difficult to register a new company due to certain restrictions in place. One reason for this is that there are already approximately 50 insurance companies operating in a country that should accommodate a maximum of 20, thereby making for a surplus of about 30 companies. Many of those would come back as brokers if they were to shut down their operations, because many are already brokers in reality, operating behind the façade of an insurance company. One suspects that some business people simply prefer to be acknowledged as the president of an insurance company, rather than of a small brokerage house. Sooner or later, these companies will have to face the fact that they are indeed brokerage houses, or else merge with other sector players.</p><h4>How do you assess competition in the sector, and what is the importance of mergers?</h4><p>Let's consider for a moment the case of France; when you work as a broker, you work on small margins. Yet, margins are fast-eroding, which is the price of competition. Expense margins made on every insurance policy account for 55% of the premium, which is a huge percentage. This scenario does not exist in the Arab world. Out of the 55%, what you end up doing is giving a discount to your client in order to face the competition, which is basically price driven. Service is important down the line; you never know the worth of the insurance company you are working for until you make a claim. When you work in insurance, you are in the business of paying claims, not collecting premiums. This is the service that we provide, and is at the very heart of our business. Mergers are very difficult to calibrate. You are either bought out completely, as in the case of LIA, or else there is an imbalance in terms of power. One company is always the stronger. Mergers are also difficult, culturally speaking, because Lebanese people have an inflated sense of pride and exhibit too much amour-propre to accept their realities. The problem is that smaller companies are hiring six or seven additional people in order to look bigger and call themselves an insurance company when in actual fact they are brokers. At that point, they are not thinking about maximizing profit, but about prestige. Large companies are looking to buy others out, or to be bought out. Then, there are the insurance companies owned by banks to contend with. Bank Audi just sold its own such division for solvency reasons at the bank level. Perhaps more companies will go this way down the line, because regulations on the banking sector are much more stringent than those of the insurance sector. These banks have, however, become serious players in the Lebanese insurance market.</p><div class="quote">“  When you work in insurance, you are in the business of paying claims, not of collecting premiums.

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the highlights for Gargour Holding over the past year?</h4><p><span></span>We are trying to maintain our solid position while still investing in the company's growth, despite the turbulent situation in the Levant that has led to economic slowdown. We are building our group for the future. We are determined not to stagnate so as not to fall behind when the situation improves in the coming years. We are finalizing and opening a new showroom in Beirut during 2013 in addition to the expansion of our network throughout Lebanon. We are following the same network expansion in Jordan. For Syria, we have finalized our investments and we hope that the crisis will come to an end soon in order to explore opportunities there. In addition, the group is looking into opportunities in the Levant to also expand in terms of brand representation.</p><h4>What trends can you identify in the Lebanese demand for cars?</h4><p>Some years ago, the luxury market was driven mainly by medium to large cars, while the low-budget car segments were mainly dominated by used cars imported from the EU, and later from the US. Total used-car sales were double the volume of new cars purchased. Over the past two years, the used market has dropped to be replaced by new Korean cars. On the other hand, the fashion trend in the luxury market was moving toward smaller, yet sporty and dynamic cars. The younger generation is tending to move toward compact cars and that is why Mercedes-Benz is expanding its product portfolio in favor of smaller and more dynamic cars, such as the A-Class and CLA.</p><h4>How would you compare the premium car sector in Lebanon with other countries in the region?</h4><p>We cannot compare Lebanon with the Gulf countries, such as Saudi Arabia or the UAE, for two reasons. Firstly, in Lebanon, we have a customs duty that is quite high in addition to VAT. Secondly, the GDP per capita is much lower than the GCC. Nevertheless, Lebanese people like to own the latest models as part of their lifestyle and image. In addition, owning a car is considered as the second investment after a house. The increase in real estate prices has positively affected the sales of luxury cars, which are considered relatively affordable when compared to property. Many of the landlords are wealthy and can afford to make any purchase at any price. Even in New York, few have this kind of cash. Also, there are no taxes on property, so it is almost a tax-free heaven here, except for indirect taxes, such as customs duties on cars and electricity.</p><h4>In terms of sales, which model is in the greatest demand?</h4><p>The most popular models are from the E and C-Classes. Then, we also have our SUV, mainly M-Class and the iconic G -Class, which is sold out. Of course, we also have the S-Class and have recently introduced the A-Class. It is a new concept small car, and will be a perfect fit for the Lebanese market. The AMG version of the A-Class can be sold to the young owner of a Porsche, because the car comes with a very powerful engine. Mercedes is producing a new line that will extend the age range of its customers. At first, there was too much focus on the middle- to high-price ranges, or on certain age groups, but now the brand is increasingly targeting the youth.</p><h4>In terms of the other markets that you cover, which ones are performing best?</h4><p>Jordan is still doing well, despite the turbulence in the Levant. We had enjoyed a strong presence in Syria, but we have been out of activity there for the past couple of years. At the moment, we are developing a project that will not be ready for another year or two. We are looking into the feasibility of constructing an assembly plant in the area for commercial vehicle production.</p><h4>What is your short-term outlook for the premium sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>The premium sector will always be good. I say “always" because, unfortunately, if a customer is in a bad financial situation, their car will be linked to it. The car is a part of their status. Therefore, they will try to maintain the type of car or brand that they are driving. It becomes a question of habit. It is like when you live in a 150-sqm apartment and then you move to a small 75-sqm one; it can take its toll mentally. In addition, around three times the current population of Lebanon have left to work abroad, which creates a major pillar for the Lebanese economy. These immigrants still inject cash into the country and invest further. For instance, the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class took place in mid-2013, when the showroom is ready. All vehicles are already sold out until the end of the year. We do not have enough cars to sell even though they are worth over $200,000.</p><h4>What would you like to add in regard to the automotive sector?</h4><p>The taxis in Lebanon urgently need to be changed; they are terrible. Everywhere else in the world, taxis are clean and neat, but here you see old, dirty, and unregulated vehicles. The taxi fleet in Lebanon is at around 5,000-6,000 vehicles, and with 7,000-8,000 new cars we could project a better image. We have requested the government to introduce an incentive scheme to facilitate this transition where buyers would not pay customs tax or VAT. We also propose a stipulation taxis be changed every five years, to maintain a new fleet. They have done this in Brazil, and now in Sío Paulo there are something like 25,000 new cars—all white, all beautiful, and everywhere. Lebanon would benefit from this.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been Porsche's milestones over the past couple of years?</h4><p>In the past two years, we have focused on growth. Porsche has new products coming, and it is no secret to anyone that we are expanding our product line; hence, we have decided to grow our facilities to better serve our clients. When the number of clients grows, you must expand your facilities and human capital; it is a natural investment. We have a showroom in downtown Beirut and on Corniche El Nahr. Given the economic growth of the Metn region and our need to reach out to our customers, we decided to open another branch outside of Beirut. Our objective is to create a Porsche hub for our clients and enthusiasts. I believe this is a big step for Porsche in Lebanon; our facility is now open and is experiencing huge success.</p><h4>How many cars did you sell 2012, and what are you expecting for 2013?</h4><p>In 2012, we delivered around 300 cars in Lebanon. Due to the high perception of the Lebanese consumer regarding sports cars, we have a high ratio of sports cars sold over four-door sedans, such as SUVs like the Cayenne or four-door Panamera. In the region, because the Lebanese consumer is very educated, aware, and trendy, our sales of sports cars are quite high. Moreover, I think Lebanon has a nice road network as well. Although it is not the nicest in the world, you can climb up the mountains on winding roads; you have uphill and downhill stretches, and you can visit beautiful villages where you can enjoy your car in safety.</p><h4>In terms of the new product lines that you are introducing, what models are you expecting in the short term?</h4><p>For the time being, we have the Panamera. It appeals to many customers that want a sporty car in a four-door sedan, while retaining a Porsche feel in the driving pleasure. We have the Cayenne, which is a very versatile SUVs, as well as the Carrera and all its variants, which range from the Carrera up to the 911 Turbo S. We have both the Cayman, which is a two-door, two-seater coupe, and the Boxster in both versions (Cayman and Cayman S, Boxster and Boxster S). The addition to this product line, as Porsche has already announced, is a smaller version of the SUV, which is due to be launched in early 2Q2014. It will be called the Macan, and is a four-door SUV that is a little bit smaller than the Cayenne. This car is perfect for the Lebanese consumer and the local road network. Being smaller than the Cayenne, it takes up less space and it is a sporty model, despite being an SUV. I think it will reach more clients. We are working toward its launch, and the car itself is wonderful. All we need is a little stability in Lebanon to be able to meet our sales targets.</p><div class="quote">“  We are bound to grow. The whole luxury industry around the world is booming. "</div><h4>How are Lebanese consumers different from your other clients in the Middle East?</h4><p>First of all, I have to say that the Lebanese client is very demanding. Lebanese clients are cultivated toward brands, and they know exactly what they want. When a client comes into the showroom, he knows what he wants and the options available. We find pleasure in configuring a car for a client who already knows what he wants. We closely discuss the specifications with the client to deliver the perfect product according to their wishes.</p><h4>What is your view on the tax levels for luxury cars in Lebanon?</h4><p>The cheapest place on the planet to buy a car is the GCC region. The custom duties are very convenient, at just 4%. There is barely anything to be paid in terms of taxes. On the other hand, in Lebanon, the tax structure is quite high. Around the year 2000, the government reduced it to 50% on high-end cars. As a result, the tax structure is as such: the buyer incurs 50% taxes, 10% VAT, and around another 6.5% for road tax and registration fees, which means that the price is not aligned with the GCC market. Because Lebanese people have businesses in GCC countries, and there is a lot of human talent in the GCC, they travel around Lebanon and every time they come here, they complain of how the prices in Dubai and Saudi Arabia are much cheaper. We hope that there will come a day when our taxes are aligned with the GCC. This would be an opportunity for us because it would definitely increase our sales.</p><h4>Despite the high taxes, you are still selling and growing. What is driving this growth?</h4><p>Today, the economy is stagnant, but we sell cars because we have excellent products in addition to the service we provide to our clients. In times of limited sales, the competition becomes tougher, and we need to keep our clients satisfied. In addition to this, a lot of our business revolves around Lebanese expatriates or those with businesses beyond the country who like to have a car in Lebanon.</p><h4>What sales target are you aiming for in 2013?</h4><p>I anticipate around 15% more sales than in 2012, and the introduction of new models will help achieve this. We also have the Turbo S and the 911GT3, which are arriving in October 2013, and the face-lifted Panamera launched in August. Because they are newly introduced models, there will be an appetite for them, and this will help us achieve our targets.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the luxury car segment in the medium term?</h4><p>We are bound to grow. The whole luxury industry around the world is booming, especially due to the growth of emerging markets like China and India. When you have notable demand, the manufacturers sell more, develop new products, and invest in R&amp;D. And so they give us better products to sell. The problem is that, again, in our part of the world, the market is split between very low-end and very high-end products. This happens in countries that face economic instability. The trend is currently toward low-end models. That is why in Lebanon we see many cars being sold in that segment, and a lot of competition in terms of the financing and insurance of such models.</p><h4>What role does pre-owned cars sales play in your operations?</h4><p>The pre-owned cars sector is a very important business model. When we introduced pre-owned cars as a separate profit center in 2006, we thought that we needed to give the pre-owned customer the same experience that we give to a new car customer. We have created a showroom that is fully decorated as per Porsche CI, with specialized sellers, and we have introduced programs like extended warranties for pre-owned cars. Customers who want to buy a pre-owned car get the same experience as buying a new car, and enjoy the peace of mind of a warranty. For every two new cars we sell, we sell another 1.2 pre-owned vehicles. Because of the profile of our customers, they tend to take quite good care of their cars. When we give warranties, the car is almost brand new.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>How would you assess the flow of FDI in 2013?<br></h4><p>The main mandate of the Investment Development Authority of Lebanon (IDAL) is to encourage investment and attract foreign capital to Lebanon. In the last few years, the turmoil happening in the MENA region has had its toll on the image of the region as a viable destination for investment, and since Lebanon is well known as the region's business hub, we were indirectly affected. From an investor's point of view, regional opportunities and access are more important than local access, and it is the regional picture that matters the most. If the region is unstable, then investing in a country as a means to reach out to the wider market becomes precarious. Since 2011, the Middle East has been passing through challenges with the various revolutions in places like Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, and Syria. In 2012, the conflict in Syria began to escalate and it directly affected the economy in Lebanon. Syria is a neighboring country and our land exports and transit depend on it for us to reach our traditional markets. This resulted in an economic slowdown in some sectors; however, UNCTAD's World Investment Report 2013 and the Arab Investment and Export Guarantee Corporation recently released FDI figures for 2012 that highlighted that, despite the current political and security conditions, FDI inflows to Lebanon reached $3.79 billion. This is an 8.5% increase from 2011, making Lebanon one of the largest recipients of FDI in the region, ranking third after the UAE and Saudi Arabia.</p><h4>Who is currently investing in Lebanon?</h4><p>To understand who is investing in Lebanon, we need to look first at what makes the country an attractive business destination. The country relies on many competitive advantages, among which are its liberal market, strategic geographic location, cosmopolitan lifestyle, the availability of skilled labor, and the soundness of the banking sector, among others. These advantages contribute to attracting investment from three main categories: local investors and expatriates, Arab investors, and international investors. As it is quite well known, Lebanon has a wide diaspora, with many success stories across the globe. Recently, we have started witnessing the re-location of some of their businesses to Lebanon after they were affected in their host countries by the financial crisis and the political situation in some of the Arab countries they are in. The second category as mentioned includes Arab investors, especially from the Gulf area. Lebanon depends heavily on this category of investors. The third category represents international companies that choose Lebanon as a hub for their operations in the Middle East.</p><h4>What figures are you expecting in terms of FDI?</h4><p>Investments that pass through IDAL to benefit from financial incentives and our one-stop-shop services do not represent all of the investments in the country. This is because there are some eligibility criteria, such as the size of investment and number of jobs created, which are taken into consideration. Consequently, in terms of the overall size of investments, and according to the UNCTAD, we reached $3.79 billion in 2012, up 8.5% on the previous year. As such, we are among the few countries that registered an increase in FDI during 2012.</p><h4>What are Lebanon's advantages as a destination for FDI?</h4><p>There are four main advantages: accessibility to regional markets (consisting of 300 million consumers) enhanced by a great number of bilateral agreements; accessibility to human resources—qualified workers can be hired in Lebanon at a very competitive price compared to other areas in the region; accessibility to resources and raw materials—Lebanon is situated in an area that is rich in raw materials; and accessibility to finance—due to a very sophisticated banking and services sector that surpasses our boundaries as we have around 112 branches of Lebanese banks outside Lebanon, targeting the diaspora all over the world as well as Gulf and EU citizens. The deposits in the banking sector are three times the GDP of Lebanon. All of these pillars constitute a well regulated, investor-friendly environment.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<url><![CDATA[much-better]]></url>
		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese economy in 2013?<br></h4><p>Due to the complex situation in Syria, 2013 has been very difficult so far. It has been a quiet year in Lebanon since Arabs and people from the Gulf are not coming. Our economy is really based on tourism, with investment and 50% of our exports coming from the Gulf. Lebanon cannot survive without these people. Christmas and the New Year are very important for Lebanon as between 20% and 25% of the country's GDP comes in December for many companies; therefore, it is still too early to judge. However, I can safely say that it will be a bad year. In Lebanon, we need some political stability and security. If that happens, the public sector can do a lot. Lebanon is a gateway to the Middle East, Africa, and Iraq. More than 17,000 Lebanese live in Iraq. Many delegations visited us here in the CCIA because we are the key to Lebanon. Soon, the situation will be much better in Syria and reconstruction will be needed there, which will be good for Lebanon.</p><h4>What is the importance of the Lebanese diaspora for the national economy?</h4><p>People know that we are a small market with just 4 million people; however, they also know that we number 14 million worldwide. We can open doors in Africa and across the world. The Lebanese are everywhere, especially in the Middle East, and we are very strong in Africa. However, I am not talking about the Lebanese in Brazil or the US, as these people left the country over a century ago. I am talking about Africa and Europe, where there are big companies owned by Lebanese businessmen. They invest here too, when they can, and they are waiting for the right moment to come back and invest. We are sick, but we will never die. We are just passing through a difficult period.</p><h4>How are Lebanese products perceived abroad?</h4><p>It depends on which country we are talking about. In the Middle East, Lebanon is something unique. You cannot replace Lebanon with any other country. It is so near to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, and many have second homes and other interests in the country. They come to see doctors, to shop, and to do many other things; it is a luxury supermarket.</p><h4>How would you assess the agriculture sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>It is very good; however, we need to introduce a plan for the future. The government should help and protect people in this sector. The Chamber is supporting the sector, but people are suffering since they do not have anyone to guide them. Around 60% of our wine production is exported, and we are producing about 10 million bottles. I believe we can produce 50 million bottles, which is what Tunisia produces with the same population. I cannot compare the quality of our wines; in my opinion Lebanese wine is much better.</p><h4>How is the Chamber supporting young enterprises?</h4><p>We are able to open new markets for them and send them abroad to international exhibitions. We are also ensuring that a fund is available to help SMEs. We provide a lot of support, especially for SMEs, because this is what our economy is based on. Although Kafalat gives guarantees for all sectors, it is not for the traders. With our fund, we are doing something for the traders. It is in tandem with Kafalat's projects; we will not be working against its goals. We will become the guarantor between the bank and the people.</p><h4>You are strongly pushing to open the Qlaiaat Airport in the north of Lebanon. What advantages will it offer?</h4><p>This is something that I have been pushing very hard, and something that we wanted to be managed by the private sector. Its aim is to serve two purposes. The first is for low-cost airlines and the second for cargo. It is ready; however, it needs an additional $25 million in order to become fully operational. The real problem is a political one, but one day it will happen and it will be good for the economy.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones during the company's long history?<br></h4><p>The company was founded in 1922, when four brothers decided to establish a business. My uncle, Francis, started bringing in US companies to all over the Middle East. Little by little these Middle Eastern countries started to develop and wanted their own people to work and we had to recede and recede, which is normal—it has nothing to do with good or bad business. There was a boom in Tehran, which helped us a lot. There, we worked a great deal in the automotive sector. Iran has an automobile industry of medium quality, but it is fully integrated. As a country, Iran is very rich, agriculture-wise, tourism-wise, and industry-wise, and that helped us a lot at that time to grow—but not when the revolution came because we had to stop all imports and become smaller. My plan for Tehran was to stay because we have land in Iran and we want to have someone present all the time. Things change and we want to have someone on the ground. In the meantime, we are in talks to see if it is legally possible to import Chinese-made cars into the country. We have a small company in Jordan, and it is a profitable. It is working very seriously on industrial projects with electricity, importing AC units from Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, as well as with finished units. Apart from that we are in Lebanon, of course, and that is quite successful. The company has experienced a lot of ups and downs, but in the last few years we cleaned up all the problems and it is quite a successful company.</p><h4>What are your prospects for the Medawar building?</h4><p>This building will be constructed where our Audi showroom is, as Audi changed the specifications for its showrooms. We convinced the people at Audi that it wasn't good business to use a prime piece of land just for a showroom, so now we are developing the showroom alongside a workshop that is integrated into a high-rise building with a mix of apartments and offices. The apartments will be on the higher levels for people wanting a sea view. It will have the deepest foundations in Lebanon, going below 38 meters. Three or four levels will be dedicated to the showroom and it should be completed in the next four years.</p><h4>Are you planning any other new developments?</h4><p>Kettaneh Construction, which is a completely separate and independent entity with its own shareholders, started business in the real estate sector. Achrafieh 442  will be 16 or 17 stories high, and almost 50% of the units have already been sold. For the company's second project, the people at Kettaneh Construction are working on a site where famous writer Amin Maalouf lived for six or seven years. Also, we have many projects at the planning stages, although nothing has been finalized yet.</p><h4>How is Kettaneh's pharmaceutical business progressing?</h4><p>It used to be a strong sector for us, but it has nearly disappeared. Now, we have started with small, over-the-counter products, and little by little we will start with some pharmaceuticals and baby products. We have expanded a lot and we have opened an office in Dubai just to gain access to bigger and richer markets.</p><h4>What other sectors have more potential for investment?</h4><p>Another sector that has potential is electricity. We have many dealings with Siemens and with companies that used to be under Siemens's umbrella, but that are independent today. We have overhauled two large power stations that needed upgrading and thus permitted an increase in their production of 50 MW each. There are now tenders coming up for new power plants.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>As an icon in the fashion industry worldwide, what is your assessment of the Lebanese fashion industry and how has it evolved?<br></h4><p>Fashion has always been very prominent in Lebanon, and the fashion industry is growing fast with strong talents in the country inspired, in a way, by the renowned elegance of Lebanese woman. When I started, I was surrounded by beautiful women, and this was my first drive to dress them and make them look elegant, so my passion developed into a career. Today, I feel happy and proud that I was able to pave the way for other designers and encourage them to venture into this vocation. I believe that Lebanon is ranked among the top producers of haute couture with an increasing demand from the region and worldwide.</p><h4>How is Lebanon perceived in the region?</h4><p>Lebanon is known to be the hub of fashion in the Middle East and Lebanese woman are known to be very elegant. They are a point of reference in fashion and style.</p><h4>What trends are you identifying in the demand for fashion in Lebanon, and what makes the Lebanese consumer unique?</h4><p>Lebanon has passed through lots of turmoil and was destroyed several times over the years, but this hasn't prevented Beirut remaining the rival of European capitals. This can be understood by analyzing the strong will of the Lebanese and their high perseverance to always be the best despite all the difficulties they might face. The Lebanese have been exposed very often and this has given them an edge to develop a sense of maturity and multi-cultural sensitivity. Having said that, fashion has become an international language and suitable to all cultures and societies; women from all over the world aspire to look beautiful.</p><div class="quote">“  I really believe in our designers, and I am proud of the talent that exists here in the country. "</div><h4>What can be done to make Lebanon one of the top fashion hubs in the world?</h4><p>I really believe in our designers, and I am proud of the talent that exists here in the country; unfortunately, the main drawback is the situation. We need stability in the country to get the best out of people.</p><h4>What are your plans for 2013 and over the short term?</h4><p>We are in continuous development, making new openings in different markets, putting more emphasis on our ready-to-wear collection and accessories, and establishing a perfume line. We are working as well on consolidating our corporate platform. on another note, we have recently launched our collaboration with Evian to create a limited edition glass bottle that is a joint celebration of both brands' pursuit of purity in design. By mid-November, an Elie Saab book published by Assouline and written by French writer Janie Samet will be in the market detailing the different stages of the brand and presenting more than 200 archive images.</p><h4>You designed the interior of the BMW X Series and have worked with MAC cosmetics. How was this process and what other business lines are you looking at working in?</h4><p>I have already worked on many projects that involve my creations and personal style in fields other than fashion and I am always ready to explore new areas to which I can bring my vision. For any business to be successful, you should have a vision and an entrepreneurial sense.</p><h4>In what way do you see Beirut as a source of inspiration?</h4><p>We are the result of our culture and heritage. I'm certainly inspired by my culture and the richness it offers, and having lived in Beirut it has been a great asset and an inspiration for me. In general, this is reflected through my choice in fabrics, rich materials, and the use of warm colors like sand and other natural tones. The sun in Beirut is definitely an emblematic inspiration for me; I even dedicated a collection to it once. When I think of Beirut I also think of the beauty of its natural scenery, the richness of its colors, and its people. I think there is a mood that when one chooses to live in Beirut, it is for better and for worse.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>The political and economic problems in the region have hindered economic activity in Lebanon and reflected negatively on the profitability of most sectors. How did the Lebanese banks manage to contain these negative indicators, and were they compelled to increase provisions on non-performing loans (NPLs)?</h4><p>The deterioration of political and security conditions in Lebanon and in the region over the last two years has had a negative impact on economic activity, as well as the profitability of many sectors. Real GDP grew by an annual average of 8.3% between 2007 and 2010 and retreated to an estimated average of 1.5% a year in 2011 and 2012. This weak economic growth is attributed to a declining level of consumer confidence and investor sentiment, as well as to lower GCC demand for our goods and services, while Lebanon's tourism, migrant transfers, FDI, and non-resident capital inflows are generated mostly from GCC countries. Still, the growth of the past two years was mainly supported by domestic bank credit to the private and public sectors, as credit grew by an average of 7.8% per year, with bank credit to the private sector expanding at a much higher rate. However, the deceleration in economic activity is projected to continue throughout 2013. Lebanese banks managed to contain the deceleration in economic activity, as they are well equipped and experienced in rapidly adapting to changes in business cycles. Further, the Lebanese banking sector has shown over many decades its ability to adjust successfully and to withstand domestic or external financial and economic shocks, in addition to an increased capacity to face and overcome challenges and uncertainties. Specifically, Lebanese banks managed to absorb the economic slowdown in foreign markets, as they are operating in many regional countries such as Iraq, Turkey, Jordan, Egypt, Sudan, and Algeria, as well as in international markets such as France, Switzerland, Belgium, and the UK. In 2012, the quality of banks' loans in some Arab countries, especially in Syria, was adversely affected by developments in these economies. However, the credit risks for Lebanon remained to a large extent under control despite the deceleration in economic growth. Also, banks are continuously trying to improve the quality of their loan portfolio and to take provisions, as the ratio of doubtful loans-to-net total loans dropped to 3.5% at the end of 2012 and the provisions on doubtful debt stood at 75%.</p><h4>What actions have banks recently taken to tighten banking supervision, and do you believe that the Lebanese-Canadian Bank experience will not be repeated again?</h4><p>The Lebanese banking system has made great strides toward strengthening its compliance with international anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards. The sector is driven by the desire to maintain its credibility in the international community, in particular with its correspondent banks; as well as to reassure its depositors, largely Lebanese citizens in the country and from the Diaspora, that their funds will not be jeopardized by inadequate monitoring or compliance practices. In fact, the banks are the custodians of depositors' funds and fully realize that safeguarding these deposits is an utmost priority. Over the last decade, the Lebanese Parliament ratified a number of laws related to AML/CFT. As the legislative process tends to advance slowly, the Banque du Liban (BDL), the central bank, took the initiative by issuing circulars and regulations to address urgent issues, as guidance from the BDL is often issued before the laws themselves are enacted. Some of the important circulars include, for example, Basic Circular No. 126, issued on April 5, 2012, which requires Lebanese banks to implement strict, risk-based know-your-customer (KYC) methodologies for vetting customers' identities, particularly regarding cross-border transactions. It also requires banks to be fully informed about the laws and regulations that govern correspondent banks abroad and to transact business in accordance with such laws, regulations, and procedures adopted by international legal organizations or by the sovereign authorities in the correspondents' home countries. Also, the Lebanese government approved in mid-March 2012 three important related laws. The first includes an amendment to the law on fighting money laundering. The government expanded the scope of Law 318 to include most financial crimes, the protection of intellectual property, the obligation of AML reporting to new categories and sectors (property developers, lawyers, and others), and modified procedures to improve the efficiency of the Special Investigation Commission. The second law deals with the declaration of cross-border money transfers, while the third law addresses exchanging tax information. The draft law on cross-border money transfers included a definition of money that covers, in addition to cash, other means of transactional payment such as commercial debentures and financial papers. According to the parliamentary committee debating this law, persons carrying cash in excess of $20,000 have to declare these funds to Lebanese customs. The third law concerns the exchange of information related to tax evasion and fraud, and gives Lebanon the legal basis to abide by OECD norms adopted by the G20 countries. In addition, Lebanese authorities are developing additional draft laws as necessary in order to eliminate any remaining legal shortcomings.</p><h4>What does it mean for the Lebanese to be ahead of countries in the region for Basel III?</h4><p>Banks in Lebanon are currently implementing the Basel II Capital Adequacy Framework and are required to implement Basel III by the end of 2015. In comparison, the international deadline for the implementation of Basel III is 2019. The BDL issued Intermediary Circular No. 282 requesting banks to reach a ratio of 12% of total core capital-to-total risk weighted assets by the end of 2015, compared to the Basel III-mandated ratio of 10.5% by 2019. To be ahead of countries in the region, and even internationally, means that the Lebanese banking sector is solvent and liquid and is ready to rapidly implement the new capital regulations. The sector will be sending a signal to the international community about its swift adherence to international banking rules and regulations as well as to best industry practices. According to the latest available statistics, the solvency ratio of the Lebanese banking sector exceeded 12% at the end of 2012 (calculated in line with Basel II Accord), which is well above the level of 8% required by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. However, large banks in the country have much higher ratios.</p><h4>The central bank is lending to private banks at 1% interest to stimulate loan growth. What segments of the population will see this money?</h4><p>In early 2013, the BDL launched an incentive program for loans that covered most of the economic sectors, but particularly the housing sector, in an attempt to support economic growth through banking loans denominated in Lebanese pounds at favorable interest rates. As such, the BDL placed $1.4 billion at the disposal of banks at an interest rate of 1%, which means that banks can extend loans to institutions and households at reduced interest rates through this new mechanism, after the amount of a previous mechanism was fully utilized. The banks and the market responded positively to the program to the extent that the amounts allocated for new projects and a large portion of the amounts allocated for housing loans were rapidly utilized.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What steps are being taken to promote the financial markets in Lebanon?<br></h4><p>In an effort to foster the development of the financial markets in Lebanon, the Lebanese parliament endorsed and promulgated the Financial Market Law No. 161, in which I had the honor to participate. We have been discussing organized financial markets since 1996. Many drafts were made, but in the end the new law was finalized with the help of the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, and was voted in by parliament in August 2011. The new law, which is now under implementation, dictates the appointment of a new capital market authority formed of six members (three of them are experts that are full time) in addition to a chairman (the governor of the Banque du Liban). This capital market authority will be responsible for developing, creating, and establishing all the regulations for the financial market in Lebanon. Members of the authority are preparing the regulations related to transparency, governance, and disclosure with help from the World Bank and experts from the central bank. We are placing great hopes that the authority will be like those of London, Paris, or New York. Also, the new law provides for the establishment of a special financial market tribunal to settle and look into all disputes concerning the financial markets to avoid going to the lengthy procedures of normal tribunals. It has disciplinary as well as regulatory powers. Another important point in the new law is that within one year the Beirut Stock Exchange (BSE) will have been transformed into a joint-stock company from its current status as an official establishment. In the first step, all the shares will be held by the government, because currently the government owns it, but within six months it has to be privatized and sold; however, the law does not say to whom. Therefore, it is left to the financial authority to decide how much of a stake the government will retain.</p><h4>What are the main challenges facing Lebanon's capital markets?</h4><p>We are among the remaining countries that have a stock exchange that is considered a government institution. Most of the exchanges now are purely private companies. As well, there is a lack of trust and confidence from institutional investors due to the absence of a capital market authority. In terms of companies, many private businesses are family-owned and they hate disclosing their activities.</p><h4>How would you assess the stock market's activity in 2013?</h4><p>Market activity at the BSE witnessed a drop in trading movement during the first four months of the year. Cumulative trading during this period totaled 13.6 million shares valued at $88.5 million, compared to 17.3 million shares for a value of $126.2 million for the corresponding period of 2012. This represents a decrease of 21% and 30% respectively on the volume and value of shares traded. On the other hand, the stock capitalization of the listed shares increased by 5.4% to reach $11.1 billion at the end of April 2013 against $10.5 billion at the end of April 2012.</p><h4>Where are the current investment opportunities in Lebanon?</h4><p>The best opportunities in Lebanon are in the real estate sector and the large banks. I believe that most shares listed on the BSE are traded at around or even below their net book value because of the political and security turmoil in the Arab countries surrounding Lebanon, and not due to sell-offs led by poor investor sentiment. That is why I believe that the current prices of most listed instruments provide a good investment opportunity for local or foreign investors willing to diversify their portfolios.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What have been the milestones of AROPE Insurance and the insurance sector in general over the past two years?<br></h4><p>Despite the slowdown in the Lebanese market, a new traffic law was published at the beginning of 2013. Third-party liability insurance covering material damage became mandatory in addition to the compulsory bodily injuries insurance stipulated in 2003. Unfortunately, this law was put on hold due to many legal flaws. As for AROPE Insurance, the past two years were digitally fruitful. AROPE Insurance was the first insurance company in Lebanon to develop a mobile app with unique features to provide full assistance on the go. It can be downloaded from Apple store, Google Play, and Blackberry App World. Our website was re-designed, a new mobile website was developed, and social media activated to give us a full presence in the digital world to better communicate with our customers.</p><h4>What are your rankings in Lebanon's insurance sector?</h4><p>Today, customers are less price-sensitive, but quite demanding in terms of the quality of service they seek. Consequently, what differentiates one company from another is neither product nor size, but rather customer service. Committed to being a customer-centric company with a good reputation, AROPE Insurance's focus is also on achieving excellent bottom-line results. In 2012, the company held a market share of 10.1% in the life business and 6% in the non-life business. We rank fourth in terms of production in the life and non-life business among 52 insurance companies operating in Lebanon. We are proud to rank first or second based on bottom-line results. Now that the Insurance Control Commission (ICC) has started publishing detailed figures of sector companies—the last report was in 2011—a clearer view of the market has emerged.</p><h4>What can be done to increase the attractiveness of the insurance sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>Even though Lebanon ranks high in the region in terms of insurance awareness, I believe we still have long way to go. Insurance is negatively perceived by customers and considered, most of the time, as a burden or a tax to be paid, rather than a tool of protection. However, looking at the figures, we can clearly see the amount and number of claims that companies pay on a yearly basis. Investing in educating people about insurance is a major role that our government, the ICC, and the Association of Insurance Companies in Lebanon (ACAL) should play in order to better position the market.</p><h4>How has your product portfolio evolved in recent years?</h4><p>We are market leaders in motor insurance, and one of the major players in life insurance. Our focus is on the personal line of business, wherein we perceive the future. There is a need for such protection in our market due to the weakness of the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) and the absence of social support from the government. Most of the time, Lebanese citizens must secure at least their own health insurance, retirement plan, and education plan for their children to preserve their financial stability and ensure the future of their families in case of unforeseen events.</p><h4>How does AROPE Insurance work with BLOM Bank?</h4><p>For us, every branch is a hub, and we operate a one-stop shop model to answer all customer inquiries. Customers visit the bank not only to execute financial transactions, but also to settle bills. Insurance has become a part of these transactions, due to the introduction of mandatory insurance and as a guarantee on bank products.</p><h4>What needs to be done to enhance the regulatory environment?</h4><p>Our regulatory environment requires improvement since it doesn't properly regulate all industry activities and products, especially considering that the last amendment was published in 1999. Because of the political environment and instability, there is a slowdown in passing new laws. A new draft insurance law has been shelved for many years now.</p>]]></richbody0content>

		<richbody0content><![CDATA[<h4>What does Lebanon represent for Total's operations in the Middle East?</h4><p>First of all, Total has been present in the Middle East since 1924, and we, Total Liban, have been present in Lebanon since 1951. Despite the unstable situation and all the difficulties we faced during the war, we stayed, which made us the only major international company present in the marketing retail and business in the country. The offshore potential of the country creates interest for other international companies, but for Total it is just a continuation.</p><h4>What is your outlook for the Lebanese energy sector?</h4><p>The Lebanese energy sector could change a lot if the offshore exploration to be undertaken following the current licensing round proves successful. The upstream segment of the Total group aims at finding new petroleum reserves and increasing our production in a manner respectful of human safety and the environment. Total is also a deepwater pioneer; we successfully drilled the first experimental well under 1,714 meters of water in the Mediterranean Sea in 1982. Therefore, after being in Lebanon for so long, we sought qualification as a right holder operator in the offshore licensing round. I believe the government is working hard to create a comprehensive contractual, legal, and tax framework for petroleum exploration and production. For that, stability and transparency are key. You need to be sure that, in 20 years, you will still be able to produce and work in the country. There have been some promising discoveries in the Levant Basin in the Mediterranean Sea, but in any exploration project, risk exists. You may not find the resources or the economic potential you are looking for. Until you have drilled, nothing is guaranteed. An offshore exploration program requires excellent technical teams, recognized expertise in large-scale projects, and significant investments. We have a lot of expertise to give and share.</p><h4>How would you assess the regulatory environment in the energy sector in Lebanon?</h4><p>I think the government has been very active. The Petroleum Administration's selected members are highly professional and represent various fields of expertise. I am not surprised by this, as the Lebanese are very well known in the region as well as worldwide for their high qualifications and level of education. We also got the opportunity to participate in workshops with the government, where we shared our views on what would be attractive for international companies when deciding to invest in the country.</p><div class="quote">“  It is not unusual that an oil and gas company invests in challenging environments. "</div><h4>What are the challenges the energy sector is facing?</h4><p>It is not unusual that an oil and gas company invests in challenging environments; oil and gas resources are often trapped in hostile environments like deserts, mountains, and in deep sea locations. Lebanon is a net importer of oil and gas, and, as such, is totally dependent on market trends and situations. So, if Lebanon can realize its dream to become an oil and gas producer, the country will surely boom while its economy and oil and gas industry will develop. This would spark new activities within the country.</p><h4>What is your vision for the future of Total in Lebanon, and for the energy sector?</h4><p>Total has a leading position in the distribution of petroleum products in Lebanon; we still aim at being in the lead while respecting the safety rules established by the Group and preserving the environment. Speaking of the Group in general, the aim is not only to accelerate our business growth, but also to progress in areas as fundamental to our activities as safety, diversity, talent management, logistics, communications, and innovation. In fact, corporate social responsibility is the foundation of Total's strategy and focuses on three major issues: meeting energy needs while tackling the challenges related to climate change and natural resources; managing and curtailing the impact of the Group's operations on people and the environment; and helping to drive local social and economic development. In this same spirit, Total launched with the Faculty of Engineering at St. Joseph University the first Master's in Oil and Gas in English. We are a long-term partner and the best example is our long presence in Lebanon, during good times and less fortunate ones!</p>]]></richbody0content>
